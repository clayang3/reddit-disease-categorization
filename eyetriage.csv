ak7eee,Sticky: So You Have an Eye Problem,"This subreddit was created by ophthalmologists and optometrists due to a flood of patient questions in other related subreddits about their own ocular health. Ideally, we will have professional eye care providers volunteering their time freely to **assist** those with the most concerning-sounding symptoms or histories. However...

**Online advice will never replace an in-person medical exam, ESPECIALLY for ocular concerns**. Symptom description is often too vague and physical exam findings are extraordinarily specific, and too microscopic for you to see or even usually for you to take a good picture of yourself. Also, our advice **is not and can not be construed as true medical advice, given that there is no physical exam or real way for us to follow up/through on your problem. This subreddit's purpose is NOT to provide direction, advisement or recommendations for your problems**. In a legal sense, that is impossible. But there is a high demand for help, and we will do what we can.

At the current time, we will still welcome layman questions about general eye topics in other subreddits such as r/ophthalmology.  However, if your question is in regards to your own eye problem, it will be redirected here.

Please understand that given the high legal liability of telling someone ""Eh, you're probably fine, don't worry about it,"" that even the most innocuous-sounding complaint may not receive a satisfactory answer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Physicians and optometrists:** we welcome and are grateful for the volunteering of your time here. Back in r/ophthalmology, if you would like to be recognized for your volunteer efforts in r/eyetriage, please send me a PM and we will first check to verify your volunteer activity on this subreddit, then discuss it from there.

akawcq,Double vision - is there anything I can do?,"I'm 16 and first noticed horizontal binocular double vision 5 months ago. I don't think it'd be safe for me to drive and I spend most of the day with one eye closed so that I can read the board at school.

Yesterday an optometrist confirmed that I have double vision, but otherwise perfect eyesight. She wanted to find a cause before prescribing prism so I've been referred to an ophthalmologist, but the waiting time will most likely be around 4-6 months. 

In the meantime, is there anything I can do to alleviate the double vision? Covering one eye gets rid of it, so am I able to at least wear an eye patch? Or should I just ask for prism lenses? I'd appreciate any advice, as it's becoming increasingly frustrating. 

Thank you :)

I didn't take my flonase that evening, and I went to a glaucoma specialist the next day, after starting dorzolamide eyedrops, and my pressures were 17 right, 12 left, the next day.

They are extremely bloodshot in the morning and last an hour or two after waking up, then they somewhat clear up during the day and flare up again at night, however they are still visibly red all day, just to a lesser degree. They are particularly bad in the corners of my eye towards my nose. 

I am a contact lens wearer and have worn them every day for several months and I never sleep with them and I take good care of them and my eyes like I'm supposed to. I've worn glasses for a day and it didn't help, and I don't think it's the contacts anyway because it's the worst when I wake up and I haven't been wearing them for 8 hours obviously.

akvp5p,"blurred vision in one eye, no answers from doctors","For about 6 months now my vision has been blurry in my left eye. It started when I got my first pair of new contacts, and brought it up during my follow up visit and was told the prescription is right. 

About 4 months later, I was in a car accident where I had flashes of light in the same eye that was blurry due to a concussion, so I had another appointment as well as a visit with a retinal specialist. Luckily, nothing was wrong with my sight but during these appointments I again brought up how my left eye is always blurry. 

In all, I’ve had my prescription checked 3 times in the past 6 months and each time they say it’s the same in both eyes (-5.25) and that it’s most likely due to dryness or it’s the contact so I should switch the brand at my yearly appointment (which would be in July). Normally I would agree, but eye drops don’t make it better even temporarily and if I switch my contacts I still have blurred vision in the left eye. 

At this point I’m not sure what to do, because I’m only able to see the eye doctor 2 times in a year for free, and the retinal specialist was on a lien due to the insurance so I can’t afford any eye appointments but the eye strain is constantly giving me headaches and my only glasses are 5 years old so they’re the wrong prescription (and my left eye is still blurrier in them too). 

What could be the cause of the blurred vision??? Thanks!! (-: ",1,18,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/akvp5p/blurred_vision_in_one_eye_no_answers_from_doctors/"")",2019-01-28 19:11:10,

al42zj,thoughts on after-eye-surgery vision,"I'm just wondering what other's think of this....

What I see now:

Can read books, smart phone, read instructions, etc all without glasses and all without needing to adjust arm length.

Can walk around, jog without glasses

Need glasses to drive, bike, hike, kayak, and watch TV

My activity level is pretty high, but I don't mind wearing glasses.

I love to bike, kayak, and hike. So to me, clear vision and depth perception are very important. I don't mind wearing glasses to achieve this.

However, after the surgery, I would still like to be able to read, look at my phone, etc without needing reading glasses.

I'm just wondering what other's think of what my Dr. said.

Here are the notes from the Doctor:

LEFT eye first
Lens options discussed with the patient, elects for monofocal lens, now wants to aim for near vision (-2.75 to -3 dpt) Wants a clear lens not yellow Patient is also interested in discussing possibility of mini-monovision Patient is also interested in astigmatism correction during cataract surgery
Patient understands that he will not see at distance without glasses but going forward, if the right eye needs cataract surgery as well, it can be offset by OS -2.25 dpt to -2.5 dpt OD emmetropia or intermediate

al7oke,Blind spot(?) fusing objects together.,"When I was about 15, about 10 or so years ago, I had two separate instances - spread out about 6 months apart - where I lost partial sight for a couple hours. When I would look at someone’s face, it wasn’t there. Instead, the area directly above where their head should be was fused to their shoulders. So basically, anyone I was looking directly at appeared headless.

There was no dark area in my vision and no headache associated with it, just areas fused together. Maybe just mild sensitivity to light, but no other symptoms other than what I described. I only went to the nurse’s office and closed my eyes during these instances, and never saw an ophthalmologist, as this only lasted a short duration.

I’ve always wondered what could have caused this. I’ve never talked to anyone else that’s experienced it and it only happened twice, briefly. I’ve googled the symptoms before but haven’t really come across anything that sounded exactly right. Not sure if it’s worth mentioning, but I wear glasses for astigmatism, though did not at the time.

alfb6p,"Temporary blurred vision, went away in 10 minutes. Worried.","Hi, I'm 18 years old and a HUGE hypochondriac. I worry about every single health changes that happen within my body. I recently had an appointment with an ENT about a ear problem.

Now I'm worrying about the slight blurry vision I had around 3-4 months ago. I was playing a game on my computer when suddenly it seemed like I couldn't focus and read anything. It's very hard to describe but the ""Migraine Aura"" description is really really close to what I was experiencing. I went into slight panic and stood up and got myself something to drink and stopped using the computer. The vision came back fully in about 5-10 minute time and nothing has happened since.

Is this something I'm supposed to be worried about? I can't stand my worrying any longer and I can't really afford to go to another doctor for this problem (they also rarely calm me down anyway, I jump straight into the next conclusion).. what are the chances that this is something serious?

I do not have any vision problems as of yet and no blurry vision stayed after I had this episode. I have 20/20 vision.

algvhu,anyone have Experience with implanted contact lenses,"I’m not a candidate for LASIK (prescription is too extreme- far sighted), and while I was recommended getting my lenses replaced when I went in for a consult, my optometrist believes this is not the best option for me (not a candidate for multi focal bc of astigmatism), and suggested implanted contacts. The space where they would go is narrow, as I’m far sighted (30 whatever measurements for that space), but I can check with a specialist to see if that would even be an option for me. I dislike my contacts (ridged gas permeable), as they get easily irritated because of their small size, so stuff gets underneath them a lot.

aljqmv,Worrying eye issues,"Hey everyone, for the past 3 months or so I will sometimes wake up in the morning with excruciating pain in my left eye, tears pouring out all over my face, with my eye being very red. It first happened maybe a few months ago in the middle of the night, then again in November and once after that. Now it has happened to me for the past 2 mornings - when I woke up Monday I felt like there might be something in my eye, so I rubbed it in my tiredness and it immediately erupted into tears and 8/10ish pain. Today when I woke up there wasn't much pain, but my eye was tearing up and extremely red/irritated looking. It's always been the left eye, and it will also be sensitive to light. Sometimes it causes a sensation in my sinuses/runny nose but this could be pain related or not related at all. It eventually goes back to normal after around an hour. However, as I'm writing this it feels like there's something stuck in my eye (I don't think that's the case, as I've rinsed it out several times and this has happened often and always gone away)

The only eye issues that I know of having is something with my muscles from what I remember, where if something is close to my right eye it will follow along with it separate from the other. i.e. , my eyes don't work well together often times.

A headache never follows and I get no other symptoms relating to TIA at all. But I've just read that a headache usually follow ocular migraines.

I really can't afford stressing about this because of all the work I have this school semester, this is the last one until I graduate.

alz96d,Mystery eye disturbance that Militarty docs cant find.,"My left eye was hit with a military grade lazer (rifle) 2-3 years ago. I had on protective glasses but they were only ballistic, not laser proof. 

I am a male, 35+ yo, no smoking, no physical eye trauma, occasional alcohol, active and healthy, 2 coffees a day. 20/10 vision as a kid, 20/20 now.

The laser came across at an angle (from right to left) and my left eye was sore (as if someone punched me) and I lost night vision for that night.  I was fine the next day. 

Fast forward one year and my left eye started to have a 'blurr' in it. Imagine looking through a pair of sunglasses with a vertical scratch, or a vertical water bubble. It was very apparent when light came at from behind and I was looking forward. I thought it was an eye booger but it was not. 

Present day, The visual disturbance is consistent, left of center, and when I shift my eyes right and then left, it slides across my left eye from left to right (no physical sensation, just the optical). It is always in the same place, the same size, and reacts to the same stimuli and conditions. 
The same occurs when I look hard left to right but not as pronounced. 

Here's where the differentiation comes in. 

It only happens in medium light (outdoors or indoors.) It does not exist in direct or high intensity light. It is also present when I am wearing sunglasses (depending on the outdoor light intensity). 

I know it isnt psychosomatic because it catches me off guard when I am driving and looking around. 

When it is extremely sunny, the optical disturbance goes away. When it is dark, it goes away. But when it is medium light, or for example, i look up at the ceiling fan right now and shift my view, the vertical visual disturbance is still there and shifts with my view. (It looks like a scratch on a pair of glasses does when I look at the light and shift my eyes left and right. 

I have been to the military retinal specialists, they have dialated and conducted two scans and two inspections and my retina is fine and they dont see any floaters. They conductrd a luminsesnce eye drop test and there isnt a scratch anywhere. 

Interestingly: They dialate my eye and the disturbamce goes away. They then look in there and cant see anything (everything looks normal).  I leave (feeling like a malingerer) and the disturbance is gone until the next day when my eye is back to normal. 

So I'm open for suggestions or ways I can prove what the hell is wrong with my eye. Is it a lens scratch? A pre-cataract? Are they looking in the wrong places? Can they NOT dialate my eye and look for it? It really strikes me as some sort of lens issue because it comes and goes based on the variability of the light and it is consistent in placement when I look left to right and up and down (left of center). 

Please, any advice would be great, Im kindof going crazy. Thanks.

am34pj,Hypersensitivity to red color causing pain in the eyes,"Hello,

This is a xpost from r/AskDocs but I think this might be interesting from some of you here. If xpost is innapropriate I will remove it.

I have this problem since a long time, I can't remember if it started at some point or I just always had this, but my first memories realizing it was during my teenage.
I never really talked about it since I thought it was a common thing everybody had, like we like to think that bulls are annoyed by the color red, or that red is an ""aggressive color"" in our culture. One day at work, I was working on the computer (I am building websites) and changed a page background color from red to blue to relax my eyes. One of my coworker asked my why I changed the whole identity of the page I worked on, thinking I was mistaking. I explained him that I never understood people thinking it was a good idea to have a full background in red, since it was hurting the eyes so much. Then a discussion took place and I realized it wasn't such a common thing.

The symptoms are, the more red I have in my field of view, the more it will hurt my eyes, physically. The pain looks like when you have a migraine, but only the eye pain, no headache. The more it last, the more it hurts and would force me to look away or close my eyes. It feels like my blood pressure gets higher (this is only how I feel it) and I get very irritable. In very extreme cases I got nausea, but this rarely happen. After being exposed to red color for too long, my vision change, I like to describe it as an ""instagram filter in the eyes"", I would say colder. I interpret this as if I see all the colors without their portion of red in it. Purple become plain blue for example.

I'm a male in early 30's, work behind a screen (but it started before that). I'm 90 kg / 200 pounds for 1,81m / 6', Caucasian with brown eyes, no specific medical issues nor medication. I'm a smoker (pack a day), drinking quite often (one beer every day or so and can get drunk in the weekend) and have no use of recreational drugs lately that are worth to mention (very rare). I did use psychotropics substances (LSD, PCP, etc.) during my teenage, enough to be relevant here.

Doing any research on this topic led me nowhere but to ""red eyes"" problems or photo-phobia, but nothing related to a hypersensitivity to a specific color frequency.

I have decided to take an appointment with an ophthalmologist (in a month), but I fear that these symptoms might be very specific and uncommon, and would like to have a feedback and ideas on it.

I hope this was clear and enough detailed. Thanks a lot for your time.

amf811,Shadow that comes and goes,"Hello, r/eyetriage

I had posters on r/ophthalmology before to ask about retinal tears that 'healed' and ongoing issue with eye floaters, and flashes (which stopped a month back) 

I had got a dilated exam by an ophthalmologist last month, they said I don't have to worry. Everything looks fine I.e. no detachment.

Last week I started seeing a dark spot in my vision intermittently. It's not central but still in the area in vision where monocular vision overlaps. It is often circular in shape has a darker border, the middle section is lighter grey/brown. Though it resembles one floater I have, it's way bigger. 

The catch is it disappears as soon as I notice it. And after closing either eye I can't find it. 

I have a scheduled eye appointment next month. I am wondering what this might be and if I should schedule appointment sooner.. 

Other eye issues I have - nearsightedness, bilateral astigmatism, high introcular pressure (no treatment at this time)

amk4lx,Help with possible accommodation focus spasm/constant contraction?,"Had blurred vision (not bad enough I can’t see jusy so things aren’t quite clear) for a couple of weeks. Think it might have been happening for a while but not so I notice and it got noticeable after a day when I was really stressed. Optician check found that my “accommodation focus was all over the place” and I have been referred to a specialist in binocular vision. Got to wait for that to come through. I am on screens pretty much all the time for work (like 8-9 hours a day then am home on my phone/watching tv)

I have health anxiety. since the check my anxiety has gone through the roof.

I have read it can be caused by tumours and other horrible things and the more stressed I become the worse I feel.

I have read that it often comes and goes but mine seems pretty consistent. sometimes when I’m distracted it doesn’t seem as bad.

I have tried to calm down but wondered if there were any tips for relaxing the eye muscles (if it is a spasm) and whether anyone knew whether it is likely to go away on its own if I do manage to calm?

Also what the referral is likely to look for as I’m really worried about it.

They've also in the last visit added macular edema (sp?) to my condition list. Eyesight has never been stellar to begin with (-6.75 left eye, -5.5 right, astigmatism in both eyes) but with each visit to the hospital I've noticed the left eye get worse (on my first visit I could read the 3rd line of the chart, then only the top, then couldn't see the board at all but could count fingers, now can't count fingers) My blood pressure was deemed normal after several checks and I've done about 12 blood tests that have all come back normal (more results on the way). They've recommended injections to the eye but it'll be another month or so before I can have them. My current clinician believes there could possibly be a lesion or tumour blocking the artery and has put me down for a CT scan but NHS cuts being what they are that's also at least a month wait.  I have regular stinging headaches located on the left side which could possibly come from strain but are still worrying - am I right to be as worried as I am and should I shell out ridiculous amounts of money to get it seen to immediately or wait to be pushed through the system for free but with an extremely long waiting period?

anrth8,Help with cloudy RGP contacts,"Hello - I'm looking for advice on fogging issues with my new RGP contact lenses. Any advice, recommendations or shared experiences would be very much appreciated!!

I was fitted in GP lenses this summer and after several trials my Dr. is happy with the fit. We made incremental adjustments to the diameter to stop the lenses from dropping, from 8.0mm up to 10.5mm. We also tried a few different Boston materials - started with EO, tried ES (which resulted in 3 + 9 o'clock staining) then XO (not as comfortable) and eventually went back to EO.

Progress has been good, but we can't seem to find a solution for the fogging, which has been present since day 1. I've tried just about every cleaning, soaking, rewetting and eye drop solution combination available in Canada...

Cleaning: Boston Advance Cleaner, Supra Clens, Clear Care
Soaking: Boston Advance Conditioner, BioTrue, OptiFree Puremoist as well as a few other Bausch + Lomb + OptiFree solutions.
Rewetting (for insertion): B+L Sensitive Saline, Refresh Celluvisc, Refresh Optive Gel Drops, Hylo Dry Eye Drops (including the gel varietry)
Eye drops (during the day): Blink Tears, Hylo Drops and a few other lubricating drops w/ preservatives
The best combination I've found so far is to clean with Boston Advance Cleaner, rinse with B+L Saline then soak in Optifree Puremoist overnight. I put 3 drops of Celluvisc in each lens before I insert in the morning.

As for the fogging - it gradually builds within the first 3-4 hours after I insert the lenses. My vision is pretty cloudy after that point, but it seems to come and go intermittently throughout the day - some days better than others.

ao47t9,Do I have severe digital eye strain? Please help!,"I'm writting this because I'm in a pretty desperate situation and it's starting to look like Reddit is my last hope. Basically I've had a computer ever since I was a kid(I'm now 26) and never had any eye related problems before(other than having to get glasses), no matter how much time I spent in front of it. So it all started around 3 months ago on this particular day when I spent almost the whole day being in front of the computer. I did take short breaks every now and then though. Not sure exactly how many hours had passed(I'm guessing around 12?) when all of the sudden I felt this strong stinging pain and I'm not sure if I felt it in both of my eyes or just in the left one. I'm pretty sure this was caused by the fact that sometimes I forget to blink as much as I should. I looked in the mirror and my eyes look pretty red and tired so I turned off my computer and went to sleep.

Ever since that day, I can no longer sit in front of the computer for long periods of time like I used to even though I'm always forcing myself to blink more. In fact, I can only do 1 hour computer sessions at a time before I feel like I need to take a long break from it (also around 1 hour), anything longer than 1 hour in front of the computer screen and my eyes will either get tired, dry or bloodshot. Sometimes I would even feel all of those symptoms at once which is a nightmare to deal with since it's happening every single day since then. Whenever my eyes feel dry and/or tired and I look in the mirror, the surface of my eyes actually looks wet! Which is very confusing and I'm not sure what's happening with my eyes. How could they feel dry if they are actually wet?
 
When my eyes get bloodshot, I often start to feel stinging pain in the area that is red. If I take my eyes off the computer or TV or sometimes even the phone, all the pain and dryness/tiredness slowly starts to go away during the 1 hour break that I usually take. I also started seeing [eye floaters](https://media.giphy.com/media/mYhIQzPpY17xe/giphy.gif) pretty regularly when I look at something bright like the sky for example, which is worrying me a lot.
 
I also want to mention that I've always kept a considerable distance between my eyes and the computer screen, about an arm's length or 60 cm which seems to be more than enough from what I've read and I'm always getting at least 8 hours of sleep per night so I can’t tell what the problem is.

**What I've tried so far**:

**1**) Visited an expensive eye doctor that prescribed me some regular eyedrops called Augen Tropfen. Used them for a month but didn't do much for me.

**2**) Visited another expensive eye doctor that prescribed me Thealoz duo eyedrops along with Artelac Nighttime Gel. Still taking them to this day but I feel little to no improvement.There are times when I feel like the eyedrops help a little but to be honest most of the time I feel like they don’t do much.

**3**) I've set the contrast and brightness of my monitor to 0. As low as it gets. My eyes still feel the same symptoms after each 1 hour computer session (more or less). If I were to set the contrast and brightness values back to what they were before I would last less time in front of the computer. Around 30 mins.

**4**) Tried staring at the monitor with my glasses. No difference. (And yes the prescription for my glasses is correct as it was confirmed by both doctors but I do not wear them at the computer anyway since I’m nearsighted and see perfectly fine at a short distance).

**5**) Bought a pair of special computer glasses called Gunnar that are supposed to block the harmful blue light. No difference.

**6**) Tried installing a program called f.lux that's also supposed to block the harmful blue light. No difference.

**7**) Took a 2 week long break from the computer. As soon as I started using it again all the symptoms came back.

This is a very annoying situation to be in and I can't even go to work because of it. I'm feeling pretty hopeless so any advice coming from any of you will be greatly appreciated.

ao63xt,Sticky: Try artificial tears first,"An amazing majority of non-serious eye issues can be resolved by using artificial tears. Some pointers:

1) the brand does not matter
2) the contents do; do NOT get anything that says it is for “redness relief” or has an “astringent” in it. Just get “ocular lubricants” only. There are some combination products that have both. Don’t use those either.
3) some are thicker than others. Eyedrops are liquid. Gel drops feel thicker. Ointments are the thickest. Your vision may get temporarily blurry with the thicker stuff, ointment in particular.
4) you can take them a few times a day. If using a bottle, take them up to 4 times a day. If using more often than that, then use non-preserved formulations (the vials with the twist-off cap).

aonyif,Questions about 'Haze' and what I am dealing with after seeing optometrist,"About 6 weeks ago, I noticed that my vision seemed to be off for about 5 days and started having a little pain.  Things were looking blurry and I got nervous and called my Optometrist who also specializes in Occular Disease.

She told me that the good news was that I was not loosing my eye sight but my eye seemingly has suffered some Trauma to the eye.  I said nothing new, just wearing my glasses and nothing physical has happened.  She put me on a steroid / antibiotic drops.  I came back a few days later and then the doctor told me there was some improvement but not great.  She told me to then switch to a pure steroid drop 4 times a day.  Two weeks went by and there was no real improvement.  She has mentioned there was 'Haze' on my eye.  She drew on a diagram on her computer white splotches around a quarter of my right eye's iris.  A couple days ago she said to switch to two drops a day and I am to come back in 3 weeks.  I cannot read any line on the eye exam chart that the technician showed me with the right eye, with no eyes covered I can read all the lines.

Just looking for advice on how to proceed because I do stare at computer screen most of the day and it is quite bothersome and frustrating to try to read as my left eye seems to tire out.  I assume my left eye is compensating for my right.  I am just under 40 yrs old.

aoo8yd,"Sudden damage to my right eye, is it permanent?","TLDR at bottom.

Hey y'all. Last Monday morning I was folding up boxes and somehow, and I don't even know how I can be so clumsy, I poked my right eye with it. I went to the doctor, then to an eye doctor who told me that there was a tear in my cornea, I believe it's called.

Now all fine and good, I just took some eye drops that would kill any unwanted lifeforms trying to live in my tear, slept a lot and lived like a bat. Then I do another checkup, the tear has healed up and we did a quick eye test.

The eye test went horribly, I've lived my whole life with near perfect sight so it came as a shock that I couldn't read anything on the monitor with my right eye, then I did one of those machines that measures my far/nearsightedness and astigmatism and spits out some numbers, pretty cool machine.

Here's some data: https://i.imgur.com/IeZlZ0E.jpg

But the question is, because I'm a very skeptical person. The doctor told me to give it a month because more often than not the eye will correct itself, I just think he told me that to make me feel better because I was obviously very upset with myself.

Does the eye really correct itself? Or should I just give up and get some glasses.

TLDR: Poked my eye, some damage in cornea, eyesight is bad in that eye, does it fix itself?",1,6,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/aoo8yd/sudden_damage_to_my_right_eye_is_it_permanent/"")",2019-02-08 18:53:06,

aov4bu,Worsening light sensitivity after retina surgery,"Hi all, 28/F. Hope this is the right place to ask, but please let me know if not!

Since 2014, I’ve had four retinal procedures to fix tears, and in April 2017, I had laser surgery to repair a retinal detachment. All procedures were in the left eye.

My ophthalmologist told me some light sensitivity may be normal. Over the past two years, though, I feel that it’s gotten increasingly worse. For example, it’s a cloudy day here, but I still need to wear sunglasses in my home to comfortably read a book.

I have a checkup in a couple months, but I can’t get into my doctor before then unless it’s an emergency, and I don’t think this is. However, I’m a bit paranoid considering that when my retina detached, I had no symptoms. I just happened to be meeting my new retinal surgeon for the first time to get a second opinion, and during the exam, he informed me my retina was detaching and took me back for the procedure 10 minutes later.

So really, I guess I’m just looking for opinions about whether this is something that’s just par for the course after multiple retinal surgeries and if there’s anything that can be done about it in the meantime. My job is 100 percent done on a computer, so the light sensitivity is inconvenient as well as uncomfortable.

Other possibly relevant info: astigmatism in both eyes, myopia in both eyes (quite a bit more so in left eye), night vision is so poor that I’m no longer allowed to drive after dark.

aoyfy9,Why is there pain in/behind/around my eye if my eye is perfectly healthy?,"This all starts about a month ago. A friend shined a little toy laser gun light in my eyes and I freaked out. Right eye. Felt like I was getting dizzy/had eye pain leading to constant headaches/something just felt off/zoning out. The pain/discomfort isnt constant but it happens all day. It feels like theres constant pressure there. Seems to be when i move my eye sometimes or blink, but not always. Maybe some (especially night time) light sensitivity. I also feel like my neck is kind of tense on the right side as well. So i went to the ophthalmologist because it was time for my yearly glasses/eye exam anyway. 

The ophthalmologist told me its really unlikely that a toy gun laser could have damaged my eye and that my retina, eyelid, everything looks perfectly fine and there's no swelling or inflammation or any indication anything is wrong and that its probably just psychosomatic. My eye blood pressure is perfectly fine too.

So a week or two passes and my eye still fucking hurts and im getting headaches all the time. I went back to the ophthalmologist and again, same thing, everything is perfectly fine and to just not dwell on it. Told me to wet my eyes 3 times a day with drops and take ibuprofen as needed. The ibuprofen clears up my headache but i can still feel the discomfort/pain in my eye.

A couple weeks after that, I still have eye pain but its not as bad and I dont seem to be getting dizzy as often or zoning out as much. I go to my primary care doctor and he told me if the ophthalmologist told me everything is fine it may be tension headaches and to take muscle relaxers for a week. You could sort of tell he thought I was nuts, though. He told me to come back in a couple weeks if I'm still not better.

So Ive done that and while I guess the pain isnt quite as bad as it was and I dont have as bad (or at all) headaches by the end of the day, it still is in pain and it just doesnt feel right. I may be imagining things but I do feel like its not as bad when my glasses are off. My glasses are 2-3 years old at this point and my prescription has changed but not a lot and the ophthalmologist told me that its unlikely an old prescription would cause what im experiencing.

So what now? Just make another appointment with my PCP? New ophthalmologist? I feel like I'm going fucking crazy! I just cant figure it out. Nothing is outwardly wrong with my eyes but damnit if I'm not in constant discomfort. I'm also kind of scared because my left eye seems to be acting up now. I know this all seems silly and that it probably has nothing to do with a cheap made in china laser gun but i dunno. I feel like everyone just thinks im making things up and its so frustrating.

I bought a new pair of glasses since my old ones were about 5 years old and I needed to correct vision a little more. I had new measurements done, got the pair, had the issue as in the picture ^, consulted in the same clinic again, they said they don't see any issues but offered me to replace the lenses to be the same measurements as in my old pair. Did that, the issue is still present. Tried verifying in several diferent clinics, all said that effectively they're the same but the only difference between them is distance between eye centers. 60mm on old pair and 65mm on new.

ap7cv6,Upper Eye-lid Swollen,"Hi, I don't know how it happened, but 2 days ago my right upper eye-lid swelled up. It's been 48 hours and no improvement.

apj6wl,Both eyes are constantly seeing red and have a static effect,"I've been having an issue with my eyes for over a year where I keep seeing red when the color should be dark or black.  For example, when I wake up in the morning everything is all red when it used to be dim/black in the past.  The condition has gotten worse over the past couple of months.  Is this a problem with the cones or rods in the retinal? When I close my eyes I see these red swirls everywhere. I have night blindness at night. I also see this static effect on a white surface during the day and it's more noticeable on computer screens.

I've seen multiple ophthalmologists about this issue, and they've done the eye-dilation test, and other doctors did an optical coherence tomography and a fundus autofluorescence test, but they keep telling me they're all negative. I ask my latest retinal doctor if there is any other test I could have done and he told me no.

I've noticed that these symptoms started after using a pair of solar eclipse glasses in 2017 that caused me pain hours after using them, and I noticed I had night blindness after using them. But the eye doctors claimed that since they saw no retinal damage from their tests that my current eye issues weren't related the eclipse glasses. Even though I never used to have any eye problems before I used those eclipse glasses.

I've read online there is a test called an ""electroretinogram."" Would this test show any changes to the rods or cones of my eye? Or is there another test I should look for?

aplsfk,How to turn my eyes brown?,"Apologies if this is not the right sub for this, please let me know where is, if that's the case!   


I have light blue-grey eyes that for a lack of a better word, I really, really hate. For personal reasons, I've hated my eye color since I was a child. It doesn't help that my eyes are unusually large and I get a lot of comments on them, even when I wear glasses (am nearsighted). My whole life I've been jealous of my mother and brothers' hazel eyes. I often wear sunglasses when I don't need to, and when I can I wear colored brown contacts. Unfortunately my eyes tend to be sensitive and I often have a lot of trouble and pain from wearing contacts. I heard about a surgery that can change eye color, but unfortunately it seems to only work for lightening the eyes, not darkening.  


However, I've recently heard that there is a drug Lumigan that is used to treat glaucoma, that has the side effect of darkening the iris. There is a lot more information about Latisse which from what I've read is a weaker version and a lot of sources say it only rarely darkens the eye, and it's supposed to be reassuring. I don't care about eyelash growth, I just really, really want to have eyes that aren't blue. Would it be possible to use Lumigan to intentionally change my eye color? I currently use normal saline eye drops for dry eye, would that be incompatible? Would it worsen my mild photosensitivity? 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any other way I could change eye color that I should know about?

apukry,Repeated vision loss since age 14,"Background: male/23 years old. When I was 14 years old I had something that I believe was an ischaemic problem and I lost vision on my right eye for hours, and the blindness slowly went away over a couple weeks (I think a small blind spot is still there but my brain ignores it). My right eye vision is now slightly more blurry and colors appear less vibrant... It used to be my dominant eye but it switched to me left now. The opthalmologist said he has only seen it happen in people 50+ years old. There was a blood clot in the back of my eye where a small artery burst.

Current problem: Since about that age or some years after, I have been getting identical blind spots in both eyes around the center of my vision when I do cardio workouts, drink too much water, drink caffeine, or go to high altitudes (every time I'm on a plane or on a mountain). I also get a tight feeling behind my eyes or maybe in the front of my head. I assume it has something to do with lack of blood flow.

I have said these things to the  optometrist when  I get them checked but he always says everything looks normal. This seems like a different problem than the thing I had when I was 14 because it affects both eyes identically, and is only mild (by the way, it is the exact same pattern every time, and is the ""colorful paint"" type of blind spots).

aqlx71,Question about after images,"Everytime I stare at the tv or my computer screen and then look at the wall I see a sort of ""outline"" of the screen that lasts for a few seconds. I did a bit of research and I think what I'm experiencing is negative afterimages (not entirely sure though). It mostly happens with light and screens, but it can also happen with pretty much any object, just the duration of the afterimage will be much shorter. For example if I stare at a chair for 5-10 seconds and then immediately look at the wall next to it I will see a very very brief outline of the chair (lasts only a split seconds up to a second). Also, the intensity of the afterimages varies from time to time but i'm not sure what is that affects it(light, time of day or how tired my eyes are).

The blackness in that eye only happens when the other is closed. Now this seems to happen with the left eye which was always the good eye.

More strange, it seems that sometimes my eye muscles feel weak but look normal and it feels like an invisible screen.

I've been stressing heavily about this lately so some help or guidance would be greatly appreciated. I have nearsightedness and astigmatism and I go back routinely for my annual check ups. Apparently this year my astigmatism got a bit worse so my doctor wrote me a prescription for new lenses that are adjusted to correct that change.

I get my glasses and they are slightly better than my older prescription, by a small margin, but its been two weeks and my eyes still get watery and a little bit more fatigued with this new pair. Especially with computer usage. My habits haven't changed but my old glasses felt a bit more... easier? On the eyes. These are really good but I really really notice them doing their work.. I took them in to get the prescription and measurements double checked and they all said that its fine but offered to replace them with my old prescription.

I suppose my question is, is there any harm in going back to my old prescription? I still see wonderfully enough with them but it doesn't correct for my latest change in astigmatism. Is there any harm with staying with these new pair of glasses? I mean the vision is really clear and good I just really notice my eyes getting more tired towards the days end.

arc127,"My husband is a medical mystery, so I'm looking for some clues."," Hi all,

My husband has been suffering from some very strange visual symptoms for about six weeks now. I know you can't diagnose, but I'm looking for *possible* avenues of investigation. Mere hints. That kinda thing.

Roughly two weeks after keyhole surgery for acid reflux (fundoplication with hernia repair), my husband complained of head pressure, pain above one eye, predominantly on the right side, and blurry vision in both eyes.

To be more specific about the visual problem, he describes two separate symptoms:

* A green haziness, like a heat haze, over his visual field, more noticeable against bright backgrounds.
* What seems to be a sort of accommodation problem, whereby his eyes are slow to refocus when moving from one object to another. He says it takes around a full second for an image in his visual field to un-blur when shifting his focus to it. This also makes it difficult for him to read -- he can clearly see only the text he is focused on and even nearby words are fuzzy.

He has normal blood pressure and blood sugar. He has also seen an optician and an ophthalmologist. He does not need a prescription for his vision, which is usually excellent, and no problems with the eyes themselves were found. The Ophthalmologist suggested a sinus issue, so we saw an ENT. The ENT prescribed steroid drops for six weeks for polyps and suggested surgery may be needed for narrow turbinates after this point, but was not sure that the visual symptoms had anything to do with the sinus issue.

He has an odd symptom related to his jaw, if that's relevant - opening his mouth fully causes the right side of his jaw to appear to bulge out at the joint. And his GP prescribed him Amitryptyline as he thought it may be a simple case of tension headaches. Neither the drops nor the Amitryptyline seem to have helped in any way.

I'd be really grateful if anyone could suggest what a decent next step would be for this high strangeness. Thank you very much in advance. :)",2,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/arc127/my_husband_is_a_medical_mystery_so_im_looking_for/"")",2019-02-16 11:20:45,

ari77l,Eye Allergy and Flashes of Light PLEASE HELP!,"Hey reddit. Ever since I was a kid I always see flashes of light. In the dark I would see millions of faint circles and flashes. Whenever I press on my eyes with my fingers I see lots of lights with different color and shapes moving around. It just happened throughout the day when I see flashes of lights. I thought it was normal so I didn't tell my parents. When I was around 8 years old I moved to California. At that time I was really scared of ghost and stuff so whenever I would take a shower I wouldn't close my eyes in fear that a ghost might appear or something like that. That resulted in a lot of shampoo in my eyes. Also at that time I watched a lot of videos on my Ipad really close to my face. One day in November of 2014 I woke up with my eyes very sensitive to light. When I went to school my eyes would constantly water, burn, scratchy feeling, and stinging. I didn't tell anyone because I was confused. To cope with my eyes I would get water bottles and put them on my eyes which provided 3 seconds of relief. I felt embarrassed whenever I did this. Around 2015 I started to worry a lot about my eyes because I was gonna go to a new school. So I went online and searched what is going on with my eyes. After reading many articles and watching videos I was convinced that I had dry eyes since I had most of the symptoms.One day I told my mom that I couldn't look at people in the eyes because I had dry eyes. She didn't believe me and said I just lacked confidence. One day I told her again and she gave me her dry eye drops. When I put them in my eyes they didn't help at all. During that time I suffered constantly, every second my eyes would water, sting, and burn,to cope I kept blinking and rubbing my eyes. In 2016 my mom finally took me to the eye doctor with my sister who needed glasses. We went to Costco because they had an eye doctor place. The optometrist tested my vision. When I told her that I had dry eyes she just said recommended Systane ultra eye drops and said just to stop playing games on the computer. She never examined my eye and said that. When I use the recommended eye drops they still didn't work. The next time I visited the eye doctor was in 2017. Again it was an optometrist I was there to get glasses. On the form they made us fill out, I put dry eyes and my symptoms. The optometrist just said to stop playing games and use eye drops again. Which still didn't work. In 2018 I was getting really depressed and lonely so I told my mom that my problem was serious and we got into an argument. She said that she will let me see an eye doctor again if they didn't believe she wouldn't take me again. My mom and sister didn't really care about my eyes. My mom would say that she gets it too sometimes, but its not even comparable my eyes since its temporary and it hurts less. They both said I just lacked confidence and it wasn't a big deal. A couple months later my appointment was ready. My mom had asked a customer, a good eye doctor around the area and she recommended this place called Ophthalmology Associates. My mom said she would take me, but her boyfriend took me instead. I knew she would do that becuase she didn't care about my problem. When the ophthalmologist came in the room, first thing he said was that he doesn't think I have dry eyes because I'm only 13 years old. The ophthalmologist put numbing drops and did a Schirmer's test. After 5 minutes the opthamolgoist went to check and saw that I had 35mm which was higher than normal which is 15. He thought it was reflex tearing and did the test again. Again it was the same result. The ophthalmologist examined my eye and put yellow stuff on my eye lids. He said that he believes that my tear ducts are blocked due to my allergies and said that he will do a test to see, but he changed his mind last minute. Instead he gave me a prescription to get Prednisolone Acetate 1% which was a steroid drop. When I put them on I couldn't tell a difference. For the next couple weeks I didn't see any improvement. One day I decided not to use my drops. My eyes became very watery and as soon as I put the drops on my eyes, I felt a tiny bit of relief. So I knew it works. On January 14th 2019 my rescheduled appointment arrived. I told the ophthalmologist that it helped but little improvement. The Ophthalmologist told me that it wasn't blocked tear ducts and told me why which I don't remember. The Ophthalmologist said that I over produced tears and told me to get Olopatadine Hydrochloride 0.2%. I asked him if some questions. First was how did I get this eye allergy. He responded we don't know, but if your eyes were exposed to something unfamiliar then it will create an allergy. The next was if there was any permanent cure. He said that with allergies there are no permanent cures. It has been 4 weeks since I use the drops and they only help a little bit. I read online that it might take 12 weeks. I also have concerns about my flashes of light that I didn't mention to my ophthalmologist. Whenever I look into the sky I see thousands of eye floaters moving around. When ever I put pressure in my left eye I always the same unique green donut shaped flash of light moving with the same features and everything. Also when I look at something bright and look away I see the shape of the light on a dark flash of light moving. To cope with my eyes throughout the years I used heat pad, Omega-3 fish oil, castor oil, etc. Because of my eyes I can't focus, I get Embarrassment, I get anxious. I got very lonely and got suicidal thoughts. To this day my eyes constantly water and sting my eyes even with using the drops and I see flashes of light that bother me. Please help me determine the problem because I don't think the allergies are the only problem is to why my eyes feel watery, sting, burning, etc. Currently I take anti histamine pills which helps a little and I put one drop of pataday in each eye applying pressure in the corner afterwards.",2,1,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/ari77l/eye_allergy_and_flashes_of_light_please_help/"")",2019-02-16 22:59:51,

OS - I’ve had silicone oil injected and laser about a week  for “2Q PVR C2 rhegmatogeneous retinal detachment, 1-6 o’clock with retinal breaks at 3 and 4. 270 degree retinal tears and holes from 11-6-9 o’clock  and macular detachment. 

OU:  they’ve also done laser retinopexy for multiple retinal breaks, tears and lattice degeneration from 5 over 2-3 o’clock. 

OU PVD

My optometrist had not noted any retinal issues on my last eye exam which would have been in 2017.  She did do a slit lamp + dilated exam. 

My question - I had previously been living a very active lifestyle playing rec hockey (as a goalie if it matters), CrossFit, skiing, scuba diving, multi day hikes etc. 

While I’m quite happy with the results of the surgery thus far my ophthalmologist is insisting that I’ll need to stop most of these activities permanently as they’re too high a risk for repeat detachments.  He believes that I should take up safer activities and exercise like waking and swimming.  

While I can live with giving up a lot of this temporarily, the thought of never being able to do these again is really quite disheartening.   Can anyone offer any insight on what they recommend to patients for a time table to return to more strenuous exercise.

as7j12,Posterior capsular opacification returning multiple times.,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

To begin with, I had congenital cataracts in both eyes, and waited until I was just over 12 years old to get them removed. Approximately three years after the procedures, I had the first occurrence of PCO in both eyes and went in for the YAG laser. However, since then I have had PCO reoccur a total of four times in both eyes, with each time being closer to the last; it's been about exactly one year since my last YAG laser, and the PCO has returned already to my right eye. This will mark the 5th time once I return from overseas.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I can tell, most sources on PCO either straight up say that it only occurs once, or don't mention that it may occur multiple times. My ophthalmologist has said repeatedly that what I'm experiencing is new to him, but he seems content to just keep repeating the YAG laser.

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions are;

1. Is it ""normal"", in any way, for PCO to return this many times?
2. I am currently living abroad until August and don't necessarily want to deal with getting the YAG done in a foreign country (I'm Canadian, living in Japan). Is there any potential complications with allowing the PCO to develop further for another 5 months?

Sometimes he repeatedly poke his eyeballs at different angles (not hard i think), grab his eyeballs and move them around and sometimes even just touch them. I think he also even tried to scratch his eye (the cornea) He even managed to get a finger up his eyelid. 

I am really concerned about his behaviour. This must be very dangerous. The eyes shouldn’t really be directly touched, right? Unless you actually use contact lenses of course.

So i am taking him to see a professional so he can be evaluated. I am just wondering, why does he keep doing this? Can it be related to some sort of vitamin deficiency, mental health or simply eye discomfort.

aswcf0,Fear of acanthamoeba keratitis with contacts,"I've been a contact lens wearer for about 10 years. I like to say that I've thankfully never experienced an infection from the lenses (some dryness here and there though). However, I've recently been having a uncomfortable feeling in one of my eyes - for a little under a month I'd say. Not super painful, little bit sore and kind of like a feeling of being dry, slight pain in the back of the eye - though that could be headache related due to stress). I've noticed the feeling is partially there while wearing the lenses but doesn't go away when the lenses are out.

So I made a doctor appointment and then consulted Dr. Google. Of course I came up with information about acanthamoeba keratitis and am worried about the possibility of having contracted it. I've been quite good about keeping my lenses away from water the past few years (don't shower, swim in them) but mostly because I just didn't want them to get dried out. I'd never heard of acanthamoeba keratitis before and didn't know this could be a risk with lenses.

I'm mostly concerned because I used to rinse my contact case out with tap water before drying it with a tissue, putting in fresh contact solution and dropping my bi-weekly lenses into them. This was years ago, I don't remember exactly how many years, but I learned eventually that you're not supposed to do that and stopped. Again, even here I never learned about acanthamoeba keratitis and thought you just shouldn't cause it's a risk for general bacterial infections. (And yes, I'm looking into dailies from now on to be on the safe side!)

I know there were other instances over the years where I was exposed to water - instances at pools, amusement water parks, the beach, maybe not drying hands completely before inserting/removing the lenses. And it wasn't even on my radar to be worried that the water exposure could cause such a severe disease.

So here's the question - is there any way during this terrible time of not realizing I was not caring for my lenses properly that I could have contracted acanthamoeba keratitis? I don't think there was any recent major water instance in the past weeks that could have caused this current irritation (maybe walking in the rain without an umbrella - is that likely to cause acanthamoeba keratitis?) But could the poor treatment from earlier times have caused the amoeba to get inside the eye? Could it live dormant for years and then strike? Or maybe I'm being paranoid?",1,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/aswcf0/fear_of_acanthamoeba_keratitis_with_contacts/"")",2019-02-20 16:43:25,

I have a question - can cheap laser pointer (red light, expect it to be class 2 &lt;=1mw, unlikely more, but it could point stuff for good hundred meters during night) hurt an eye ?

It was long ago (\~15 years, i was like 8), don't ask how and why, but it had been pointed straight to eyes many times, for seconds and minutes, overall mb 30-60min. Approximately those years my low myopia numbers grew to medium. No black zones in sight, no visible defects of vision, no other big problems as far as i remember.

I was told to do nothing strenuous for a few days but later on during the day, something unfortunate happened to me and I couldn't help but cry. While crying, my eyeball moved up/looked up and I saw a black hole (photopsia?) which is worrying to me because the cause of the retina surgery was seeing these black spots frequently.

I am worried that my crying somehow opened up the hole that was fixed  since the eye procedure was done the same day. Am I fine?

atg2vw,Vision clearer when I tilt my head,"Hi guys,

I have recently had my prescription updated, with new glasses too. I have had to go back to the optometrist to chat about them because my vision seems blurry, it definitely could be clearer, especially text. I also seem to be getting headaches with them. When I tilt my head slightly to my right, like a dog cocking his head, my vision clears up perfectly. I wish I could see this clearly with my head straight. I have explained this to my optometrist and she has told me to wait a month as I should adjust to them. Its been almost a week now and they don't seem to be getting better. I am willing to wait a month as she says but it just seems frustrating so far. It seems my left eye is the most blurry out of the two, if not the main culprit and my right may be fine.

My prescription is as follows, all the info I have unfortunately -
New Prescription: R -0.50 / -2.75 x 100 L -0.25 / -3.00 x 83 Lens index: 1.6
PD: 62
Coatings: anti scratch and anti glare

Old prescription: R -0.50 / -2.50 x 100
L -0.50 / -2.50 x 87
PD: 62
Coatings: anti scratch and anti glare

Is anything obvious at all with this information? Should I wait the month and head back to her if it doesnt improve or go chat to her again sooner? A month just seems like a long time to have headaches and slightly blurry vision, but if i could adjust then that would be great. I feel I am bugging her or going against her expertise.

atkdul,Left eye darkness,"About a month ago I started to get dry eyes and less sleep. Three weeks ago I was on the computer and suddenly felt like I was wearing sunglasses but only on left eye. Also when I closed my left eye I could see a round circle, kind of like a clear round jelly fish.  The day it happens I had pain in the eye with light sensitivity. Sorry English is not my first language so a little hard to describe. I do go on the computer a lot six hours a day due to my line of work.  

Saw my doctor got referred to optometrists and ophthalmologist. I went to the optometrist and retina, macula. Cornea was all normal in left. She said my rt eye had worse vision than left.  Said to get new lense for my glasses which I do not always wear. 

I am male 40  and she said it sounds like a floater. Because where ever I move the round jelly blob that is making my vision in lt darker by 3 shades moves with me.  Sometime I experience pain in the left eye as well but it goes away.

atpuht,Edge of glasses blur," 

Any and all help appreciated, will post this somewhere else if it fits anywhere else better. I saw the new prescription sticky was archived so wasn't sure.

Just went in a week ago to get some new glasses after not having new glasses for 4 years. My vision wasnt TOO bad but small prints were getting harder to see with the old glasses. I have been told about the fishbowl effect where things feel a little slanted and tilted and noticed it right away when I first put them on. The wall in front of my seemed to bulge towards me. While I was working last night I noticed that a part of the table on my left side looked slanted and tilted like a marble would easily run off of it but I know it is perfectly flat. That is not the issue that I am concerned with at the moment though.

My issue is that the way I wear my glasses my eyes sit in the exact middle of the lens and the area in this spot seems to be roughly the same strength as my old prescription, maybe a little clearer. When I look up through the top 25% of the lens, everything seems a LOT clearer and looking through the sides of the bottom of the glasses things get blurry and I can barely read out of those sections of the glasses. Also, the lower I go when looking through the lens, the worse my chromatic aberration seems to get. I noticed these things because I drive for a job and the signs above my head that tell what highway I was getting on and off of seemed to be crystal clear but signs like speed signs and things that were more leveled with my head and the middle of the glasses seemed to be a slight more blurried or like my old glasses. When I kept my head facing the road straight ahead and I would glance in mirrors or look at speedometer or my center console for radio and air controls things got really blurry and if I looked at the heat knob for my car without moving my head, the blue bar seemed a lot higher than the red bar. If I angled myself and looked through the top part of my glasses, the blue and red bars lined up perfectly fine.

I went in to ask the staff if this was normal as well or if maybe something was wrong with the prescription because I have had a wrong prescription the last time I went in 4 years ago. One staff member told me ""that will just take time getting used to"". A second one told me ""the red and blue lines don't match up so I don't see what you are complaining about. You'll never have full sight through the edges of your glasses. It just doesnt work that way, only the direct center in front of the eye is supposed to be clear"" (which confused me as my old glasses never had a change in clear/blurry no matter what edge I looked at and the top part of these is clearer than the center so that seems odd that the bottom would be so much worse). And the third said ""oh, it's because the nose pieces were set too high. that should fix things. If it doesn,t it's because you are using a new lens material."" and it has not changed much. It helped a little but my eyes are still fighting over what to focus on.

As an example, right now my monitor is perfectly level with the center of my eyes and things seem fine, very similar to old prescription. If I tilt my head down as if I were looking at the desk, but keeping looking at the monitor, things get a LOT clearer, if I tilt my head up to look down my nose at the monitor, the text gets extremely blurry, still readable, but not enjoyable by any means at all.

I did read that someone had a similar issue with edges being blurry and had their pupillary distance remeasured and came out a little clearer but not a lot. When I was being fitted with the frames to see which I liked the lady did have me try them on and then put a mark on where the eyes centered and I am wondering if maybe this could cause the problem because maybe I had them sitting on my face differently since they had fake lenses and I was just seeing if they would fit my face to begin with, like if they lowered the central focal point (not even sure if that is a thing) that maybe it'd make the center of the glasses clearer and the lower portion not as blurry if the current lens has the very top part being the clearest.",2,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/atpuht/edge_of_glasses_blur/"")",2019-02-22 17:53:50,

atrdr6,Numerous symptoms,"Been having a bunch of eye problems recently and so far an optometrist and ophthalmologist haven't found anything but have a follow-up appointment soon.

Symptoms are:

\- one day while staring at my computer I suddenly felt dizzy and it felt like my eyes rolled to the back of my head for a second or two, felt normal immediately after though

\- a few days later I started feeling light sensitivity

\- a week later I sudden noticed a bunch of new floaters. I've previously seen one or two little bubbles when I've looked at bright surfaces for a few seconds but now there are between 5-10 little worm-shaped ones, mostly in my right eye. When I quint against a bright surface like a window or the sky I can see maybe 50-100 tiny little bubbles which seem to make up my floaters.

\- maybe a few weeks after that I noticed glare from lights during the day was much harsher, and at night I see often halos around lights (which blinking seems to temporarily fix sometimes)

\- trails (not sure how to describe really) of light at night. For example If I'm looking up and quickly look down at my computer screen, there is a flash of light below the screen for a brief second.

Are there any obvious causes of these symptoms, or things I should make sure I get checked at my next appointment?

Also are these things normal and I'm just noticing them as I'm constantly looking for things, or are they possible symptoms too:

I was given glasses with a slight prescription, I think they said 1x, and went with the best anti-glare glasses offered, which was Crizal lenses. 

While wearing at night, it is making headlights, or any light look like a starburst, or having whiskers come out. I kind of already see lights look like this without glasses, but the glasses make it about 3 times as bad to the point that I cannot even wear them while driving ... which is unfortunate, because that's the only reason I wanted them.

I've communicated this to my doctor and the glasses have been returned twice to check for defects and then they were completely rebuilt by the top guy at wherever they were made. The second time they sounded sure they knew what it was and called it crazing, but having gotten the new glasses back, I still have the same issue as before. I also tried watching a play and couldn't use my glasses because it created a halo around the cast members on stage. 

I do not have keratoconus according to the doctor as I specifically asked about that.

&amp;#x200B;

Age/Sex: 28/Male

Prescription: -9d (left eye) -12d (right eye)

Current Eye Conditions: Bilateral lattice degeneration from 11 to 3 o'clock with 2-3 associated atrophic, pigmented retinal holes. Diagnosed degenerative myopia. Vitreous floaters in both eyes (the right is much worse).

Family History: History of relatively high myopia on my mother's side (I've been unable to find anyone else's actual Rxs). No history of major retinal problems.

Now that that's out of the way, please let me explain my current situation. I've always known that my eyes were worse than most people's, but have never thought twice about it. Because my current employer offers fairly decent health insurance, and because I hadn't gotten new glasses in almost a decade, I decided to get myself checked out and evaluated for a new prescription if needed. During the eye examination two months ago (which, incidentally, happened to be my first ever dilated exam) it was revealed that my high degree of myopia has caused the degenerative changes mentioned above.

&amp;#x200B;

During the actual examination, I wasn't given much of a chance to ask questions. I was only told that I was at risk for some very scary vision affecting complications and to be on the lookout for flashes/new floaters/changes in my vision.

&amp;#x200B;

Because I was given very little information at the time of my diagnoses, I spent the next couple of weeks consulting Dr. Google (bad idea, I know) and discovered just how many vision-threatening conditions I am at risk for. What I've not been able to find are statistics regarding my particular situation. I have no history of medical anxiety, but my eyes have me extremely worried, especially regarding retinal detachments and Myopic Macular Degeneration/CNV.

&amp;#x200B;

I, like most people, am heavily reliant on my eyes to work/function and would like to take every step possible to preserve my vision. Are there any statistics/advice one could point me towards in order to help me feel better about my diagnosis and/or help me take the situation into my own hands?

ausc26,Bad case of eye strain,"Hello everyone, I hope someone can help me! 

For quite some time now I've been suffering from eye strain. My eyes get tired when looking at a screen and I get a headache. It all passes when I stop looking at a screen, sleeping helps even better. 

I've had my eyes checked and I was diagnosed with astigmatism. The glasses I bought help tremendously, but they don't solve my problem. I've tried a bunch of other stuff, like eye drops, the 20/20/20 rule and I've installed flux.

Something is very, very weird though. Once the sun goes down, my issues disappear COMPLETELY. I can stare at a screen for hours (like now) without ant issues whatsoever. 

I've visited three different eye doctors (made an appointment with a fourth), but no one has been able to explain this. The last doctor actually ran all of his tests again after putting on the lights but claimed that he saw no difference in my eyes. 

So you'd think light causes my issues. Only it doesn't really. By that I mean that I'm completely fine with artificial light. So sun light seems to be the culprit? 

At work I am lucky because I work in a room with no natural light. But we'll be moving to a new office with lots of natural light late this year, and I'm really dreading this.

autrsg,Eye strain and a new floater?,"So I've posted over on the Optometry subreddit before about my story on an alternate account, but the short and skinny of it is that I was taking accutane, which had double vision listed as a side effect. Started noticing that, got an emergency trip to the optometrist two weeks ago, and they told me I have a major astigmatism, and that accutane may have caused it.

Anyway, I'm scheduled to head back in for a followup this Friday to get some glasses, since it doesn't seem like it's gotten much better (and I've been due for them for a while anyway), but lately I've been experiencing really bad strain in my right eye, and what seems to be a new floater. I've had floaters forever, but this one seems a lot larger and more aggressive than the tiny lines and dots I'm used to.

It's hard to describe it, but it's basically this large line from a portion of my lower eye that extends to my peripheral vision (like it's curving into it), looking at a white background on a monitor is where it's most noticeable. It also seems to respond to light and turn blue for a few seconds, if for example I go look in the bathroom mirror and turn my light on and off, I can see a slightly large wormy looking line that fades away. Even walking out of my room into the hall, it turns blue temporarily from the light. (And when looking at white backgrounds on my monitor, it does seem to move with my eye.) Sometimes it feels like I'm experiencing it flashing in my eye as well.

I ended up going to the ER because I wasn't sure what it was, and the doctor there took a look at my eyes with a slit lamp and said they looked fine. He went through the explanation of floaters to me, and said that's probably what I have. But I've never experienced one this aggressive before, nor with such bad eyestrain.

Does this sound like a classic floater? And is there anything in particular I should talk to the optometrist about on Friday? I'm really bad at describing my symptoms, so I don't really know how to describe it or what to ask about.

I thought it might be migraine related, since I do suffer from a lot of headaches, and have had migraines/ocular migraines before, but that usually goes away within an hour at most and turns into a migraine. Also, this might be completely unrelated, but I've been having upper tooth pain on the right side of my mouth in my wisdom tooth area for a while now, so I'm wondering if that might be causing eye pain as well.",3,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/autrsg/eye_strain_and_a_new_floater/"")",2019-02-25 18:24:14,

I had a white slightly painful white bump on the lower eyelid margin 10d ago. It discharged into my eye and I woke up the next day with a very inflamed chalazion on the upper eyelid.

I got to an eye doctor who prescribed what I understand to be a neomycin(""fradiomycin"")+methylprednisolone ointment to use 3 times a day.

After a week I got back there and was told that it was healing ok, I should keep using the cream for one extra week.

2 days ago I had some discomfort in the other eye, as is usual before an infection. I woke up with yet another very inflamed chalazion, in the other eye. I've started treating it the very same way.

I have no idea wtf is happening. 

This morning I woke up with yet another whitish spot on the eyelid margin, in the eye that got infected in the first place 10d ago, although this time it's not painful. Even though I'm still using antibiotics in that eye.

auy9lz,Vision gets blurry when focussing on something for a longer duration and during reading," 

When I read longer texts or simply focus on something for a longer time, my vision gets somewhat blurry. This happens within 5-10 seconds. I would compare it to a soft gaze which I also use to skim through texts in order to find words in it or if you slightly cross your eyes. It is only a very minor limitation while reading but it is still there and I don't think this has always been the case.

&amp;#x200B;

* I have 100% eyesight (no real imbalance either where I can see things further away/ closer any better)
* I have good balance
* I do intermittent fasting (good diet and mostly no processed foods)
* Sleep has no impact on it
* I have so so short term memory (If I know something is important then there's no problem and I can also memerize longer numbers)
* I spend a lot of time in front of my Notebook due to my major
* Accomodation works (when I focus on something far away for 30s and then something closer it is instantly sharp)
* My eyes are very light sensitive (always have been)
* Happens inside and outside (also no carbon monoxide problem or something like that)
* I do not have diabetes or any other illness and am decently fit (exercise 3x per Week)

av57w2,Bubbles Converging on Center of Vision in Bright Conditions,"For as long as I can remember I've had a peculiar visual symptom when I'm outside in snow or bright sunlight. I've tried googling it, but everything redirects to floaters, which it doesn't seem to be. 


If you know the old Star Trek Screensaver from Windows, where stars emerge from the edges of a void center, and move outwards in every direction from the center, it's like that, but in reverse. I see what looks like bubbles or shadows of bubbles, which move quickly into the center of my vision but disappear just before they get there, leaving an unobstructed area in the center of my vision. The bubbles start off fairly big, perhaps as big as my fingertip in my vision, and very transparent, and as they speed towards the center they become smaller, and more visible, until they vanish around the center. The effect persists wherever I look, always centered where I'm looking. 


It gets more pronounced the longer I'm outside in the snow or sunlight, and becomes unnoticeable in normal conditions. I remember noticing this when I was 5 or so years old, and at 23 it's exactly the same. If anybody needs any clarifying questions I'll try to respond.

avbp27,My eyes hurt for some unknown reason.,"Hi!

Age: 20

For the past 3 months, my eyes have been acting weirdly. At first, they started to hurt really badly after long periods of being behind a computer, because I had to study for my exams. When the exams were passed, my eyes stopped
hurting, but I got in my one eye around 3 black eye floaters and 5-10 transparent (but big) eye floaters. 

I thought this was serious, so I made an appointment to the person, who prescribes glasses (she also checked my eyes). She told me that floaters usually come with age or with a torn retina. She checked my eyes and said that one eye (that has a lot of floaters) is completely fine, just -0.25 glasses needed, other eye, which doesn't have floaters, is -0.5. She checked my retinas and none of the eyes have torn retinas.
I felt relieved, but also simultaneously annoyed, because I can't get rid of these huge floaters. 

Time went by and as of yesterday, my eyes started to hurt again really badly, but this time I did not even spend that much time behind my computer. Whenever I start to look at a screen, it takes only 10 minutes before my eyes start hurting and dripping tears. Furthermore, by the evening I start blinking very excessively and there's nothing I can do to it. Today I woke up with my eyes hurting and also with a headache (at the back of my head). I am helpless and I don't know, what to do. 

PS: it appears that more floaters have appeared, this time also to the eye that previously did not have any floaters flying in it

I've been to my eye dr twice who just tells me the same thing. No inflammation in your eye,but when he flips my eyelid over, he sees inflammation and bumpy spots. 

My dad was looking at my eye last night and said your eyelid is puffier than the other one. It isn't red though. It just feels very inflamed.

For a month, since about mid-January, I have been dealing with some sort of eye infection in my left eye. No symptoms at all in my right. It started out as a watery eye, and after a week my eye began producing yellowish mucus. I’ve had no redness in my eye at all, it doesn’t appear like typical pinkeye. 

I made an appointment with my eye doctor, who was adamant that he saw no signs of infection. He prescribed me allergy drops (Alaway) and lubricant drops (Refresh), and also wrote me a script for Tobradex. He made it very clear that he felt the Tobradex was entirely unnecessary, but he said he could tell I was concerned so he would write the script anyway.

Since he seemed so certain it was allergies (and I had just moved to a new place with a cat and I do have occasional allergies), I treated it that way. I used the allergy and lubricant drops and took Claritin every morning. There was no change at all, and my eye continued oozing. I filled the Tobradex script. A week of Tobradex cleared things up and I was fine for about a week after stopping the drops.

A week later, the yellowish mucus came back. The eye doctor told me to try the Tobradex again for a few more days. No change. I spent that weekend in Colorado, with no cat and no pollen, just snow, and the oozing continued.

I called my eye doctor again, who said if the allergy drops and the Tobradex didn’t clear it up, they had to refer me to someone else. I saw a cornea specialist, who examined me and said he also didn’t see any signs of infection. I showed him a photo of my eye from when I woke up that morning, crusted shut with greenish yellow mucus, and then he gave me Besivance drops. 

I’m on day four of the Besivance drops, and nothing is better. I’m still mopping my eye throughout the day, still producing copious amounts of watery fluid and globs of mucus. I’m ready to scoop my eye out with a melon baller. I haven’t been able to see properly for over a month. 

At the end of October, I had some hardware removed from a previous jaw surgery. Some plates and screws were removed from the area around my nose and beneath my eye. Both my jaw surgeon and my eye doctors seem to think this is unrelated as my eye issues didn’t start until mid-January, but I’m concerned regardless.

Anyway, this past Thursday went to another doctor and got a new prescription, but no matter what they tried they couldn’t correct the vision in my right eye. She said everything looked ok, and all the tests they done looked good too. Field of vision is perfectly fine. 

Of course, this has me concerned, but just experimenting, I noticed something really weird. Looking straight ahead, the vision in the right eye is a touch blurry, however if I turn my head left or right, it clears up just fine. Unable to get back up with my doctor before the weekend, just wondering what can cause that?  No pain, headaches, etc. I do work in pest control, so some pyrethrim based products have gotten into it from time to time. And I have had a couple bouts with Bell’s palsy over the last 13 years, but not severe, no drooping in my face or anything. 

Any help or advice would be appreciated, thanks! ",1,1,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/awjd1g/weird_issue_with_right_eye/"")",2019-03-02 08:25:41,
awqpku,"Progressing Abnormal eye movements, docs can't figure out","Age: 32

Gender: Male

Weight: 155

Height: 6'0""

Diagnosis: Abnormal eye movement

I've seen three neuro ophthalmologists, and one neurologist (all Colorado) and none can figure it out so far.

Basically, when looking straight ahead, and I tilt my head down (keeping eyes on same object), one of my eyes starts moving up (creating double vision).

It's now also doing something similar when turning my head to the right, except one eye/image moves downwards.

I had a brain MRI a year ago which came back normal.

One of the neuro ophthalmologists diagnosed me with myasthenia gravis (w/ no antibodies), but the others did not agree.

These eye problems seem to have started 2-3 years ago.

I've also been having some impulse anger/anxiety/fight or flight at irrelevant times (last month or so), as well brain fog/memory issues (last 5-6 years especially)

The only thing I can think of is genetics+methylation cycle: - CBS C699T is +/+ (meaning excess ammonia/difficulty removing it [or something like that], so possibly brain damage from excess ammonia?) And about 3 years ago I started supplementing w/ methylb12/methylfolate. Probably totally irrelevant, but who knows.

ax1hou,"Vision constantly fluctuating, what to do?","My vision is constantly fluctuating, quite significantly. Some days I see terribly, everything is blurry and colours are faded out, other days I see quite well, but on average I’d say my vision is poor. Eye drops help a tiny bit, for maybe a half hour to an hour, but then things just go back to where they are. If I had to guess, I’d say the drops might add 0.25 diopters or close to it.

Now, I have had multiple prescriptions over the last 5 years, but the prescriptions are all over the place and I don’t really trust them anymore. For example, using only my right eye but it is the same thing in the other eye:

Script/year 1: -0.5, with 0.75 astigmatism.
Script/year 2: -1.25, with 0.5 astigmatism
Script/year 3: Plano, with 0.5 astigmatism
Script/year 4: -1.00, with 0.25 astigmatism
Script/year 5: -0.5, with 0.5 astigmatism

Today, the day after the latest prescription, my eye sight is excellent, and I would bet if I returned for another exam, my prescription would be lower than it was yesterday, since yesterday before the exam my vision was mediocre. It is always the same too, after the dilation drops have worn out, my vision is fantastic and then things start to slowly drift away over the course of days to weeks. Can someone explain what might be going on and why the prescriptions as constantly changing so much, from a low of Plano to a high of -1.25 diopters? All the optometrists are always the same, they listen to my issues, say it is just my prescription is wrong and I need a new one which will fix the issue, but it never does.

ax6sdr,Circle in my vision - one eye,"Since the start of the year, there's been this circle in my vision.  It's not a floater since it doesn't move the same way as my floaters do.   It's like someone took a photo with a flash, you know the light stays in your vision for a bit, but it's only in my right eye and it's been there for two months.  I also noticed that I'm more sensitive to light.  Also, contrasting light tones seem like they'll stay in my vision longer than normally, meaning if I looks a a screen then look away and blink my eyes, I can still see it.  That seemed to always happen but it seems to be more vivid and more easily triggered.

Eye Rx dilated my pupils and did some tests but said my eye looks fine.  Did a field test and he said there were some blind-ish spots and sent me to a specialist but that's not till August. Rx said it could be a migraine and they don't necessarily cause pain.  

Something that seemed to happen around the same time was one of my fingers started to tingle on the same day I noticed this.

It tends to get less swollen as the day goes on, but it is still noticeable and the eye gives me a bit of pain/discomfort, especially if I apply any pressure to it. Today, I pulled my eyelid out and saw that there is a small white bump on the inside, to the side of my eye, which looks like a whitehead.

My brain pretty much ignores this eye - I can see shapes and outlines out of it but not much else. My left eye however has near perfect vision so I’ve always been okay. I wear glasses for driving and that’s it - other than that I can get about life.

The surgery was performed on my left eye muscles, to correct the right eyes laziness. In terms of cosmetically, it’s perfect, it’s straight.

In terms of vision, I’m very concerned. My left eye is completely blurry - considering I rely on this eye for vision I’m left barely able to see. I keep hoping it will improve, as my eye did get infected and I had to go A&amp;E, and I was given antibiotics a week after surgery, but it’s now almost better in terms of redness and my sight is not coming back.

With my glasses, it’s much improved, and I can go about my daily life, but without (which I’m used to, I only wear for driving usually) I can’t do anything. Everything is a huge blur.

axt2hi,Lifelong Vision-based Weirdisms.,"(This might get long, apologies.)

So, when I was a kid (5ish?) I had an eye test. My left eye was utterly useless. Optician gave me glasses, after about a year they didn't help. No mention of patches or ""lazy eye""/amblyopia. Instead they said it was something to do with my optic nerve. I just sort of accepted it and relied on my right eye (it's 20/20). All's well. (I stopped wearing the glasses after the optician said they had made 0 difference). 

Except I came across another story on Reddit about someone with a lazy eye and it sparked a bit of an interest. I briefly thought, ""I wonder if it was just that and I didn't get treated properly"". So I dug around for symptoms and everything that's in any way descriptive mentions ""blurred vision"", except the vision I have in my left eye isn't blurred at all. It's sharp as a tack, just that somehow my brain can't quite understand what it's seeing (this particular bit sounds pretty similar to lazy eye descriptions but it's a little stranger). 

I see a clear image. If I focus long enough I can get past the weird shit and make perfect sense of what I'm reading. Except overlaid on top of my vision is what I can only describe as DeepDream-esque colours and swirls. Very faint, to the point that I only recognised them as being similar to DeepDream today (I have never really paid much attention to my left eye, as I say, just relying on the right) but still there. Particularly noticeable if I look at something blank/textureless, because then it stands out over the actual vision. At first I thought this was maybe something to do with blood flow in my covered eye (I've read about how blood flow is what can cause swirly patterns when you press on an eye) but after completely sealing all light out without applying pressure to my right eye, they're still there, and focusing my left eye is what draws my attention to it. 

In addition to that, I have what appears to be colour fringing/chromatic aberration on any object near a strong light source - purplish-blue along the top and greenish down either side (strongest on the lit side). Again this only happens with my left eye, and changes based on me attempting to focus at different depths using it. 

It's also worth mentioning that I don't have a squint or apparent astigmatism in that eye - underneath the weird swirly filter things seem to be in perfect focus at any distance. I also have no obvious issues with depth perception (especially compared to having either eye closed), so even though I rely on my right eye for conscious vision I must still be using my left somehow. 

None of this sounds like anything I've been able to find through Googling, thankfully I live in Scotland where free eye tests are a thing but I feel they might not be able to delve into what's actually happening other than ""Your left eye doesn't work but we won't give you glasses"" (as occurred at my last eye test ~6 years ago) so I'm mainly here out of curiosity, in case anyone has experienced or treated something similar. 

As a final note, I'm also autistic and suffer from sensory processing issues. When overwhelmed, visual information can be difficult to make sense of. The thing in my left eye though is like nothing I've ever seen (heh) before.

I have posted on this subreddit before, but it was incredibly long and I didn't explain enough so I deleted it. 

Ever since I was born I noticed that whenever I applied pressure to my eyes, I see many unique shapes. Now I know that it is called phosphenes. In November of 2014 I went to school and noticed that I had sensitivity to light. I also noticed that wind irritated my eyes a lot. I felt my eyes stinging, burning, watering, discomfort. I was so confused so I didn't tell anyone even though it was very painful and impacted my life greatly. I researched my problem in 2015 and the main answer was dry eyes. I tried eye drops, castor oil, warm compress, omega-3 fish oil, massages, anything that I found online. I finally asked my mom to take me to the eye doctor (optometrist).
I went to 2 and they both said to stop using the computer and use eye drops even though they didn't even check my eyes only tested my vision. The drops didn't work so I coped with it. In 2018 I told my mom that my eyes are a huge problem and to take me to the eye doctor. My mom didn't believe me because the optometrist said the same thing. But I begged her to because it was a huge issue and it was urgent. A couple months later I went to an ophthalmologist. At first the ophthalmologist said that he doesn't think I have dry eyes because of my age. He did a Schirmer's test and I got 35mm. He thought it was reflex tearing so he did it again with the same result. After that he examined my eyes thoroughly and said that I might have blocked tear ducts due to allergies. He was going to perform a little surgery to see if I had blocked tear ducts, but canceled last minute. Instead he prescribed me with Prednisolone. After a couple weeks I went back for the checkup and told him that ""I only noticed that it helped when my eyes were really watery and if I put drops. it helps very slightly besides that I didn't notice any improvement instilling 3 drops per day."" He examined my eyes and said to me that my eyes were over producing tears because of my allergies. I asked him more questions. Is there a permanent cure? ""With allergies there are no permanent cures only temporary measures.""
How did I get eye allergies? "" Something that the eyes weren't used too, suddenly appeared and the eyes over reacted to it and it's permanent."" He told me that he was positive that Olopatadine was going to help me. It has been 7 weeks since the checkup. Each morning I instill one drop of Olopatadine Hydrochloride Ophthalmic Solution 0.2% in each eye, but I still don't notice any improvement. I also take 2 tablets of allergy relief to cope with it. Before I can continue I want to explain my other problems. When I was a child I got flashes of light and floaters, but didn’t really notice or care. Now there getting more severe. I look at some light and look away and a flash appears moving. I look into the sky and the only thing I see is moving white cobwebs thousands of them. I see millions of very faint small circles. When I apply pressure to the same spot on my eye I see the same big green flash of light with everything exactly the same as before moving across my eyes. In the dark I see flashes to without light. I also get faint black curtains on my eyes that are starting to get annoying. I recently researched this problem and I think I might have a detached retina. I think I might have gotten the eye allergy from not closing my eyes when I take a shower with shampoo btw. He didn’t tell me what I have, but I think that I have chronic allergic conjunctivitis. The past three days of March 6, 2019 has been hell. I go to school and every second my eyes get irritated and then I have to blink or rub my eyes because it gets watery, I don’t know why I think my eyes are trying to drain the Olopatadine or something. I’m afraid of asking my mom to see the eye doctor again because she won’t believe me and say stop using the computer even though I blink like 30 times per minute.

For the past few months, my eyes have been slightly irritated (barely noticeably bloodshot, pinkish) and around bright lights at night I'm seeing halos and glare.

I don't think it's astigmatism as I have 20/15 or better acuity in both eyes and didn't have astigmatism when I went to the opto a few years ago. I'm young so probably not a cataract. I've been doing hot compresses (Seem to make my eyes more irritated) and artificial tears for a bit over a week now, hasn't improved. Is this likely a permanent thing?

aybh8i,Am I suffering from Digital Eye Strain or is it something else? Please help.,"I'm writting this because I'm in a pretty desperate situation and it's starting to look like Reddit is my last hope. Basically I've had a computer ever since I was a kid(I'm now 26) and never had any eye related problems before(other than having to get glasses), no matter how much time I spent in front of it. So it all started around mid-October 2018,on this particular day when I spent almost the whole day being in front of the computer. I did take short breaks every now and then though. Not sure exactly how many hours had passed(I'm guessing around 12?) when all of the sudden I felt this strong stinging pain and I'm not sure if I felt it in both of my eyes or just in the left one. I'm pretty sure this was caused by the fact that sometimes I forget to blink as much as I should if I focus on a certain task. I looked in the mirror and my eyes look pretty red and tired so I turned off my computer and went to sleep.

Ever since that day, I can no longer sit in front of the computer for long periods of time like I used to even though I'm always forcing myself to blink more. In fact, I can only do 1 hour computer sessions at a time before I feel like I need to take a long break from it (also around 1 hour), anything longer than 1 hour in front of the computer screen and my eyes will either get tired, dry or bloodshot. Sometimes I would even feel all of those symptoms at once which is a nightmare to deal with since it's happening every single day since then. Whenever my eyes feel dry and/or tired and I look in the mirror, the surface of my eyes actually looks wet! Which is very confusing and I'm not sure what's happening with my eyes. How could they feel dry if they are actually wet?
 
When my eyes get bloodshot, I often start to feel stinging pain in the area that is red. If I take my eyes off the computer or TV or sometimes even the phone, all the pain and dryness/tiredness slowly starts to go away during the 1 hour break that I usually take. I also started seeing [eye floaters](https://media.giphy.com/media/mYhIQzPpY17xe/giphy.gif) pretty regularly when I look at something bright like the sky for example, which is worrying me a lot.
 
I also want to mention that I've always kept a considerable distance between my eyes and the computer screen, about an arm's length or 60 cm which seems to be more than enough from what I've read and I'm always getting at least 8 hours of sleep per night so I can’t tell what the problem is.

**What I've tried so far**:

**1**) Visited an expensive eye doctor that prescribed me some regular eyedrops called Augen Tropfen. Used them for a month but didn't do much for me.

**2**) Visited another expensive eye doctor that prescribed me Thealoz duo eyedrops along with Artelac Nighttime Gel. Still taking them to this day but I feel little to no improvement.There are times when I feel like the eyedrops help a little but to be honest most of the time I feel like they don’t do much.

**3**) Visited a 3rd eye doctor. A different one. He couldn't figure out what was wrong with my eyes and said I'm fine. I'm obviously not. At this point I'm not planning to go back to another doctor, I'm spending too much money and getting nothing in return. 

**4**) I've set the contrast and brightness of my monitor to 0. As low as it gets. My eyes still feel the same symptoms after each 1 hour computer session (more or less). If I were to set the contrast and brightness values back to what they were before I would last less time in front of the computer. Around 30 mins.

**5**) Tried staring at the monitor with my glasses. No difference. (And yes the prescription for my glasses is correct as it was confirmed by both doctors but I do not wear them at the computer anyway since I’m nearsighted and see perfectly fine at a short distance).

**6**) Bought a pair of special computer glasses called Gunnar that are supposed to block the harmful blue light. No difference.

**7**) Tried installing a program called f.lux that's also supposed to block the harmful blue light. No difference.

**8**) Took a 2 week long break from the computer. As soon as I started using it again all the symptoms came back.

This is a very annoying situation to be in and I can't even go to work because of it. I'm feeling pretty hopeless so any advice coming from any of you will be greatly appreciated.

**EDIT 03/03/2019**: I've been using hot compresses over my eyes for almost a month. My eyes no longer feel like they are getting dry nowadays. However, they still get bloodshot and sting a lot after approximately an hour of PC/TV/PHONE use. (sometimes even less than that..)

**EDIT 03/05/2019**: My eyes also get irritated when I'm outside and it's windy. Also, for whatever reason, I can no longer see as sharp as I used to with my right eye, whether I'm wearing my glasses or not. For example, as I'm writting this, I tried closing one eye at a time and noticed that the text is a bit blurry when looking at it with my right eye. Can't tell if my right eye has an issue focusing on objects or is just seeing blurry if that makes any sense. Couldn't tell any of my doctors about this because it only started happening recently.

**EDIT 03/07/2019**: The lacrimal caruncle from my left eye has been looking slighty red and inflammed for a few days now. Also hurts a bit from time to time. My left eye also happens to be the one that stings the most when using digital devices.",2,13,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/aybh8i/am_i_suffering_from_digital_eye_strain_or_is_it/"")",2019-03-07 03:08:30,
aydv52,Choosing an eye doctor after LASIK and how often do I need to go after the first year?,"I had Epi-LASIK about 11 years ago and in my mid 30's now. I've moved to a new city and haven't had a checkup in a few years. I was wondering should I continue to get checkups at places that offer LASIK since they probably see the most LASIK patients or just go to a general opthalmologist (or optometrist)? 

For background: other than the LASIK I've had a few minor concerns that my optometrist told me to keep an eye on (in my teenage years before the lasik). One was thin retina spots that I saw a retina specialist for but said wasn't worrisome so I stopped going after a few years, a large spot on the white of my eye (hasn't grown for a decade), and some extra blood vessel growth from when I wore contacts. I also have some permanent floaters. I've have dry eyes in the morning when I first wake up since the Epi-LASIK but overall not too bad. One eye still has perfect vision while the other has drifted slightly but not enough to warrant correctives yet. 

My LASIK place didn't really tell me what my care plan should be after the last 1 year checkup (which was with their optometrist). With the above background do I see a general opthalmologist every year for a checkup? Or just an optometrist? And for either should it be at a LASIK specific place or is anywhere fine? Also, I live in Philadelphia and I'm curious about the pros/cons of going to someone at a big hospital like Will's (which I think is the big eye hospital here, though they don't do LASIK which goes back to my original question if that is important or not) or an independent clinic.

az22kg,Not sure if contact lens is still there,"I always try to be careful and precise when handling my contact lenses. Yesterday i removed my contact lenses from my eyes, but the weird thing is that it feels like i still have a contact lens on my left eye. Like a foreign body sensation when i blink or move my eye. 

I use daily disposable contact lenses, and i know that these containers may contain more than one contact lens, but this rarely never happens. 

So i tried everything. I tried putting some rewetting drops and saline solution in my eye, then gently massaging the eyelid to see if something would move. I was told that you can use your glasses to tell if the contact lens is still there, but i could see fine with glasses. Lastly, i examined my eyes in the mirror with external light to see if the contact was there. I saw a kind of blue tint around my iris, but this may be something else. I know that my contact lens has a blue visibility tint, so i would know if it was there, but still, this didn’t look like it.

So after checking my eyes multiple times, i decided to sleep. The next day the foreign body sensation was gone. Should i go get my eyes checked or not. Its not like the visibility tint on my contact lens will go away, right?

azbdcm,'Shadow' effect in vision while reading + text ghosting/halo,"Hi,

A few years ago I started getting a 'shadowy' effect while reading (particularly on computer screens), the best way I can  describe it is the sensation you get if you stare at a lightbulb and then at a white wall, it's like that, but all of the time. There's also a slight halo / ghosting outline around text. I work in software development, which is about 80% reading text, so this has been quite problematic.

When it started I went to an optometrist who did a few tests and said I have accommodation/tracking/convergence issues, describing it as ""the eyes as a 50 year old"", I'm only 25 and have a relatively mild prescription  (-1.00x-0.75x170 axis astigmatism left, -1.25 right). They didn't see any physical eye disease but referred me to the eye unit at the hospital. 

I saw a lady at the hospital (Ophthalmologist?) a couple of times, each time she gave me eye exercises (for accommodation + convergence insufficiency) to do for a few weeks and followed up with another test. The eye exercises didn't seem to do much, every time she observed my eyes while reading she commented she could still visibly see them having abnormal movement when reading. At this point she didn't know what else to try, so referred me on to a more senior consultant. 

The appointment with the consultant lasted about 2 minutes, he didn't even look in my eyes, he'd read on my records that I suffer from depression and had already decided it was all in my head... I questioned what it might have been the other people saw, but he just shrugged, and that was about it, he told me to stop wasting their time. I wasn't in a great place then, and the way he treated me put me off seeking any further help.

There's a few things that have an effect on the problem, if I wear contact lenses it seems to be worse (glasses have no effect). Also, if I read in complete darkness it's *much* less of an issue, but even the tiniest amount of daylight starts causing problems.  

Is this likely to be in my head, despite other people seeing issues... or has anyone heard of a condition that causes symptoms similar to this? Thanks in advance.

azkzae,Bad case of eye strain during the day,"Hello everyone, I hope someone can help me! 

For quite some years now I've been suffering from eye strain when staring at a screen (reading a book or driving are no problem). My eyes get tired when looking at a screen and I get a headache. It all passes when I stop looking at a screen for a while and my eyes can rest, sleeping helps even better. 

My symptoms have been fluctuating. From very bad (headaches after a few minutes of staring at a screen) to almost nonexistant (the past yeard and a half or so). Lately the symptoms have been flaring up again.

I've had my eyes checked and I was diagnosed with astigmatism. The glasses I bought help tremendously, but they don't solve my problem. I've visited an eye doctor last summer and she prescribed new glasses because my astigmatism got sligtly worse.

I've tried a bunch of other stuff like eye drops, the 20/20/20 rule and I've installed flux on my computer and smartphone. All with very limited success.

Something is very, very weird though. I only experience these headaches during the day. Once the sun goes down, my issues disappear COMPLETELY. I can stare at a screen for hours (like now) without any issues whatsoever. This also means artificial lightning doesn't cause any issues for my eyes (my room is lit right now).

I've visited three different eye doctors (going to a new one tomorrow), but no one has been able to explain this. The last doctor actually ran all of his tests again after putting on the lights but claimed that he saw no difference in my eyes. Maybe because his room had no windows and all the lightning was artificial?

So sun light seems to be the culprit? It has been very sunny for the past few weeks here, so maybe that's why my symptoms have reappeared. 

At work I am lucky because I work in a room with no natural light. But we'll be moving to a new office with lots of big windows late this year, and I'm really dreading this. For those sugesting f.lux is the solution because it only kicks in at sunset, I don't have f.lux installed at work and my eyes are fine there.

So can anyone actually explain this? I'm happy to answer any questions.

aznw1w,Curious Question About Reading at Night,"Long story short, pretty much my whole life, I have trouble going to sleep at night. I take extremely good care of myself, I exercise regularly, eat meticulously healthy, and try to ensure I get at least 8 hours every night, despite how hard it is for me to doze off at night, so it's confounding why I have this problem. I'd have to lay in bed at the bare minimum of 45 minutes tossing around before I'm actually asleep. 

However, one thing that does help me go to sleep faster is the act of reading while laying in bed. There reaches a point where I start to nod off, then I simply put away my device and go to sleep. From what I understand, this contradicts the fact that being exposed to light at night will not only make it harder to sleep, but worsen the quality of sleep. I try to mitigate this as best as possible by using whatever technology is available, and there are two forms: I can read on a kindle paperwhite, which is an e-ink reader that is backlit(?) that mimics reading a book with a lamp shone OVER it (as how it's usually described), or I can read on my smartphone with the twilight app, with maximum filtering of blue light, which is 1200K, but of course the led lights blare right into my eyes. Of course, both devices are at lowest brightness settings possible.

My question is, which one would be ""better"" for my eyes, if I HAD to use one of the devices to help me fall asleep in a completely dark room, device 5-6 inches away from the face?

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a problem over the past two months or so with my vision. My symptoms include:

\- Blurred/double vision

\- Dry/red eyes

\- Sometimes I experience a weird feeling almost like my depth perception isn't working properly

\- Tracers, curtains

\- Moderate photosensitivity

\- Eyes constantly losing focus

\- When I stare at screens with text in some places and big blank spaces in others (for instance, right now on Reddit the text entry box is in the middle and there are blank grey panels to the side) the blank spaces seem to have a ""fuzz"" over them almost like I'm seeing black and white dots in the blank spaces all the time. This also happens when I'm not on a screen and I'm looking at, for instance, a painted wall.

&amp;#x200B;

I had an old-ish prescription with some scratched lenses, so I figured this may be the problem. I saw my optometrist who got me fixed up with a new prescription as of a couple weeks ago. They said that my vision should adjust to the correct prescription over the next few days and my symptoms would go away.

&amp;#x200B;

After about a week with the new glasses, I feel like my vision has worsened if anything. These problems seem to be especially bad first thing in the morning and before bed at night.

&amp;#x200B;

I work on a computer 10 hours a day and have a pretty heavy gaming habit outside of work as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I paid for all the optional tests the optometrist had available (blowing air at your eyes, peripheral vision test, photographing and checking my optic nerve) and he said all looks normal. I asked for an ophthalmology referral but the optometrist turned me down.  I was given some eye drops and sent away.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'm feeling pretty desperate due to both my work and my favourite hobby relying pretty heavily on my sight being on the up-and-up.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I call my optometrist back and lean more heavily for an ophthalmology referral, or is there anything else I can do in the meantime? I saw the sticky about warm compresses and I'm going to start trying that immediately.

b04bav,Vision clearer when tilting glasses,"Hi everyone,

I posted a little while back about how my vision is clearer when I tilt my head with my new glasses; I realised after a few people responded that it also clears up when I tilt the glasses themselves, making it seem like an issue with the axis of my prescription.

My prescription changes are as follows (the tilting thing doesn't happen noticeably with my old glasses):
Old prescription: R -0.50 / -2.50 x 100
L -0.50 / -2.50 x 87
PD: 62
Coatings: anti scratch and anti glare

New Prescription: R -0.50 / -2.75 x 100
L -0.25 / -3.00 x 83 Lens index: 1.6
PD: 62
Coatings: anti scratch and anti glare

I have been wearing them for about a month, my optician previously told me (after about a week of wearing them) to return to her after a month if I'm still having issues as she thinks it is an adjustment thing.

Close to a month later today I returned and got retested, my prescription changes now will be as follows:
Changes only to right eye -
-0.50 / 3.00 x 100

She said the tilting could have been giving me a cyl boost clearing up my vision. The thing is though it is more noticeable in my left eye, my right eye maybe slightly clears up when I tilt but it is mainly my left.
I asked her about the axis change from my old to my new prescription, and she said the original time and today's retest she both got 83 so the axis is correct now and if I was to go back then it would be blurry.

Its also worth noting she told me I have better than 20/20 vision with the glasses as they are now so it's not even worth changing the right eye, but I asked to do so anyway as the slight blurriness is annoying (I play video games with them tilted sometimes to clear up the vision so I can see fine details).

Am I just being fussy?
I don't understand why the tilting doesn't work on my old glasses, it seems to get blurrier if I do it with them as if the axis is correct there?

Is it time to get a second opinion or just suck it up and try forget?

b0n7wy,Cloudy film on left eye comes and goes? Worry? Diagnosed w/ Stargardt/retinal dystrophy,"Hey so the last week I have started having a cloudy film type of vision only left eye. It comes and goes but lasts a few hours each time. I have tried eye drops and resting my eyes but it doesn’t help. Is this something I should worry about or is it just another thing to deal with while I lose my vision? 
I also have curtains (lost 47% of peripheral vision), floaters, blurred vision, and flashing dots, dark dots, double vision (comes and goes) but have been told not to worry about any of them as they are all just something to deal with as my condition progresses. 

Everything so far has been both eyes but this is only on my left. (But left has always been worse than the right) 30yr &amp; female if that matters. Both diagnosis of Stargardt and retinal dystrophy were made within the last months due to vision deteriorating quickly.

The eye pain usually goes away when I go off work. I also had photosensitivity for a few days which however went away.

However today i suddenly had two episodes of flashes in my eyes. It only lasted a few seconds however this has made me question whether there might still be something wrong with my eyes although I went to the optometrist twice and to the eye doctor once.

I see my optometrist 1-2x yearly. I do like him and I feel like he gives thorough explanations of what's going on. I get a visual field test and OCT every time I see him. I am extremely nearsighted and my retinas are kind of stretched d/t this. I also once had an issue with severe allergies to the point my eyes were recognizing its own proteins as foreign and wound up with white congealed proteins sticking to my eyeballs and I had to take steroid drops (that's the way I remember it being explained). 

Lately my left eye has been a tiny bit blurrier than usual. He found that my ocular disc is swollen (papilledema) and more stretched than usual. He also said my vision is usually pretty symetrical but it's not so much right now. 

Then he asked me if I have been having headaches, neck stiffness, etc. I have had some neck stiffness for over a month now, and I have been cracking my back and neck A LOT more than usual. When I crack my neck I get a lot of pops out of it, and I do it very frequently during the day because I feel an urge to. If I cannot get a crack out of my neck when I have the urge I feel claustrophobic and go at it more aggressively. 

He said that increased spinal pressure can be a reason for the papilledema. I am going back in a week and he will check if it has changed at all. Should he have told me to go to the hospital or recommended me to an ophthamologist at this point or is it safe to wait?

So at first I noticed I was seeing floaters, but I think I've had those for a while. But recently, about 5 days ago, I've noticed I've been seeing occasional flashes (I think?) . Heres the thing: I feel like I see it more when theres a lot of light in a room compared to when there's no light in a room. I try standing in the bathroom with the lights off(which has no windows and leave my eyes open and I cannot really notice (what I think are flashes) it too much.

So, worrying, I go to the ER (3 days ago). They tell me I'm fine since I'm not seeing any black veils or curtains in my vision and that I should see an ophthalmologist, and they send me home. Currently, I still do not see any loss of peripheral vision or have the ""black curtain effect.""

Yesterday, I saw an optometrist since I had already booked the appointment earlier and figured that would be better than waiting for an ophthalmologist in the mean time. I get pictures of my retina taken and have a dilated eye exam. The optometrist says there is no retinal detachment, after looking at the retinal pictures as well as doing a physical eye exam (using a bright light and using another lens to look at my dilated eyes) and doesn't refer me to any ophthalmologist. I'm assuming this means they think I'm fine but I'm still worried since I still see floaters and occasional flashes.

Attached is the picture of my retina in one of my eyes. My other eye looks pretty much the same. I noticed a sort of white-oval near my (fovea?), in the middle near the darker circle in the middle of the picture. I don't think the optometrist could have missed that, but I keep looking at it thinking it's something serious that they didn't mention.

I realize that I'm at a higher risk for retinal detachment, but after seeing the optometrist and saying them saying I'm fine, I'm still worried since I still see floaters and maybe flashes. My eyes also seem to be very sensitive to light today. Is this just my anxiety or should I get another opinion? This has been starting to affect my daily life because this is all I think about and I do not want to lose my vision.

TLDR; Went to the optometrist for floaters (and what I think are flashes), after a dilated eye exam, they say I am fine. I am still worried since I still see floaters and (I think?) flashes. No change in peripheral vision or any black curtain. Is this just my anxiety or should I get another eye exam (if so, how urgent do you think this is?)

b375m4,Chronic eye inflammation issue. Haven't gotten the answers I've needed from several doctors," 

A couple years ago my eyes started itching like crazy. I thought I  developed allergies, but it was during the winter. It just wouldn't go  away no matter what I did or if I used allergy medicine or drops. So I  finally saw an opthamologist. He diagnosed me with conjunctivitis. My  lower and upper eyelids were incredibly inflamed underneath the  eyelids(need to pull them back to see it, they're almost always beet red  and are super itchy and ooze. It affects my sleep and my vision.  I was  given steroid drops to take care of it. I used them for a couple weeks  and tapered off. It went away. Then a week or so later it came back. And  this has basically been going on since. The drops get it down to about  90% cleared up, but the inflammation won't fully go away. We've tried  the weakest of drops to the strongest. He doesn't want to keep me on  them long because of complications that can develop.  


I've  tried probably upwards of 20 different eye drops, ointments, etc from  allergy to steroid, to antibiotic over the years. I've seen multiple eye  doctors(some top rated at highly regarded hospitals). Everything I've  been prescribed doesn't work.

I  have Crohn's Disease and chronic eczema. So both I and my doctors have  wondered if I have some sort of other inflammatory issue that is now  affecting my eyes. However, my doctors all think it's some type of  allergy irritating my eyes. They all say these type of symptoms almost  always indicate allergies. I've seen an allergist. I did the skin prick  test and consulted with him. He didn't think my issues were allergy  related, he thinks it's inflammatory. So I saw a rheumatologist.   
The  rheumatologist doesn't think it's inflammatory or related to my eczema  or Crohn's. Usually Crohn's people have internal eye inflammation. Mine  is underneath the eyelids, not the actual eyeball, though I did have  some on the outside of the eyeball. I consulted with my gastro doctor.  He agreed, this is not related to my Crohn's.  


I've  tried air purifiers, new detergents, stay away from thinks that I'm  allergic to. Nothing has worked. The inflammation just won't go away,  and the only thing that works is steroid drops, but my doctors don't  want me to stay on them because of glaucoma and cataracts risk.

So  I just don't know what is causing it. All my doctors are stumped. The  rheumatolgist and gastro doctor don't think it's inflammatory because  people like me typically get internal inflammation of the eye and I  don't have that. The allergist thought it was not allergy related, but I  only got a skin prick test for basic allergens. All the eye doctors  I've seen said they can't rule out some rare systemic inflammatory  related issue, but they said in all their years practicing, my eyes  share common symptoms with people who suffer allergies.

My  eyes itch all the time. So so badly. Artificial tears only give a short  period of relief. All I'm left to do is go see more doctors, I guess.  Figured I'd ask if anyone had any advice.

I hadnt see black spots since, until today. So I wore my glasses in case they would make them go away but they didnt.

It lasted for about 40 mins again until it went away.

I could tell text was starting to look weird, and decided one day at work to just close one eye vs another and saw that things looked a bit fuzzy in the right eye. I couldn't explain it (and my background involves studying optics).

So I took one of those online eye exams and was fine for everything except astigmatism. But predominantly in the right eye. The left eye seems fine.

I went to the optometrist and he gave me the same info.

This didn't worry me too much because I knew that astigmatism could be corrected and so my headaches could at least reduce and I could feel a bit better at work.

The main question I was wondering was why it was only on one eye, and if that was bad? I have rubbed my eye before to clear eyelashes and whatnot and thought maybe that might have done it.

Around January 20, 2019, I accidentally sat on my glasses and one of the arms went loose. When I put them back on, I immediately got a headache, but I didn't see any change in my vision. The next day I went to an optician who fixed the loose arm - but I still had a headache. I know I'm quite sensitive to eye stuff so even if my vision seemed fine something was wrong.

I went back the next day to an optician who tightened the glasses a little (enough so I perceived a slight change in perception) and told me to do a checkup with an ophthalmologist just in case. I went the next day and he said everything seemed fine - he gave me a new prescription but said the difference with my current prescription was minimal (slightly more astigmatism in the right eye).

I still had discomfort and pain so I decided to just go and get completely new glasses to start over, with the new prescription. I got them in mid-February but after a week my vision hadn't adapted (fish eye effect, can't focus) so I went back to the place where I got my glasses made. The lady there did a quick check on my vision and told me it seemed my sight was more like my PREVIOUS prescription, and that the prescription the ophthalmologist gave might have been a little skewed because of eye fatigue or other factors. So finally, she put back the old prescription in the new frames.

It has now been three weeks and I still have pain and discomfort. I could describe it as a dull ache that is usually around and in the right eye, but occasionnally with the left one. I also feel numbness from it that spreads to my whole cheeks. In terms of sight I feel like I don't see clear but it's hard to define how. It's like I can't make the focus, especially with faster eye movements, and it makes me dizzy. Screens seem to worsen it a bit.

I must add that I have been going through a depressive episode, and I know headaches are part of the symptoms, however I never had ocular headaches like these in past such episodes + it would be too much of a coincidence with the whole broken glasses thing.

b3yd6f,Optic Neuritis,"I was diagnosed (by 2 ophthalmologists at different offices) with ON about a year and a half ago but I had no pain associated with it. I had a blind spot, a blurry spot, and a dark line horizontally through my vision along with flashes of light. 

Recently, in the same eye, I’ve been experiencing flashes of light as well as some mild, intermittent pain behind and around my eye sometimes with movement, but no change in my vision (the line through my vision has gotten better but never went away completely).

My question is, is this pain consistent with ON pain? (I saw some previous answers stating ON doesn’t hurt but my ophthalmologists and all the MS literature I’ve read said pain is one of the most common symptoms and vision loss is not always significant, my vision loss was barely noticeable).

I had extensive blood work, 2 brain MRIs, and a spine MRI which all came back negative.

I was put on a 10 day round of amox pills for bacterial sinusitis as the dr thought it was so backed up all the stuff was stuck in there... first I got better but then bad again but I'm probably resistant to amoxicillin at this point. :S I have chronic sinusitis with frequent confirmed bacterial infection. It's a structural issue I was born with and in Canada, they don't do anything about it.

I was also given tobramycin drops for my eyes for 5 days. I threw out my old makeup, washed everything thoroughly at home and work, cleaned my phone, got a new toothbrush, everything I could think may be holding bacteria. Initially they cleared up and went from blood red to yellow to white. 

Two days later, my right eye is reddish pink again with very inflamed inner corner and streaking. Both my eyes are aching deeply but especially that right one. What causes pink eye symptoms WITH aching??! It's not eye strain feeling but feels like my actual eyeball aches. Is it probably just sinusitis? Can that make your eyes look super red and goopy?

b4ek39,32 M Monocular Double Vision almost constantly,"Hello,

Some info about me: 

Age: 32

Gender: Male

Body: 5'10 240lbs

Work conditions: I spend a lot of time in front of computers, 6 hours at work and a few hours at home (video games)

Medical conditions: GERD , slight astigmatism, 20/20 vision. Minor size difference in pupils (had this forever)

Switched from ciggs to Juul about 4 months ago, I use Juul fairly often but hope to be wheening off over the next month.

Story on symptoms:

I quit cannabis after 10+ years of daily fairly heavy use (after work only and on weekends), after about 1 week sober i noticed my first floater in my left eye and had some irritation. Saw an optometrist to check it out, was cleared of anything serious and prescribed Olopatadine for the irritation (twice daily for a week, once daily thereafter). I began using the drops and the irritation improved.

At about 3-4 weeks sober (week and half of eye drops)  I started noticing light blurring of my vision mostly at night time, lights had a small glare and just felt off. I chalked it up to cannabis withdrawal and my body just resetting. I then began noticing slight monocular vision in both eyes, see it with either eye closed and sometime when both eyes open. I scheduled an appointment with an Opthalmologist for a second opinion, he did a full dilation exam, slit lamp, poked my eye lid to look at every angle and cleared me of any retinal issues and diagnosed me with Blepharitis, gave me a treatment plan: warm compresses, washing eyelids, fish oil, OTC sustane ultra drops etc ..  I have been doing all of that for week and my double vision is honestly not improving and seems to be getting worse. It not totally constant, usually good in the morning and worse at night. Had a full day where I barely noticed it. But it's starting to scare me. I have had perfect vision my entire life.

Can Blepharitis cause blurry and double vision more or less constantly?

 I understand that it can sometimes chronic and for life, I'm just hoping that  I can manage it with treatment. 

Could my extended cannabis use have contributed? I'm on day 38 sober now, I'm still testing positive for thc in my urine but it's getting lighter on the strip. So do I just need to wait until my body, eyes, etc.. gets used to being sober? 

Any advise, help or ideas is appreciated.

Question: Neurologist or some other doctor?

—History: perfect left eye. Strabismus and amploybia in right. legally blind in right eye. Double Vision which appeared months after second surgery. Used 1.00 reading glasses constantly for two years to keep the alignment straight. 

—Now amploybic eye  ( right) 20/70 crisp and clear. Distortion. This eyes image is on top of the good eyes image. Still all double but wherever it is pointed it shows my good eye and my good eye focuses on it. 

—Left eye. Pain when looking up and to the left. Strain. “Gives out”when the right eye takes over, focuses on overlapping image. Things move in peripheral vision. Flashes. 22 floaters. Spasms. Have videos of the spasms. Constant visual vibration. Small astigmatism in this eye only. Eye pressure is fine. Slight swelling of optic nerve once. Pain in this eye during patching of bad eye. Optic migraine in October 2017.

—Tried patching, prisms, glasses, anxiety meds, therapy, neck massages, chiropractor, antibiotics for congestion. Mri clear. Eye scan of good eye is fine. Currently working on posture, and relaxation.  


Doc says brain/eye is currently evolving. Which is not normal. Talked to him Friday evening, the current prism worked for three weeks then just stopped working. I am supposed to give it a few more days to see if it goes back. After that, if it doesn’t, nothing else can be done.

Unfortunately I'm back for more advice. Thanks so much for all the replies to my first post. Sorry in advance for length but it's been two and a half months and I'm still dealing with this after multiple doctor visits. I would really appreciate any more ideas. :(

**Possibly Relevant** End of October, I had hardware removed from my upper jaw from a previous surgery. Some of the hardware removed was in the area below the affected eye and next to my nose. About a week before this started, I moved in to my friend's place. He has a cat. Cats have never given me allergy trouble although admittedly I have never lived with one before. Recently learned cat has had some sort of eye issue involving discharge, unsure if it was ever diagnosed by the vet. Also about a week before my symptoms started, I spent a small amount of time at a very large bird sanctuary, in close contact with various types of parrots for approximately an hour. 

**Mid-January** Watery eye for about a week, progressed to mucus discharge and crusting in the mornings. 

**Opthamologist #1** Thought it looked like allergies. Prescribed Alaway and Refresh drops. Also used Claritin daily. No improvement. Prescribed Tobradex for a week. Symptoms cleared up, continued showing improvement for a week after discontinuing, but then symptoms returned. 

**Opthamologist #2 (same office, different doc)** Told me to try Tobradex again. No change, symptoms continued. Referred to cornea specialist.

**Cornea Specialist #1** Said it didn't look like an infection. Changed his mind when I showed him photo of my eye from that morning. Prescribed Besivance drops. No change in symptoms. Wanted a culture, doc was out of culture swabs (?!), prescribed Besivance drops every two hours. Again, no change.

**Cornea Specialist #2** I went to visit family across the country and saw another doctor since the Besivance wasn't doing anything. Cultures taken, doc suspected avian chlamydia. Prescribed one week course of doxycycline. Chlamydia results came back negative, discontinued doxy after five days. (Hadn't helped.) Still waiting on fungal culture results. Not sure about other cultures, I have to get a copy of the results. Doc suspected overactive immune response to something, prescribed Neo-poly-dex drops twice a day, then tapered. 

**Current** Seemed like slight improvement on the neo-poly-dex drops but nowhere near symptom free. A couple days into the taper now (once a day) and my eye still feels constantly wet and sticky, and is regularly watering and producing mucus. This morning I woke up with a nice glob of greenish yellow goop in my eye again. :( :( :(

I don't know what to do at this point. Four doctors and two and a half months later, Jesus. Are there more tests I can ask for? Would an x-ray be at all useful? Can I just get the damn thing scooped out and be a pirate?

b6twbh,Cataracts at age 30? Weird Stuff,"Hey everyone.

So a little over 1.5 years ago I started to notice eye floaters and halos around lights. I had it checked out by 2 different optamologists a few months apart and they found nothing serious wrong. The reason for my second appointment was that I started seeing the halos and he said retina and everything are fine but that I had high order aberrations or something and its simply because I’m very nearsighted, and that RLE surgery (essentially cataract surgery) would fix the halos, starbursts, and overall poor night vision (and no he doesnt perform that surgery, so its not like he recommended it for commission). But of course because I care about my eyes I do not want the surgery as it poses at least a small risk and im fine with dealing with the symptoms. 

Now fast forward to today... 1.5 years later. I go to a third ophthalmologist, this time from a different provider because my insurance changed. I went to the appointment just as a precaution and to get my eyes checked just to be sure everything is still ok and to get another opinion. My symptoms have not worsened. 

I told this new optamologist about my symptoms and about the opinion I had received from the previous opthamologist. He laughed and scoffed and asked what his name was, and then made the remark “oh hes just a retina specialist) and that his ideas was insane. Of course, i agree that I do not want RLE surgery, but what this new guy told me terrifies me and sounds even more quacky. 

This new opthamologist went on to say that cataract surgery ALWAYS causes retinal detachment and is never good. Lol. I find that hard to believe because what i have read is that its one of the most successful and common surgeries... yes it poses a little risk but it doesnt make EVERYONES retina detach. This guy scared me like this before even looking at my eyes. He even went on the say that PVD (when the vitreous detaches) ALWAYS causes an RD. Wtf? It increases risk but they dont always tear AND detach the retina. Of course im not a doc, but man i dont like what this guy says. 

Anyways he then proceeds to look at my eyes and pretty quickly says... oh it does look like  you have very minor cataracts (ends up being both eyes), but he brushed it off to not be a big deal and he said I was most likely just born with them.

So... i find that puzzling... sure the way I see does appear to be cataract symptoms but I had 2 prior opthamologist say i had no cataracts and ive had dilated eye exams since i was young and not a single doc said I had cataracts. Do you think this is something that formed recently or is this guy a quack? 

I have a hard time believing this guy because i feel what he says is wrong. Do opthamologist purposely scare people away from surgery so they dont get it? I already made it clear that i have no plans to proceed with surgery and want to put it off as long as i can. But now this guy says i have cataracts apparently.

I asked him more about it but he didnt make a big deal about it. I asked how quickly will it progress and he seemed to state it probably wont and i should be fine until i get old like 60 and its so minor ive probably always had the cataracts in both eyes. 

Is a cataract diagnosis a matter of opinion with docs? Ive never been told i have this before and i dont like how this guy scared me and said the surgery is a guaranteed RD lol.

b7boro,Scintillating scotoma from pressure over maxillary sinus?,"Hi, confused patient here! 

31, F.

Before I start I want to note that I have an appointment to discuss this with my GP on Friday, I would just like to get a general idea of what might be going on first. I have a scientific background and I'm not really able to find any links between these two things.

1) For a couple of months now, when I'm washing my face, relatively gentle pressure over the right maxillary sinus area is creating an area of moving black and white stripes in the vision of my right eye, bottom left corner closest to nose (images of scintillating scotoma is the closest thing I can find to describe it). Only appears during pressure.

2) Years of sinus issues. I wake up with awful puffy droopy face and eyelids which generally regress over the course of the day, I feel like hell, I get low grade fevers. All this despite being on daily nasal steroids (which have helped a great deal- it used to be even worse) a recent MRI (without contrast) has shown ""opacification of the posterior left maxillary sinus. Mild mucosal thickening in the remainder of the paranasal sinuses."" No incidental eye findings in MRI report.

3) Recent eye exam (Dec '18 was normal. I didn't have the air puff test though.)

The L-sided bit has thrown me really as although all sinuses are inflamed, if it was opacification of the R maxillary then that would go some way to explain what's going on.

The nasal steroid is mometasone furoate 50mcg/spray, and I was on 1 spray per nostril for over a year, but for the past 45ish days I have cut down to 1 spray every other day, so I hesitate to blame the steroids.

Thanks for reading, any thoughts would be much appreciated. Not looking for personal advice but whether anyone has any experience of sinus issues/inflammation causing this?

b8b6tj,Im not really sure what to do anymore(eye issues for 3 to 4 months),"Hi. Ive had a host of ey issues since mid december. I don't really know what to so anymore

I have seen a opthamologist in early january at a hospital.  They found nothing. I saw another a month later on a referral and still nothing. Eyes are apperently completely healthy but im still having issuess

Ill note my issues I was having and some still having.
December: the underside of my left eye became swollen. I want to say it was from a natural oil i was using called castor oil because not long before i remmember getting some in my eye. Not long aftee my left eye was very blurry and stayed that way for a month.
Jan:I started seeing floaters. Mostly when looking at natural light. Unsure if they were always there and just started noticing them or were new. This prompted my visits to opthamology
Feb/march: ( i also saw a opthamologist in feb) blurry vision has stopped sort of but im noticing now that my right eye seems more dominant. Like if staring straight at somethiin im looking more at it with my right eye than my left. If i cover my right eye and look straight with my left one, its like I see the darkness from my covered eye because I am focusing with my right eye even though its covered. This leads to what im seeing with my uncovered left eye to fade in and out of focus unless I really focus my eye hard which causes strain and cant keep up for long. Also sometimes it feels like images in my eyes are different sizes but im not really sure if im just stressing out and seeing that.
I also noticed if im watching movie with subtitles written in white, i see them in double for a few seconds. Same with white writing on a black screen. Its basically what i think double vision would look like but only for a few seconds. Normal writing like in books i do not see double.

I do have astigmatism in both eyes so maybe that could be causing it but i just got new glasses a couple months ago so it should be fixed plus i dont think astigmatism causes you to only focus out of one eye.

I know the final answee will be go back to the doctor but do you guys have any insight on this?

b8eb9u,Eye pain with anisocoria?,"Hi.  

I've made an appointment with my ophthalmologist for wednesday, so I will definitely be getting this checked out, but I just wanted to ask you guys if you all think this is an emergency and if I should go to the emergency room instead. It should also be noted that I use contacts and there is a possibility of infection there.  

Around a week ago, I started to notice that my vision was slightly blurred. It wasn't much worse, just slightly worse than I normally see with my contacts in. That night I take my contacts out and (I think?) my vision was better with my glasses and not as blurred as when my contacts were in. Following the blurriness came some mild eye pain a few days later. Not anything unbearable, just a droning mild pain that would come and go. Then, looking in the mirror I noticed that one of my pupils was slightly larger than the other, and the iris in my right eye wouldn't seem to stay in one spot. It would twitch every now and then.  

I should mention that these symptoms come and go, my right eye does not always hurt and my pupil is not always larger than the other. But it's definitely happening on a daily basis. I've tried artificial tears and they help a little, but do not keep the problem completely at bay.  

So that's the size of it. Should I be worrying more than I am and try to get an appointment sooner or go to the emergency room? Is waiting until wednesday to get it looked at a good idea?

baa0eu,5 days post-vitrectomy to treat detached retina,"Howdy!

TL:DR-I’m five days removed from a vitrectomy to repair a detached retina (developed a tear about a month after congenital cataract surgery) and today I’m seeing lots of floaters in the ‘liquid’ (extreme upper) portion of my vision. No ‘black spots’ like what I experienced with the RD. I have a follow up on Thursday...should I go in before then?

Long version:

Had surgery for a congenital cataract at the end of February. On the way to my one month check up i noticenoticed that I had more floaters in my field of vision. Told ophthalmologist, and she diagnosed me with a retina tear. 

She immediately lasered it, and also a ‘suspicious’ spot as well. After the dilation wore off, I noticed many additional ‘background noise’ floaters, a very large new floater, and a large dark spot in the bottom of my vision. Called back into the office later that day and mentioned those things and was blown off by a tech. Called back after hours to get the on-call doctor. She told me it was unlikely that I had a detachment so soon after retina repair. 

Come Friday, the dark spot was growing a bit (a semi-circle coming up 1/3 of the way to the top of my field of vision), so I called the office again. Was told by a tech (again) that it was ‘fine’. On Sunday, the dark spot was approaching my center vision and I freaked out, so I went to the ER. They called my ophthalmologist (different on-call doctor), who told me not to eat or drink anything after 9pm, and to get into their office at 8am. So that was fun. 

Went in at 8 and was told that I had a detached retina. Was immediately referred to a retina specialist at 12:30. After pictures were taken, I was told that the fluid was only 300 microns from the macula, but the surgeon didn’t seem overly interested in doing it that day. I pointed out that I’d actually had this detachment since last Wednesday, and he relented. 

Had a vitrectomy that evening, and the eye was not quite filled up all the way with gas. I believe the detachment was on the superior part of the eye (good b/c staying upright is good for the bubble). Post-op visit the next day was fine, and was told to sleep either face down or on my right, and not to read for at least a week (among other instructions). 

I’ve done pretty well on not reading, except for times when it doesn’t occur to me that I’m ‘reading’, and I’ve been religious about sleeping on my right side (face down is hard). 

Today I noticed quite a few more floaters in the upper part of my field of vision (the liquid part of my vision). The bottom edge of that liquid is a bit above my center vision. 

All of that said, I’d love some insight on my questions:

1. These floaters seem to be of the ‘background noise’ variety (i.e. evenly dispersed, no really recognizable structures that are visible in the majority of the liquid vision area). It occurred to me that perhaps they’ve been there since the surgery but I’m only now noticing because fluid level is increasing or vision is improving. Is that normal, or should I be concerned about a new tear in the retina?

2. One of my incision sites seems to be ‘blowing bubbles’. This is not constant, and I’m not sure if it’s from a bit of gas escaping or from the eye moving around and ‘capturing’ tiny amount sof air in the incision/flap area. Is this normal?

3. Would sleeping face-down be better than on my right, assuming I’m correct about the location of the detachment?

4. Aside from a black spot in my vision (don’t have that...whole vision field seems fine...just varying degrees of blurry), anything else that would prompt me to get in to the retina specialist before my Thursday appointment?

babr5c,Persistent blurry vision after ophthalmoscopy,"Hi all,

I've always had healthy eyes and quite excellent visual acuity. I should mention that originally my **right eye** had been *slighty* worse than my left eye but it was not worth mentioning and the doctor back then (eye exam for driver's license) said overall my vision would still be excellent.
Anyway, about a year ago I made an appointment because sometimes I was seeing some slight strings in my right eye. The doctor checked my eye out and apparently it was completely normal/harmless (floaters).


Now to my actual problem: During the exam the doctor used a mydriatic on that very eye (**right one**) to make sure my retina is fine. I've had the usual side effects (being sensitive to light for a couple of hours on that eye) but eversince I've had this exam my **left eye** has lost its perfect vision.
I didn't think anything of it because I thought it would go away on it's own and never really restricted me but up to this day it's been like this. 

My left eye used to have perfect vision and now I feel, especially when I'm tired, it's worse than my right eye.
What could have happened there? I mean the mydriatic had been used on my right eye and not on my left one but it must have something to do with the exam because it would be a crazy coincidence that I have lost some visual acuity the day after my visit to the doctor.


You might ask yourself why I never went to the doctor with this and to be honest I don't know either. It's probably because despite of this, I still have pretty good vision and I've been thinking of it as a little ache, nothing more.

After my parade of doctors, nothing was better. Pretty much resigned to my fate of ocular oozing for eternity, I went back to my original ophthalmologist, who had first diagnosed me with allergies. After I saw him that first time, he wasn't available when I went back to the office, so I saw another doctor there who then shuffled me off to cornea specialists, etc. Kinda wish he'd been around for my second appointment because I feel like maybe I wouldn't have been miserable for so long. :/ I should get that man a fruit basket or a Starbucks card or something. 

He took a look at me, dropped some dye in, handed me two boxes of lubricating eye drops and basically told me that those drops and I were now best friends, and to stop putting all the other shit in my eyes everyone else had been prescribing that was only making the situation worse.

Y'all. 

DRY. EYES. DRY MOTHERFUCKING EYES.

I was suspicious at first. Sure I have dry eyes, I've only been stuffing them full of various drops for freaking months. But after that week of Refresh drops and allergy drops ... okay, it did clear up for a week before coming back ... I was willing to try it. I was basically willing to try anything, including black magic, to flipping see again.

So I have been religiously dumping a combo of Systane and Refresh drops into my peepers for a week. I saw some gradual improvement. Hope sprung. And TODAY. Today has been the first day since mid-January that I have been able to SEE. I haven't had to wipe goop out of my eye even once. SMEAGOL IS FREE. 

Yeah. My months-long horror show was basically the most mundane eye problem in the world. I have no idea why it was only my left eye. I have no idea what it was doing producing the nastiest-looking mucus ever as a result of being too dry. I have no idea how no one else figured it out. But it seems to be over and I am goddamned thrilled, and I am taking those little vials of Refresh with me literally everywhere I go from now on.",16,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/bac9lu/final_update_eye_infection_for_a_month/"")",2019-04-06 20:19:17,

bb5bol,Third corneal ulcer in 4 years?,"Hello, a few days ago I started experiencing subtle piercing pain in my right eye. The issue feels consistent with a problem I've dealt with twice the past, namely corneal ulcers: first on the left eye 4 years ago, second on the right eye 1 year ago. When I had the first ulcer I waited too long and it got to the point where simply seeing brightly colored objects would trigger intense pain, tearing, photophobia and eventually caused me to lose my chamber and have blurred vision. I was hospitalized for about two months and underwent several treatments and procedures in that time but eventually my eye healed and hasn't bothered me since. Then to my surprise I got the exact same thing on my other eye three years later, only this time I caught it early on and it was fixed within a week just with physiological serum and a therapeutic lens. Or so I thought.

The specialists I've consulted were clueless as to what might've caused the ulcers, though most of them pointed to physical trauma. The last one suggested that my corneas might be unusually thin and more prone to ""breaking"" due to dryness and prescribed me [these eye drops](http://www.labticianthea.com/products/thealoz-duo/) which I take every 3 hours or so. Something else she pointed out is that both ulcers happened in the exact same spot on both eyes, which if anything makes the whole thing even more confusing.

The earliest I could get an appointment with an ophthalmologist is on Monday but in the meantime I was wondering if there's anybody here that might've dealt with cases like mine in the past and could clue me in on what might be causing it.

bbazs2,Eye bone pain,"Hi r/eyetriage

First my ophthalmologist is already researching this but I wanted to see if any others might have an idea of what this is.

I have a slew of eye conditions: Retinitis Pigmentosa, cystoid macular edema, uveitis, pars planitis, iridocyclitis, blepharitis, and tear film insufficiency.

I take restasis drops 2 times a day and diamox 500mg 2 times a day for the CME..yuck.


The best way I can explain this is my eye bone (I know that’s not the right term) on the outside corner about where my bottom and top eyelid meet, is very tender. It’s bilateral and I’ve always assumed it was something to do with all these headaches I get, which I assumed is because of how crap my eyes are. The pain does not follow up the bone but I also have some tenderness on the inside corner.

My eyes also feel like I have strained them or pulled a muscle, looking down and to the side causes more pain and I have a fairly consistent headache behind my eyes.

My ophthalmologist yesterday said something about a ligament on the outside corner and I want to say he said something about it possibly being inflamed.  He is doing more research on it because he didn’t have an answer for me right then.

bbozrn,23yr old with higher IOP,"I am seeking some advice or ideas on what is currently going on with my IOP to try and alleviate my fear/stress. Thanks in advance!

At my last regularly scheduled eye exam (last August) I was informed I have above average IOP (27), and that it has been higher in the two years prior as well. I went back a couple weeks later to take the field vision test  and I did great, and then when she examined my eyes at the rod and cone layer, everything looked great as well. I believe even my optic nerve looked normal, too. However, she said the next time I come in, if it’s still high, we will have consider starting eye drops to prevent Glaucoma. This, of course, has caused me QUITE a bit of stress as I am rather young to even be thinking of Glaucoma, and I am concerned as to why she seem rushed to prevent if everything seems healthy. She told me there isn’t really anything I can do to help it, but I would really appreciate outside opinions on the situation. 

Note: I would most likely be considered a high stress individual and perhaps that is why it is so high? I work full time while attending school full time (and have been for the past 4 years), so lots of stressors on top of a hectic personal life.

bc9krp,Weird RNFL Thickness Map w/ Analysis Paperwork,"(Paragraph 4 is question)

Background: Before you panic at these results for me (if necessary), I’m going to an ophthalmologist in about a week. I have no medical training of any kind, but I’ve taken enough college classes to know how to find peer reviewed information. Because of this, I have been reading professional papers about optics nerve findings. After about a week of unguided research, I’ve learned enough to understand basic terminology related to conditions, but nothing that I can be sure pertains to my situation. That’s why I am here.

I’ve not seen an optometrist for several years, so this didn’t necessarily “come out of nowhere,” but who knows. I’ve finally gone in, and have been given these results to take with me to an ophthalmologist. 

I’ve been researching papilledema and IIH, and think I’m probably going to end up with a diagnoses for IIH, due to other symptoms. But, once again, I have no medical training and understand I could be missing a whole slew of things that come to an obvious diagnosis for which I have no knowledge.

The question: After much research, I’ve come to find that my RNFL Thickness Map looks absolutely insane compared to so many others that I’m seeing online. Is it that I’m off the charts, and that the reading can not be done properly? Does this reading look like something you’d imagine is accurate, or perhaps a machine error? Would you consider this weird even for a reading for drusen?

bcpxfp,Is there something really wrong with my vision?,"My life has been spiraling downwards for the past year. I have been to ophthalmologists and a psychiatrist. I just came here because I don't know what else to do. I know you guys shouldn't have to deal with my bullshit but I desperately need some input. **I try to remain as rational as possible and ignore these as much as possible but they are taking a toll on me. I just want you read the following if you will and tell me if its all in my head like everyone seems to think or is it real?** I am 25.

One day about an year ago I woke up with my **vision looking different**. After careful examination I found that as if someone had increased the transparency of my left eye, my left eye was seeing slightly darker, colours were less vibrant and my right eye was filling in for my right eye. I went to an ophthalmologist for an eye check up, he did a dilated exam and found nothing and asked me to do a Visual field test, VEP and MRI. Here I should mention that I had a JNA tumour removed from my nasopharnyx about 12 years ago in an emergency operation. After the operation, I couldn't see from my left eye because of extreme light sensitivity, glare and pain when I opened that eye. At that time this same doctor checked the eye and he thought that there was damage to left optic nerve. I fully regained my vision after 2 months and had no problems till now. I don't know if it is relevant to my current problem.

Anyways the Visual field test came back with paracentral scotoma and VEP showed markedly reduced amplitude, and high P100 latency in both eyes with left eye more affected. The doctor said that there was a problem and there is no treatment for this sort of things. The MRI of orbit showed that nothing is wrong and the optic nerve had normal signal and intensity.

After two months, I developed mild **monoocular diplopia (ghosting)** in both eyes, **strarbursts**, **halos** and **glare** in both eyes. I went to the same doc and a corneal specialist who both said that there was nothing wrong with my eyes, Corneal topography was also unremarkable. They have remained the same, maybe the glare has increased a bit. And there is now a **pulsatile shimmering** around some type of lights.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, I had **flickering vision**, **flashes of lights**, **pinprick lights,** **more floaters** (I had some already since a long time and am not sure if they are new), small pinprick lights. Along with this came **increased head pressure, dizziness that comes and goes** and some **balance problems**. I seem to notice things in my peripheral vision more. Looking at walls makes me think that it is flickering and it seems I can see the flickering when I close my eyes. If I am reading something while lying down and if I suddenly move my eyes upwards to focus on something far away, there is an immediate **flash of white light** in both eyes. My vision also sometimes seems a little blurry. I had also developed **palinopsia** and my **afterimages** **were prolonged**. When I closed one of my eyes, and tried to see with my other eye a **grainy veil overtook my vision**, opening both eyes clears it immediately. I vision also seem to vibrate sometimes.

I went to another ophthalmologist (retina specialist) because my old doc was not available and he checked my eyes with different things for 20 mins after listening to my problems. He couldn't find anything wrong. He asked me to another visual field test and this time he told me to concentrate. This time there was no scotoma and the test came back fine. The doctor said that I probably did not concentrate in the previous test and that caused the wrong result. The doctor then said that he doesn't know why the VEP came out that way. But he said if I had an optic nerve problem, it would be in one eye, and both eyes would not be affected symmetrically and he concluded that the VEP was not clinically relevant. And as I had a visual acquity of 6/6, I don't need to worry.

But the flicker kind of worries me. I can notice the flicker with both eyes even with the eyes closed. My vision seems a bit blurry. And gives me crippling anxiety that I am losing my vision. It makes me smoke more, which gives me more cough and nausea and head pressure and more eye problems.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been to a psychiatrist recently. He told me that if it was optic nerve problem then I shouldn't see the flickering while eye closed. He told me to get my anxiety under control and remove stressor from my life. I have also been  coping my mother's sudden death two months ago, which according to him is a big stressor along with my career problems. According to him, I have altered personality, anxiety, depression and obsessive tendencies. He hasn't been giving me any medication yet and wants me to report in next visit.

Now, I really want to get out of this situation I am in. Is it just my brain playing tricks on me? Is it just me going insane like my family and friends seem to think?

bctvrj,Restoring Vision in Eye After Cataract Surgery As Infant,"Hello r/eyetriage,

I realize posting on here does not compare to going to the ophthalmologist but I wanted to get some preliminary ideas just to see what I can expect during my actual visit so I really appreciate any information anyone can share be it anecdotes, latest research, etc.

I was born in March, 1989 with a cataract in my left eye and had it surgically removed not even a week after being born. Since the surgery, my parents were advised to cover my right eye with an eye patch and place a contact lens on my left eye to help restore vision. I apparently didn't take kindly to that and kept removing the eye patch and never liked having the lens in my eye.

So my parents buckled and stopped this. Fast forward 30 years later, I'm blind in my left eye and my right eye prescription hovers around -4.25. From previous visits to optometrists and ophthalmologists, it turns out I never received an IOL during the cataract surgery, so my left eye has no lens. This may have influenced the eye, because its pupil is very large, misshapen and I often experience light sensitivity as a result of this.

So I wanted to ask how possible would it be restore vision in my eye? What are my options? Would receiving a lens transplant help in any way?

If not, does the eye have any value if it has no vision?

Had really bad infection on right eye. Redness, swollen eye, itchiness, tons of yellow mucus.

First optometrist diagnosed allergies. Prescribed me antihistamine eyedrops. Didn't get better.

Primary doctor diagnosed blepharitis, prescribed me erythromycin ointment for 5 days. Used for more than 5 days, I believe 10 days.. Didnt get better. 

Opthalmologist diagnoses acute conjunctivitis, prescribed me neo-poly-dex eyedrops. No more mucus and eye feels so much better.

However, when I sleep and wake up, my eyes are so dry my eyes feel like they're stuck to my eyelid until I continue to blink and then it goes back to normal. Still has a groggy feeling during the day though. Skin around my eye is also super dry and flaky (maybe good to mention I also have eczema but I've never had it around my eye before). My left eye is fine. 

Is this an effect of all the medication I put in my eye? Or is there still an issue? It's been a few nights of my eye being ""stuck"".  

My cousin told me it was allergies and eczema. Is this true? Or should I go to the opthalmologist again?

bdb7y3,I'm legally blind and I might be losing my right eye due to some strange blur/membrane that doctors here can't see or figure out - it's not cataracts or damage to the retina - please read and give advice if possible.,"I'd like to apologize up front because I don't think it's even remotely possible to narrow this down in a few sentences so this is bound to be a long and probably difficult to read post.

I'm about 90% legally blind though I work as a professional illustrator, play video games and generally what little sight I have is of utmost importance to me in life. I have a whole slew of issues with my eyes, was born fully blind with a severe case of congenital cataracts in both eyes, around 8 months I underwent a surgery or two, I also have microphtalmia and the anatomy of my eyes is supposedly atypical or some such. I'm no medical professional and that's the best I am able to summarize my issues with.

Surgery on both my eyes is STRICTLY forbidden by all doctors Iv'e went to because any and all surgical intervention could result in total blindness and severe damage.

&amp;#x200B;

I war +11 glasses, though I'm not necessarily nearsighted or farsighted  

&amp;#x200B;

\- I use my left eye for pretty much everything, my sight on that ain't good but it's much better than what I got on my right eye. I was diagnosed with high eye pressure in 2015 or 2016 on my left/main eye, but that's been under control with Xalatan and Azopt eyedrops. In fact I had my eye pressure checked on Thursday and it was only 12 in that eye which is awesome.

&amp;#x200B;

\-  My right eye's pupil is closed up due to all the surgeries, but there is a small opening. Even so, the image I get from it is nice and clear, just very dark and small, with or without glasses. If enough light shines through it and if I bring up whatever I want to see or read real close to it I can read it with effort even without glasses, such as my Phone or handheld game console screens. With my +14 ""reading"" glasses I can even draw on paper with that eye if the lighting is good, however those glasses are too strong and I do tend to avoid using them as they make my eyes hurt and aren't good for reading on their own anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, I use my left eye for everything. again I wear +11 glasses tho in order to draw, play video games, watch something or read something I have a technique of ""zooming in"" by propping the glasses up on my nose, stronger glasses do not produce this effect but that's a whole other topic. For those of you guys who can see here's a short documentary about me so you might be able to see the way I position my glasses to see:

[https://youtu.be/Z2siWfBKucA](https://youtu.be/Z2siWfBKucA) 

This was filmed over 2 years ago, but my condition is still the same and always has been, zooming in with my glasses has helped me a ton through life.

&amp;#x200B;

**NOW finally we're getting to the topic at hand.**

Starting July of 2018 or so I noticed that I had a hard time seeing text on my phone whenever I'd bring it up close to my right eye (left one is fine with zooming in with my glasses.) Around September or so I also noticed my vision blurring on my right eye and noticed some floaters, it got so bad that lights and stuff looked broken up and distorted BUT ONLY if I had my upper eyelid in its normal position, if I'd open up my eye wide open the blur would go up with the eyelid, granted I can't focus my eye like that but the blur wouldn't be there. I went to my doctor, one of the best in the country, he brushed it off as nothing, laughed in my face for panicking even tho i was fairly collected and didn't even prescribe anything.

My doctor did examine my eye of course, did an echo on it, not sure of what the English term for this is, found nothing and told me not to worry and started messing with me.

&amp;#x200B;

This was back in September.

My right eye is still completely useless, I still have that film/membrane like blur whenever my eyelid is in its normal state/position and I still can't see squat through it, everything looks like I'm seeing it through a photoshop Gaussian Blur filter set to pretty high.

As soon as I open my eyelid or movie it up with my finger the blur moves up with it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Over the past months I did the following with varying results:**

&amp;#x200B;

1. **I used artificial tears, someone suggested it might be dry eye, those solved nothing.**
2. **Used eye drops called Proculin/Prokulin - these cleared the blur up 100% within 2 days or so, my eye was fully functional and blur free for 3 days when it slowly started coming back and the Prokulin eyedrops started being ineffective**
3. **Had my eye tested for bacterial infections - those turned up nothing**
4. **Used some antibiotic eye drops, the name escapes me and those once again cleared the blur up within 2-3 days, eye was fully functional and blur free for about 3 days again just for the blur to start coming back and the eye drops to stop being effective once again.**
5. **Tried several other types of eye drops to no avail**

&amp;#x200B;

I also noticed that the blur SEVERELY increases when I try to focus my eye(I also have mustangs), when I'm in a bright area or if I look at a light source, the more I focus my vision the blurrier it becomes and stays that way until I've gone to a darker envirionment for a bit, granted this blur doesn't always lessen but still. Of course even in dim lighting or darkness the blur never fully goes away, unlike with the eyedrops i mentioned above.

The blur is so thick I can't even see the clock on my iPhone 6s and that's a big clock.

&amp;#x200B;

Thursday, April 11th 2019 - few days before i made this post -  I went to see my eye doctor again.

I explained my problem and he once again saw nothing, had no idea what it was and was EXCEPTIONALLY rude, right down to sarcastically suggesting that we should just go see a psychic or that he does see a ton of bad stuff but won't tell us. He also rudely told me to shut up when I was trying to shed some more light on the situation and give him more details. Since I live in Macedonia and everyone in any kind of position here has massive massive political connections and what not, they're not afraid of being sued or nothing. He did examine the eye but couldn't see anything and had no idea what was up nor did he have any suggestions about what we should do.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing my doctor kept ignoring is the fact that the device that normally checks your glasses prescription/what type of glasses you need couldn't even get a reading on that eye, because I couldn't see anything through it where as in the past it would immediately detect whatever it detects no problem. So even the device couldn't read my eye.

&amp;#x200B;

We had no other option but to leave, he prescribed some eyedrops that don't seem to do much of anything and I'm still at a loss as to what is going on. Getting around is difficult for me as is due to being legally blind, now it's even more difficult that all I see is blur on my right eye unless I keep it wide open which is kind of not really an option plus the eye can't focus properly like that.",6,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/bdb7y3/im_legally_blind_and_i_might_be_losing_my_right/"")",2019-04-14 20:01:47,

This is going to sound very strange, but my right eye ""feels"" like it's blurry but it's actually not (at least as far as I can tell). I'm not experiencing any pain or other physical symptoms. When I close one eye and test out my vision, my right eye is not blurry, but just looking around with both eyes open it feels like the bottom of my right eye is blurry.

Not sure if it's relevant but I've been seeing a few floaters for a few months now from both eyes, but nothing unusual I think. I also wear contacts, and switching out for new contacts doesn't help.

Help!","I've been struggling with red, irritated eyes lately, especially in the past few months since I've started my first full-time job as an accountant. My eyes always turn red and feel very dry starting within the first hour of work. I have various brands of lubricant eye drops: Refresh Optive Gel Drops, Thera Tears, Systane Gel Drops, Lumify, Refresh Liquigel, etc. I usually apply a drop to each eye when I first get to work, and then a few times throughout the day (3-5 times) as my eyes start to get irritated. I have also downloaded flux and dimmed my screen along with adjusting the hue to decrease blue-light. I even wear blue-light glasses. However, I honestly look either high or unbelievably tired by 9AM no matter what. 

I went to the eye doctor recently and he said he did notice a lot of dryness along my lower lash line due to my eyes being slightly open when I sleep. He diagnosed me with nocturnal lagopthalmos and told me to use gel drops before bed and put on a sleeping mask. I apply a heat compress 3-5 times a week for about 5 minutes before bed followed with gel drops. I've also been using my new Eco Eyes Eyeseals 4.0 for the past week, but the redness still persists.

bdk07t,"Asking all Optometrist, ophthalmologist and eye doctors in general: A Few days after an eye exam, I see a new visual disturbance when I blink","Sex: female
Age: late teens
Symptoms:
- floaters (had them since I was like 13, and since then, they have been very slowly getting worse so it doesnt bother too much)
- theres some thinning in my detina but the specialist its nothing to worry about right now
- I am myopic and my prescription is about -3.00 in both eyes
- have a mild case of visual snow, as long as I keep myself busy I don't notice\care for it
- also have BFEP

Had two eye exams: within the span of 4 weeks. Both noticed thinning but said its nothing to worry about and other than that my eyes look healthy. The first one with my optometrist was the first time I had my eyes dilated, other than light sensitivity and tingling sensation of eye it was ok. Second one was with retina specialist, the eye drop dilation bruned and an hour after the exam my peripheral vision seemed shaky\shifty like a spasm when I was in an area that was bright, that went away the next day.

After initial eye exam I started using a warm compress as i was told my eyes a dry. I did that for a couple days and when I stopped, I noticed a new visual disturbance. Had the shape of a bent tube. Looks transparent, looks kinda glassy, has a sheen look to it. It does not ""float"" around like my floaters and only moves along with my vision.
It also seems to be in my left eye.
After the second dilation, it became a bit more vivid. And slowly i started noticing more shapes attached to it. 

I pretty much see it now whenever i blink or am in bright lighting. I can only notice a small portion of it in low lighting when i blink.

Should I be worried I really dont wanna go back, Im scared that the dilation is what caused it so i dont wanna have my eyes dilated again. Plus these appointments were recent and both docs said that other than the stretched retina, my eyes look healthy.

Note: it now kinda looks like a spider if you were to draw one as lines. It takes on a shape thats kinda like this: 来 (just remove the top horizontal line and that almost pretty much the shape i see) 
At first it looked more like this: ر but then slowly progressed into this 来

I was thinking maybe I was seeing my retina because i was it while the doc was checking my eyes with light and that this was some sorta after image but now im scared its a floater thats just getting bigger but the thing is it doesnt act like my other floaters and now im stressed that i have yet another visual disturbance. Doc said i should go back if i notice like a lot of floaters in my view but im not even sure if this is a floater and even if it is its like only tho of a size that it is kinda annoying. The only thing im tryna be positive about if im gonna have to live this now too is that it generally disappears once i focus on an object but its just annoying cuz it whenever i blink.

He said my cornea was flat and he said it would help with my struggling to read road signs as I didn’t have a change in my prescription. He put me in one-day acuvue moist because of the base curve. But I have a couple of questions I’m hoping someone on here can answer.

Will just changing base curve (I assume this is the shape?) really help my vision?

Will the inflammation heal or will this just prevent it from getting worse?

And looking online it looks like these come in 30 or 90 pack options which only adds up to 360 days and that’s assuming you never lose a lens. What do people do for the other days?

benwv1,Persisting Vision Issues,"Gender: Male

Age: 32

Blue Eyes, 20/20 vision both eyes, mild astigmatism in both eyes

Looking for some advise or thoughts on the recent vision issues I have been experiencing. 

About 2.5 months ago I quit heavy cannabis use cold turkey (12+ years everyday). Shortly after quitting I began to have eye irritation and noticed a few floaters. I immediately saw an optometrist who performed a dilated eye exam and ruled out any retinal detachment. She diagnosed me with allergic conjunctivitis and prescribed some allergy eye drops. I tried these for few weeks and the irritation went away. 

I began to notice some monocular double vision in both eyes and other floaters (most likely due to my anxiety from withdrawals, I was noticing everything)

I made an appointment with an opthalmologist to get a second opinion, he then diagnosed me with Blepharitis/dry eye. Gave me a treatment plan of eye lid washes, warm compresses, artificial tears and Omega 3's. I followed the plan religiously for 4 more weeks and saw little Improvement. 

My double vision is pretty constant, both eyes will fluctuate throughout the day and are definitely worse at night. I spend a lot of time in front a computer so that wasn't helping either. 

I basically see an overlapping image of text and objects usually vertically. Top and bottom. Sometimes it was 10% overlap to almost 90%. I see it with both eyes open  when both eyes are acting up, but generally it happens when I close either eye. 

I am also experiencing starburst with both eyes at night with bright lights. The starburst are shorter all around the light with several long streaks that point directly down, if I turn my head those streaks rotate, and when I force my eye lids open more, they go away but it's hard to keep them wide open and usually makes my vision blurry. 

I do have dry eye symptoms, irritated eyes, slight dull pain in my eye socket , dry gritty feeling but even when I don't feel any of these my vision problems are noticable.

I did 3 weeks of steroid eye drops, and now on a 3 week (once a week) 1mg azrithomycin antibiotic treatment to assist with inflammation.

I'm still not noticing much improvement at week two. The next step is punctual plugs. Before I continue this treatment and stuff plastic in my tear ducts, anyone else have any ideas on what's going on? Maybe some options I can ask my opthalmologist about? Corneal topography or something. 

I have had perfect sharp binocular type vision  my entire life with no eye issues. I quit weed and my eyes just go out of whack.

bewak2,Unstable right eye - 2.5 weeks until ophthalmologist appointment,"I'm a 30 year old male currently living in Germany. I have no pre existing conditions except for some allergies. I had LASIK 3 years ago and since the surgery, my right eye was always weaker in terms of sharpness but it was never noticeable until recently. 

At the beginning of the month, I started dealing with an issue in my right eye with the following symptoms:

Blurry vision that fluctuates during the day, sometimes it's sharp, sometimes it's not - but 85% during the sunny day when I'm outside my vision is at 100%. However, during the night, my eyes feel tired and my right eye is blurry. Blurry in the sense that I'm nearsighted again and items that are far away are not sharp. 

I also noticed that my right eye does not let in as much light as my left eye. This is noticeable indoors and at night. Lastly, my right eye feels heavier. Not sure how to explain it but it feels tired.

A weeks ago, I went to an ophthalmologist for a drop in appointment and she looked at my eye for a few minutes with her machine. She said it looks like allergies, gave me some eye drops and let me go. Due to how the industry here is in Germany, many places do not accept new patients and appointments have to be set weeks in advance. She did not do a thorough check up.

My appointment with another clinic is in 2.5 weeks where they will perform a full check up. Right now, I'm a little worried and wondering if I should go back to an ophthalmologist as soon as possible. Or even an optometrist for a quick eye check-up - not sure how helpful they will be though. 

I've been doing constant research online and it could be anything from cataracts, glaucoma, MS, blood sugar due to diabetes etc. Hoping it will go away on its own though. 

One thing I did not mention above is that this issue started occurring right when I switched to a new diet and started training for a marathon. I went from exercising a few times a month to 6x a week. Could this be related? Possibly due to my new diet and routine? I was thinking that but it's been nearly 3 weeks with this same issue. Luckily the problem has not gotten worse.

bf0zmr,Complicated eye problems. Need insight,"Before I start,  I want to say i have a myriad of eye problems in my left eye. 
1. I was born 3 months premature and as I've been told ""part of my eye didn't develop"" which as a result I was born blind in my left eye,  a lazy eye,  and it is more sunken in/ snake than my right. 
2. My right eye has decent vision,  is bigger,  and not lazy eye. 
3. In 2011/2012 I developed a cataract in my left eye (mid twenties) it was left untreated as I did not have an eye doctor and I can't see out of that eye anyway so I left it be. 
4. Turned into hyper mature cataract so it's very noticeable,  on top of my lazy eye.
5. Saw eye doctors in 2018-now. About 6-7 years later,  they said I have glaucoma.  My eye pressure is 54. In the right eye my pressure is 14.
6. Did B Scan, said my cornea is flatter and eye is smaller and different than right eye.  
7. I want to have cataract surgery as I strongly feel the cataract caused the glaucoma,  because I saw eye doctors growing up and they never diagnosed the left eye with anything apart from optic nerve damage as a baby and to just wear glasses. 
8. First opthamologist in 2018 said I have such a unique case,  plus my IOL lens is 54 and they don't make lenses that high.  He said cataract surgery is too risky and wouldn't recommend it but referred me to Johns Hopkins for my unusual case.
9. Just went to Johns Hopkins.  They want to do laser surgery for eye pressure and wouldn't recommend cataract surgery because of the risk of complications with my particular eye and the vision more than likely won't be restored. 
10. I feel removing the cataract will solve the glaucoma because that's what brought it on.  Treating the symptom by reducing pressure and keeping the cataract in the pressure will always be high and I'll have to continue eye drops and possibly another laser surgery to control the pressure. 

So what do I do?
Continue the drops and try to manage without risking my eye. 
Do laser surgery in hopes it'll help the pressure yet risk my eye. 
Do cataract surgery in hopes to control the pressure and eye damage yet risk damage to my eye short or long term. 

I don't have a normal eye so I'm scared even the laser treatment that's less invasive could be damaging.  I mean if they don't want to remove the cataract anyway why not just do the drops.

bf1a31,Cataract surgery,"I was born blind in my left eye as well as a lazy eye.  I'm now 30. 
I developed a cataract about 6 or 7 years ago which turned into a hypermature cataract.  I also have glaucoma in that eye.  The eye pressure is 54 and it is 14 in the seeing eye.
I know cataract surgery probably won't restore the vision,  but I strongly feel it causes the glaucoma the eye pressure because I never had it until I saw ophthalmologists after my cataract. I've spoken with two opthamologist and one retina specialist.  All three say because of the unique case of my eye,  it's too risky to do the cataract surgery and the alternative is trying to manage the eye pressure
 Well, if the cataract is causing the eye pressure,  wouldn't the obvious thing to do would be to take it out. 
If the doctors are correct and it's too risky because of the way my eye is (cornea being flat,  small eye,  pupil not dilating, hypermature cataract, caused a lot of damage already).... what happens if I leave the cataract for the rest of my life?

bf1wqk,Cataract sugery,"
Said i wasnt going to do this but here I go anyways. I""m a 33 year old male, about 10 years ago I had cataract sugery on my right eye. The surgery was chill, however after the 1 day follow up I noticed blackness in the right corner of my eye (I know now that it was the ""curtain"" warning sign) but my surgeon dismissed it. After that all went smooth no signs, symptoms at all despite the black spot. Then came my one month, got immediately called in and was told my retina was detaching. Long story short i underwent 2 more surgeries with no success. Money ran out, was on the verge of being evicted, so sadly i watched my vision go and endured the oh so fun headaches. Now my left eye is clouding and I'm scheduled for a sugery, (obviously different facility) was checked out by an ophthalmologist referred to a specialist, asked to see a retina specialist who did an extensive check and cleared me. Staff were taken aback (it's super routine for them) by my concern but have been awesome. Have money saved up (actually have a good career now) family willing to chip in but I'm still a little terrified, not of the sugery but after. Any words of advice, reassurance?

Also regarding my right eye, the cataract was mature so was the retina specialists opinion that they couldn't see it prior (why after he couldn't figure) and that the detachment was most likely there already

bf9yn8,Eye Problems and Don’t Have Money For Surgery What Should I Do? Or Just Your Input on my Problem Will Be Helpful,"Hello Reddit! I wanted to share the problems I am currently going through with me eye. Sorry if this is the wrong sub reddit to post this to.

**Background Info:**
I have always had shitty vision and problems with my eyes my whole life since I was born but when I was maybe around 15 or so my retina came detached in my left eye out of the blue one day so I went for a surgery to get it fixed but it came detached again so I had another surgery to get it fixed again and I think it happened one more but this time the doctor took the lens out of my eye so this means I can’t focus on stuff it’s just blurry but he did this without my permission because it was “to cloudy” and I still haven’t got it put back in yet and it’s been about 3 years now oh also my retina is partially detached on the bottom so my left eye is pretty much useless.

**Current Day:**
I am correctly 18 and still having problems with my left eye basically the oil they used during surgery to hold the retina in place is breaking apart in my eye so this makes it so my left eye is all bloodshot 24/7 also my eyes are very light sensitive I can’t even look at screens, look around, look at lights, or even look outside without it bothering my eyes also it’s very painful at times depending on what im looking at (lights the worst tho) or if I sit or lay a certain way also it waters a lot too but since im 18 now I am no longer on my parents Medicaid plan which means I can’t get the surgery because my family or I don’t have the money to do it so I tried and went online to apply for Medicaid but no luck I just keep getting a error saying I already have a active case which I don’t so I went and did it in person and it went through but a few months later I get told that im denied and have to do it all again and wait months again.

You guys have no idea the shit I go through on a daily basis trying to deal with my eye and I still go to school and do everything it’s just very difficult and even sometimes I feel like im causing even more damage to my eye doing all this because sometimes I see white flashes which I believe is my retina coming fully detected again and when this happens it’s hurts even when I don’t see the flashes my eye still hurts super badly at time if I don’t get this taking care of soon I will probably be in even more pain and cause permanent damage if it hasn’t already and maybe lose my eye which would suck I haven’t been able to see a doctor in a few months or schedule any surgeries because we just don’t have the money and with all this Medicaid bs I don’t see it being fixed anytime soon which sucks this is affecting my left so much. Sorry if I didn’t explain this to well but what do you guys suggest I do? I know posting this might be pointless just want to get some input.

bfn0mn,Left eye gets double vision seemingly randomly.,"To start, I had lasik eye surgery in 2017. Ever since the surgery, my vision has been not so good, which my doctor seems to think is from large pupils. I am now taking Xiidra for dry eye and Bromonidine to keep the pupil from dilating. However, with or without these eye drops, my left eye keeps getting double vision randomly. It isn't as noticeable if I allow my left eye to ""go lazy"" or droop. My lasik doctor found no astigmatism whatsoever and my eyes are not misaligned and otherwise perfectly healthy.

bg3gxr,I’m REALLY REALLY scared at the moment. I just need someone to guide me. What should I do and what doctor should i visit? I’ll keep it short for those who dont want to read this so there is a TLDR at the end of this post!,"I’m a 22  year old female and my BMI is currently 23. When i was diagnosed it was about 25

2 years ago i felt like i was losing a bit of vision so i went to my ophthalmologist (who specializes in cataracts and cornea) to get new glasses. He noticed that I have papilledema so he referred me to a neurologist.

I had a lumbar puncture. My pressure was only 21 but they still took some of the fluid.

The neurologist diagnosed me with IIH. I had the symptoms at the time like nausea, tinnitus and headaches.

He put me on diamox for a month. After that he put me on BOTH diamox and furosemide for a month. Later i was only on diamox.

My ophthalmologist said the papilledema was getting better. After 4ish months of being on these meds i stopped all of the diuretics. The nausea went away a week or so after stopping the meds.

I felt nauseous 1 month after stopping so i went back to my ophthalmologist without telling him that i have nausea. It was a regular check up and he noticed that the papilledema actually came back so i was put on diamox again. 

The papilledema went away.

Later it came back after stopping the meds. 

i was on diamox again.

Papilledema went away again and i stopped them.

They didnt find a reason for this. But my vision was good again after those diuretics. 

After 1.5 yrs I went to a neuro-ophthalmologist. I had slight papilledema at the time and symptoms but I wasn’t on any meds. He suspected I might have pseudo-papilledema. I told him my ophthalmologist actually suspected this as well but he later find out it wasn’t  pseudo. He was still skeptic

He asked me if i wanted to be on diuretics again or stop them. I told him i wanted to stop them due to side effects so he allowed me to do that if i had regular check ups with him only. I had the visual field test done and it was good.

I visited the neuro-ophthalmologist again after 4ish months. I was symptom-free but i still had the papilledema though and it was the same. It didn’t improve or become worse. He says it’s mild anyway

I had a bright scan done and he told me there are some calcium deposits. He says they’re called Drusen.

He claimed that they‘re probably there since birth and told me not to worry about them since they’re not causing me any symptoms. 

He eventually concluded i might have pseudo-papilledema along with papilledema.

Now im scared of the drusen I have honestly. I don’t want to lose vision because of it. Does it even cause vision loss? 

So my main question is what kind of ophthalmologist should I visit for these issues? And should i worry about the drusen? 

If it matters, im visiting the US soon. Is there a specific doctor or hospital i should visit?

*TLDR:*
After thinking i need new glasses i was diagnosed with papilledema and IIH. I was on diuretics and the papilledema improved.

It came back later and i was on meds again.

I stopped meds and another ophthalmologist found out i have drusen which might cause pseudo-papilledema. My other ophthalmologist suspected that initially but he confirmed I actually DO have papilledema. 

So the new optha said it might be papilledema along with pseudo.

So my main question is what kind of ophthalmologist should I visit for these issues? And should i worry about the drusen? I’m scared honestly.

bgamwv,I got some bleach in my eye so I washed it out in the shower for about 10-15 minutes. But my eye/vision feels not right. Am I SOL?,"I was filling up a bathroom cleaning thing with a crushed bleach tablet and it was mixed with water and it sort of burst right near my left eye and got in it. I got in the shower, washed it out for 10 minutes, got out, googled, it said to wash it out for a minimum of 15 minutes, so I went back in and washed it out for 5 more minutes.

My vision was cloudy for a bit and it felt like I scratched my eye and it burned. I put some drops in and took ibuprofen and it seemed like the cloudiness went away. I called the ophthalmologist next day and they were booked but they gave me an emergency medical appointment with the optometrist the next morning.

The optometrist told me all my eye structures looked fine and to just use some eye drops that she gave me and I would be fine. They did a quick eye test and she said my vision is 20/20 in the left eye. However, something feels off. It sort of hurt/hurts but it isn't in pain too much anymore unless I strain it and focus on it a lot.

Anywho, it seems like my left eye isn't as sharp as my right eye anymore. I could swear it was never a problem but now when I look at my phone with my glasses on or off (esp. off) with my left eye it sort of seems like the eye gets confused and words are sort of blurry. The right eye is perfectly fine.

Everything just seems a bit blurrier, especially smaller stuff. Also, it seems like white text on a black background really bothers me. Really bright stuff like digital clocks or lights seem like it makes me see double sort of (like the light is floating above the light source). 

Its been like 4-5 days and its still not better. Will it ever get better? Am I just imagining things? I would ask to make an appointment with the ophthalmologist but I've got there so much due to other things this year I'm kind of embarrassed. Also the optometrist told me everything looks great and didn't tell me to come back or anything.

bgkq49,The Dr. Is planning 1 lens implants for my 5 yr old daughter.,"So backstory..... My father in law, and my wife had cataracts, 4 of 5 kids have cataracts. 

My wife had lenses removed at 5 and implants in at 10, this meant she wore incredibly thick glasses for five years. Our oldest (17) had surgery at 9 and now has issues with the left lens. We were told this is due to being done to early. He has infections around once year in that eye, and states it feels like something is in his eye on occasion.

The 14 year old had lenses removed at 12 and implants 2 weeks later. Vision has improved greatly it seems. The 12 year old has ""spider web"" like cataracts and doesn't even need glasses, yet. No plans for surgery with him in the near future. The 7 months old has no cataracts yet! Yippeee! 

My 5 year, Loo, old was in to see our Dr in December, and again today. She has always told us it is best to wait until older for surgery, due to the eyes maturing. Today she expressed concern with Loo's eyes and booked us in for another 2 months. She discussed surgery and the possibility of having to do it soon. I am fine with that. It's best for Loo, and that's what we want.

She discussed putting in lenses that would change her from near to far sighted, but over correcting so she would be very far sighted. This would allow Loo to, grow into them?, and slowly become less far sighted.

My wife wants to discuss removing the lenses and waiting for a few years, as she did. I am fine with this as well.

Could anyone tell me pros and cons of either of these plans? I am not looking to have my mind set before the next appointment, but it would be nice to have some advice, wisdom, sage gems of knowledge, instead of stressing for the next few months.

We would have asked today, but Loo was in the room with us and once she heard about surgery kind of panicked.

Also, are there now better lenses for glasses so she wouldn't have to have bottle bottoms for lenses, as my wife did?

TLDR: 5 yr old will have cataract surgery sooner rather than later, tell me things to inform me about surgery at this age.

bgnqjp,Had strabismus surgery about two months ago to fix my diplopia. It's now come back and even worse. What do I do?,"Hi all. About two months ago I went through strabismus surgery to fix my double vision that has been making my life extremely inconvenient and miserable at times for years. Prior to the surgery, I wore prism glasses for about two years, but decided to go for the surgery because I wanted to be done with the problem once and for all. The surgery fixed both my strabismus and double vision for a few weeks, but as I am writing this the double vision has reappeared and is now even worse than before. From looking at myself in the mirror I can tell that the strabismus has come back too, and it also seems worse than before. I went to my doctor's, who recommended me for a month-long treatment of looking at shit on a computer screen with 3D glasses, and honestly I feel like it's making the problem worse. (I am currently in a country where the doctor-patient ratio is much worse than the western world, and getting an appointment with an ophthalmologist is a living fucking nightmare.) 

This is a long shot, but I feel more and more desperate and cheated out of my money every day since the problems have come back. I already have to stare at screens for many hours a day to stay productive, but I force myself to take eye breaks every half an hour or so. What should I do?

bgqfh7,Please help! Strange eye problem I can’t find answers to is ruining my life,"So I have this really strange and frustrating vision problem. I was told I had amblyopia (lazy eye that doesn’t turn in) and eye muscle weakness  back when I was 10. This was fine for awhile after I went to vision therapy, but within the past 3 years it’s gotten worse. 

I would always feel like I saw through some type of dark see through shadow through my right eye if I closed the left one. However, the left eye was always good. It seems to have gotten worse over the past 3 years. It’s very important to note I had a neck fracture that was left untreated for 2 years and ended up having c1-c2 fusion neck surgery in July 2017. This neck surgery is supposedly successful as the bones have fused and I’m not in pain. However this seems to be getting worse.


I have seen 3 eye doctors including a neuroopthamologist to examine my eyes. My optic nerve was healthy, my retina was examined, every test was done but I still feel like this weird sensation is affecting my vision. It’s very hard to describe but it literally feels like pressure mostly in the left eye and feeling like I’m looking through a see through screen where things feel farther away. Nothing is blurry or double. 

My surgeon says vision isn’t connected to where my injury was but I did have years of micro damage to the area. I would think maybe this issue is from my neck issues but it seems so strange that it seems similar to things I’ve had as a child that I just don’t know what this could be. I can’t find anything on good except maybe amblyopia. I can still read 20/20 but I feel like my vision gets darker when I close one eye and depth perception / low light vision is worth. 

I had a brain MRI and it was thankfully clear. Could it have been wrong? What else could this be?

Im sorry if I'm using incorrect terminology, but I'm trying to ask about the inside of the eyelids and specifically the inside of the lower eyelid. Should it be uniformly pink or are white patches normal too? My Google images search shows a wide variety of results so I thought I might ask on here. 

My eyes for the past 4 months have gotten increasingly uncomfortable: they feel tight like I've been crying all day, they feel slightly dry, and hurt like an achey pressure. No redness or obviously swelling, and no itching or discharge. It is becoming increasingly worse. My opthomologist says it's allergic conjunctivitis due to my contacts, and she prescribed me ketorolac drops and I use artificial tears a few times a day, which have barely helped. She just keeps telling me that my eyelids aren't dry, they're inflamed. I stopped wearing contacts 4 months ago as well. I will add that I have posterior uveitis and retinal vasculitis as well as Hashimoto's disease and I am currently on oral prednisone. Is there some autoimmune related disease that attacks the conjunctiva like this? OCP? I know it's very rare, especially for my age (20, F) but I already have 2 autoimmune diseases and one is a rare eye disease. I have attached a picture of my lower eyelid. This is becoming increasingly unbearable and my next appointment with my uveitis specialist isn't for 2 weeks.

Several minutes ago, the bottom third of my left eye field of vision suddenly went gray -- not impervious to light, but, I think, obscuring my vision. A few minutes later, it went away; but this has never happened before.

I used to be diabetic, but haven't been for years. I am a transgender female taking estrogen, which does marginally increase my risk for blood clots, so I suppose it's theoretically possible I've had a stroke? But it wouldn't be my first thought.

1) I have been using the Refresh Optive preservative free eye drops with the Omega 3 for about a month now, and I always taste it after I put them in. Recently my throat has been getting kinda sore and I think it is the eye drops (this did not happen for the first 2 weeks of using them though) Has anyone seen this or have any tips about how to avoid this kind of problem? I have tried some things to avoid the drainage of the drops into my throat (keeping my eyes closed for a few minutes, pinching my nose near the corner of my eyes) but nothing is really helping and I'm scared I'm going to damage my throat(is that even possible with these eye drops?).

2) I was told to do warm compresses with a Bruder mask, but is there really a difference between using one of these heat masks vs using a hot wet towel or rice in a wet handkerchief/sock? Should I buy the mask?

bichc6,Could/should my acute retinal detachment have been caught sooner?,"I (39M, writing from the UK) am very short sighted (-7) and have therefore been warned frequently that I am at high risk of retinal detachment. When I started seeing flashing lights and blurriness at the edge of my vision I went straight to A&amp;E. By the time I was seen, the flashing lights had subsided, but there was still something wrong with my vision, though I was struggling to say exactly what. I was also experiencing some non typical sensations - not exactly pain but something clearly out of the ordinary. My eyes were examined, but with inconclusive results. I was advised to report to the local eye emergency centre as soon as it opened the next day, which I did.

During this second examination I was told that I had a ""chronic retinal detachment"" which had been ongoing for some time, and was unlikely to be the cause of the symptoms I had experienced, which were most likely migraine related (though I have never suffered migraines previously) . This was based on the location of the flashing lights in my field of vision, and the pictures of them I picked out from a line-up. Once I knew where to look in my field of vision, I was able to see a small shadow on that edge of my vision which wasn't there on the other side.

Reassured that my condition was not urgent, I went home with the understanding that a follow up appointment would be arranged for me with a retina specialist. However, before that happened, on the third day after my previous appointment, I woke up with a black curtain across more than half of my field of vision in the same eye. Obviously I returned to the emergency eye centre, where I was diagnosed by a different doctor with an acute retinal detachment. I was warned that, because my macula was detached, I would likely suffer permanent impairment to my vision. The next day I had a vitrectomy and gas tamponade surgery, from which I am now recovering.

The reason I am posting here is that, I have some concerns over whether the correct decision was made when I was first diagnosed with a chronic retinal detachment, and I am not clear how to resolve these concerns one way or the other. During that meeting, there was a long silence during which the doctor seemed deep in thought. I prompted him and he said that he was wondering whether to send me to see a retina specialist that day. Obviously he decided against it. It seems like that moment  was possibly pivotal, and a different decision might have resulted in the surgery happening before my macula was impacted, leading to a much better outcome. Note that I don't dispute that I had a CRD. I'm just not convinced that that was the only thing going on that day. 

I've tried to raise this with the doctors who saw me prior to surgery. The story that I am getting is that the ARD happened after the pivotal meeting with the emergency eye doctor. I find that a little bit difficult to square with the quite profound symptoms I was experiencing - even if they don't totally match what is expected in my case, it's hard to accept they were an unrelated coincidence.

What I am trying to figure out is, whether  more could have been done earlier. Obviously I don't have the expertise to figure that out myself, and the specialists I now have access to all know the doctor in the pivotal meeting. I have no reason to doubt their honesty, but obviously it's hard to view their opinion of their colleague's decision as totally unbiased.

Here are some concrete questions that I have, which I realise you probably can't give concrete answers to. I really haven't prejudged the answers. 

Is it plausible that I had an ARD so shortly after being told I did not have one?

If its likely that my initial symptoms were caused by or a prelude to the ARD, should this have been caught during my first examination, or is this a case where the diagnostics are just too difficult to do accurately?

What if anything should I do next? I'm reluctant to involve a solicitor, partly because I'm worried that it is in their interest to encourage me to take legal action, regardless of whether that is the correct route for me. Is there some way that I can speak to an independent medical person? How would I go about this? Given that it's after the event, are they likely to be able to give me any further clarity?

FWIW I have no desire to make this doctors life difficult. I'm just scared that, if this were to happen to my other eye the repercussions would be devastating to me and my family, who are highly dependent on my income. If that happens then, the decisions that were made in my recent past may turn out to be life changing.

biz0wx,Do ophthalmologists typically read MRIs or only the report?,"I have an ophthalmologist who I will be seeing soon.

bjme3t,Transient visual disturbances,"* Pertinent History:  

* 25yr old female
* Severely impaired vision in R eye, normal vision in L eye (uncorrected is 20/40, worsening with age)
   * Impairment present at birth and went untreated, now considered legally blind in R eye but can see large objects, bright, dark, etc
      * Of note, vision in R eye seems to be getting better over time, unsure if actually true as I only ever get told it's blind and that testing cannot tell acuity of this eye.
   * R eye impairment means I'm L eye dominant and as such generally don't receive much visual input from R eye
      * HOWEVER, I have a 15yr history of double vision caused by r/L eyes not working together. Double generally only bothersome when fatigued or following concussion/s
* No other known eye disorders
* No personal history of neurological, endocrine disorders with the exception of hypothyroidism
   * I have gotten a concussion before, possibly multiple. A few years back I hit my head pretty hard and had all the classic symptoms of concussion and was diagnosed with a mild concussion. Since then I have hit my head a few other times (fast paced work, lots of hazards, and impaired peripheral vision will do that to you) and have had two additional instances of long standing persistent double vision following smacking my head on something. 

&amp;#x200B;

Current issue:  


* In August of last year I experienced a loss of central vision. Onset was slow and it wasn't noticed until I realized I was unable to read. I was at work at the time and took a break and my vision was restored within about 30-40minutes. No other symptoms noted. I took my BP at the time and it was normal.
   * Best way to describe it is it's as if I have a black disk floating in the center of my vision.
* I have now had about 6-7 similar episodes with most lasting about 40 minutes until full resolution. 
   * During the worst episode I had total loss of vision on right side.
* I saw my eye doctor and primary care practitioner, they believed it to be caused by ocular migraines and suggested I get off hormonal contraception due to increased risk of stroke. I have gotten off my birth control since then and have noticed that the episodes aren't as frequent and are not as severe.
* Now, **this is the biggie**, I have noticed that I will seemingly randomly get a dark cloud over the central portion of my right eye, if that makes sense. The 'migraines' were complete black disk blocking out all central visual input while this is kind of like a black shade dulling/dimming central visual input primarily in my right eye. These episodes are random and are unlike the 'migraines' as I cannot exactly say when they start or stop and they do not impair me really.

He told me what I had was a rare eye disorder that usually happens to healthy, young female. It's something to do with the immune system fighting something in the eyes. It has a rather long name, if I recall correctly. There is no treatment for this, it just goes away by itself; however, it takes a long time (weeks to months). In my case, I gained back my vision 100% after around 3-4months.

bjyy3a,Adie's Syndrome 44F,"I have posted before about my visual disturbances (blurry vision, flashes, after images, extreme light sensitivity, etc.) following my first migraine with aura 6 months ago. I have seen several specialists and have had a battery of tests...all negative. Since I had never heard of a migraine aura, the experience was terrifying. I have since developed a bit of anxiety related to all things vision related (i.e. eye drops that change the size of your pupil). 

Today, at the neuro-ophthalmologist, I thought I was having a three month checkup since being prescribed glasses. She walked in the door, asked about my vision and then told me I needed to have, ""Adie's drops."" I said I could not have anything like that done to my eyes because I had to go to work right after. She assured me there were no side effects, but also said it would take 60 minutes after the drops. I said, I couldn't do that because I had to work.

bksk1r,Worried about my ENT and now eye symptoms,"I'm at the tail end of a 2-week vacation in Greece, of which I've been feeling sick the past 7 days or so. Initially I thought maybe it was allergies so I bought some Clarityne-D and took ibuprofen for sinus pressure/headache. No fever, no chills, just an itchy throat and nasal congestion. Fast forward to yesterday, I went to see an MD because I was worried since my sickness had persisted to almost a week, my congestion was getting worse, and I thought maybe my ear was infected. My ear wasn't feeling that sharp pain like from an infection after swimming in questionable water, but the pressure was very uncomfortable. I did not feel like the MD I saw was very though (plus slight language barrier)-- he took my temperature (under my axilla-- is that accurate for adults too?), it was 37.5C. Didn't use a stethoscope (I am now worried about bronchitis). Doctor gave rx for 1) Azithromycin 500mg, 3 tabs, 3 days; some 2) nasal saline solution (that I was already using 2 days prior) and 3) Panadol Cold and Flu per box instructions. 18 hours after I took my first azithromycin pill, I started to feel the beginnings of conjunctivitis. Tearing up, sensation of something stuck in my eye, yellow thick discharge at edges of eyes and lashes. My ear pressure was better. I've now taken the second Azithro pill and just woke up with crusty, yellow gunk consistent with conjunctivitis. I would go back to the MD I saw but I left that island and am now in Athens until Tuesday. I am super uncomfortable, waking up every 1.5 hours, applying warm compresses to de-crust my eyes, blow my nose, hack out thick yellow mucous :(( my nose is super crusty, yellow despite drinking lots of water and following doc's orders. I feel a slight fever too but not too bad.
My questions are:
1) should I assume my illness is not of bacterial origin if my conjunctivitis does not resolve in the next few days?
2) besides resistance, are there contraindications to using a separate antibiotic in drop form for my eyes? If not, what abx drops should I get?

bkz590,Light flashes after silicone oil surgery,"I had scleral buckle surgery on my left eye early April due to a possible retinal detachment. Prior to surgery, I was not experiencing any symptoms to my knowledge. The hole was only found after a routine eye appointment, apparently it's been there for almost a year.

A week surgery, I started seeing light flashes. I told my optometrist at my two-week post-op because my surgeon is only on island two weeks every couple of months. She didn't think it was a problem but I made an appointment with an ophthalmologist. He referred me to another retinal specialist only on island for the week. I saw the specialist that day. He did a laser treatment the next day then scheduled surgery for the day after.

I had the surgery for silicone oil insertion on the over a week ago. He told me to lay on my right side or face down for a week. I saw the specialist for my post-op the day after surgery and my ophthalmologist 5 days after. They said I was healing well.

Flash forward to today and I started seeing the light flashes again. They are exactly what I saw before the oil surgery. The specialist won't be back until June and I have an appointment for the 17th. My ophthalmologist scheduled me for August.

I apologize for the long post but I don't really know what's going on. I've had two surgeries on the same eye in one month. The specialist who did my scleral buckle advised against the laser due to the risk in creating more tears. I was supposed to see him on June 3rd for another post-op but the specialist who did the laser and oil told me to cancel.",2,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/bkz590/light_flashes_after_silicone_oil_surgery/"")",2019-05-05 08:40:21,
bkz5yp,Sensation of Something Stuck,"Hi r/eyetriage! I'm stoked this sub exists, I've been having some trouble and I'll take any advice at this point. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, I went to get new contacts. After wearing them for one or two days (following the directions) I noticed pain under my left eyelid as if something was stuck in there. I discontinued use of the contacts, went back to the ophthalmologist who said he saw scratches and irritation but nothing stuck in the eye. He prescribed me gel tears and I used them for a period of about 10 days which minimized the sensation, but never made it fully go away. I went back and saw the ophthalmologist again and they gave me gel tears. I can only feel it when my eye is closed and I move my eye under my eyelid or I blink, so I stopped noticing it for a while and went on about my life. It has been minimized surely, but never gone fully away. A few times it would come back for a few weeks and be more present, but would go away eventually. 

&amp;#x200B;

It started to eventually come back so I went back to a better ophthalmologist who did a more thorough inspection of my eye. She noticed irritation again but this time looked under my eyelids and confirmed there wasn't anything stuck. She mentioned she found a ""divot"" on the inside of the eyelid, but wasn't sure it was what was causing the sensation. She prescribed me 1% prednisolone suspension eye drops 3x a day and blink gel tears 4x a day for 10 days and mentioned the next step would be to have the divot biopsied if the drops don't work. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's day 3 and there's been absolutely no change thus far. Does anyone have a suggestion for the next step to escalate this issue? What sort of specialist should I see? I have good insurance and I'm not opposed to anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Quick facts:

* I wear glasses, my previous prescription caused the same eye to ache, but the pain would subside when I took my glasses off and let my eyes relax. I got a new prescription a few days ago, and I believe the ache is gone
* The pain seems to stay in the same place. I only feel it against my eyelid with a closed eye.
* I have read the gel tears and warm compress post, and started warm compresses today in addition to the eyedrops. 
* I am currently not wearing glasses and trying to let my eyes relax (could my glasses be causing this pain?) for at least the entire day today.

bl7fzv,Unresolved issue after seeing retina specialist,"I never had the worst eye sight, but was squinting a lot in school and got fairly weak prescription. About a year ago (sometime around the eclipse and I got super aware of my vision) I noticed my left eye seemed blurry. I saw multiple optometrists and ophthalmologists who could not get my left eye to 20/20 (sitting at 20/40). My ophthalmologist listed it as a macular pucker and sent me to a retina specialist. They did an OCT and checked the blood flow in my eye, and found zero problems, and attributed the blurry vision to my antidepressants. Its been a year and I got a new script and still notice the blurriness throughout the day. Things seem less bold and a different size when just looking through the left eye.

blfu5u,Hi. I am having another different eye issue.,"Hello, I have been having eye issues for newr 6 months now. A lot of the symptoms I was getting have stoppee or gotten somewhat better (I was seeing floaters before and I don't nearly see them as much and my left eye was very blurry). I saw opthamplogists three times who found nothing wrong with my eyes

Anyways I am still having two issues. I am not sure if this was always the case and I just never noticed. 
1. If I cover my right eye, and look facing forward, i can see for a full image for a little bit, but then my eye seems to not focus and  part of my vision in my left eye fades to black, and I can only see like a little hole of what im looking at. (Say I am looking at a word, I will see that and some of the space around it will be black).  If I like refocus I suddenly see everything but then it fades back to black again quickly. Its worse if i cover my eyes without my glasses on. This doesn't seem to happen if i cover my left eye. It sounds weird but its disconcerting to me

2. When watching tv or playing a game as examples. Its hardcto me to focus on multiple things happening at once on the screen. For example, I was watching star trek and 3 characters were on screen. I could focus on one of the characters, but the others I couldn't make out any details. I don't know anymore if this is normal and now that im having eye problems Im only just noticing it, or maybe there is some sort of problem

As a bonus 3. It feels almost as if my left eye is looking more to the left when im staring forward at something. I thought maybe I had a lazy eye or something but according to people I know they don't notice anything and it makes it feel like my glasses frames don't fit me anymore and I keep adjusting them. 

I don't really know what to do and Im at my wits end honestly. If i go back to a opthalmologist they are just gonna tell me there is nothing wrong with my eyes

bljyes,Traumatic Hyphema and Flying,"First off I know that this can’t be take as medical advice. So no worries there.

A little over three years ago I was in an accident that caused a severe traumatic hyphema. I was in bed rest for 9 straight days with little movement. My vision is slightly worse in my eye now and I wear glasses daily to prevent another injury that could be life altering. 

For years now, because of this injury I’ve been anxious about flying. I travel frequently for my job and while I’ve had plenty of flights now with zero problems yet there is always this nagging fear in the back of my head that somehow the flights are effecting my eye. Is this completely irrational? Last time I saw my ophthalmologist he said that if anyone were to look at my eye they wouldn’t be able to tell I ever had an injury. 

I guess at the end of the day I’m just looking to have a little extra peace of mind when I travel. Because of this fear of flight affecting my sight I have limited my wife and I’s travel dreams. It’s affecting her now which really bothers me. 

So if anyone can help me clear this up, if there actually is a risk or if it’s all just in my head. Once again I know I can’t take this as professional advice.

bln96t,Corneal Tattooing for glare relief and PRK - Before or After?,"Hi All,

I'm in a bit of a mixed situation here so I was wondering what the consensus here is.

So I plan on getting a corneal tattoo redone. This time I want to discuss the femto-assisted method as I heard it has less risk of touch-ups being required as opposed to the stromal puncturing (which also hurt pretty badly during healing lol).  

So the reason for the tattoo is because I have really signifiant glare from the Visian-ICL procedure which required an iridotomy (mine is at the 12 o'clock position).  The tattooing I did last year basically reduced the glare like 90%ish and I was very happy.  Unfortunately a year later, the glare is slowly getting worse and worse each month - almost back to where we started :(

I want to get PRK done in my other eye if the surgeon agrees it's safe (it has keratoconus).  My left eye (visian-ICL eye) does not have keratoconus but has the residual astigmatism.  


Here is my RX 

OD: SPH = -4.75, Cyl = 3.50 Axis = 165
OS SPH = -2.00 Cyl = +1.75 Axis = 080

So here's where I stand - Overall if I fix the glare Ill be content because my vision isn't too bad aside from the glare.  It was much worse before so I can manage.  

Im wondering though - if it is possible to perform corneal tattooing at the same time as PRK or if that requires a separate procedure.",3,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/bln96t/corneal_tattooing_for_glare_relief_and_prk_before/"")",2019-05-06 23:21:35,
blnfo4,Bright spots turn into dark ones,"Hello, I want to finally visit an eye specialist soon. But before that I wonder if someone can explain me how this symptom is called or what it might could mean.

&amp;#x200B;

Since being a child, I sometimes and totally randomly see very bright dots in different sizes flashing up. Not a lot, but they can differ in brightness and size. The thing is I read a lot about these flashes, but what is different from me, from what I found online so far is, that these dots do change.

&amp;#x200B;

When they appear, they are like when you get blended by a flashlight, but way smaller and super bright, it doesn't matter if I look on bright or dark background. But then they will slowly fade into a pitch black version of it, like literally black-hole black. and then shortly after that it disappears completely. All this maybe does take around 10-20 seconds, some are shorter some stay longer. I have it kinda rarely, maybe once a week or smth (as a child it was more frequent, but became less).

&amp;#x200B;

As a background info, as a kid I burned my eyes (kinda) because I looked for to long into a reflection of sunlight. I saw some orangish cloud for a while and went to a doctor. Which said it was harmless and will go away. Which it did. But now I fear that these dots could be related to this?

I did not have trauma, diabetes, did not take steroids and I undergone all autoimmune and genetic tests and everything came back clear. 

I was diagnosed with cataract only in my right eye. 

In February-March 2019 I was diagnosed with right subcapsular opacity (cataract) and uveitis. I had no symptoms other than blurred vision which i noticed sometime in February. Topical steroids did not work. On 26 April I had an Ozurdex implant to treat uveitis and was told that it is working.

Now on 17 May I am due to undergo cataract removal operation. I am 32 y/o and always had perfect vision. Never needed glasses or anything. This week I was shocked as I was told by my ophthalmologist that I will need glasses for short distance after the op. This is because he is implanting a monofocal lens focussed for long distance. I was not told this prior to my treatment. For some reason I believed that my vision after the op would be the same as prior to cataract and my doctor did not tell me otherwise. I really need my short distance vision as I work with the computer and documents, so a lot of reading. I would do anything not to have to wear glasses, especially for another 10-20 years. I enquired about multofocal lens and my doctor said that he does trifocals and would not recommend it to me. My operation is in 10 days and I still have time to change my mind/demand multifocal but have no idea what is best for me. All I know I do not wear glasses and would prefer to stay this way.

Now due to the cataract i have some double vision (right eye only) and glare around the lights and it does not bother me too much.

I would be very grateful for any advise what lens if most suited in my situation.

blwban,Recurrent erosion," 

I’ve been dealing with recurrent corneal erosions on my right eye for almost a year, my first erosion was in July 2018, I’ve had recurrences every 2-3 weeks on average, all of them have been upon waking up. 

The largest erosion I've had was 6mm in diameter (Picture), every time I’ve had an episode it is accompanied by blurry vision, increased vascularity under the eyelid, slight palpebral pain and chalazions (more common in the lower eyelid than the upper 80%/20%). 

Recovery from large erosions have always involved a therapeutic contact lens and Tobramycin 0.3% / Dexamethasone 0.1% drops for 2 weeks. On smaller ones after a few hours the pain is gone and no treatment other than lubricant drops was necessary.

To date I’ve had 3 stromal punctures and every time after recovery the thickness and pressure of the cornea have returned to the levels of my left eye and the epithelium has regained its stability (no problems on left eye, just a little dry on the mornings).

I wake up every morning with extremely dry eyes. I need to wake with my eyes shut and loosen my eyelid with Thealoz drops as it is sometimes completely adhered to the eyeball. The times I’ve suddenly waked up or when I didn’t loosen the eyelid properly is when I get an erosion. 

In between erosions my treatment has been and currently is: Eyelid hygiene with belphaclean wipes on the mornings, Thealoz 3% drops every 2 hours, and Muro 128 ointment before going to sleep.

Any suggestions on what the root cause can be?

Any other treatment ideas I can share with my ophthalmologist will be highly appreciated!

bly9jq,30 years old and 3 Weeks Post-Op Cataract Surgery.,"Hello all, last year around December 2018 right before my 30th birthday I abruptly started having glare on the left side of my visual field, intense photo-sensitivity  and blurry vision. I mean it was as if I had a glare on the left side of my visual field constantly.  After seeing two ophthalmologists, it was confirmed that I had a cortical cataract in my left eye. It was in a shape of a snowflake right in the middle of the lens in my left eye. I decided to take 4 months to see if I could live with this without surgery but when it progressed to the point where I could barely drive due to glare and really bad light sensitivity to headlights I decided it was time for surgery. The first ophthalmologist that I saw thought he saw a hint of a cataract forming in my good eye and the second one says she can't see anything at all. I am currently 3 weeks post op and is still having a lot of issues with adjusting to my vision. I am having headaches and flickering in my surgery eye when something is too close to my face or when the light catches it a certain way, as well as when I look at a phone and I still feel like I see a glare on that side - I just wanted to see if this was normal and if these symptoms will subside. Also I was wondering if anyone knew whether or not it is possible to only develop cataracts in one eye since I am intensely dreading having to go through this again in my other eye.

It stopped when I took a 30 minute break (but obviously I cannot take breaks like that throughout the day). It also stops when I go home for the evening so it seems the computer is the catalyst. 

Is there anything I can do to minimize the twitching while using the computer?

bmsdj7,Concern about missed diagnosis of solar retinopathy and risk of early-onset macular degeneration,"**Story**: About two months ago, after an appointment with an ophthalmologist, I was waiting in the car while my brother was picking up lunch. In a completely absentminded state, I looked out the window and directly at the sun for at least 15 seconds before I realized what I was doing. This is with dilated eyes! I'm not sure how I tolerated looking at the bright light for so long, but somehow I did. To my very limited understanding of how the eyes work, it seems I did the equivalent (maybe worse?) of looking at a solar eclipse. Well, what I did next and have done up to this point is even more stupid. I struggle a lot with obsessiveness (one of my previous therapists suggested I might have OCD), and rather than admit my mistake and let it go, I looked at the sun again multiple times that day, maybe for 10-15 seconds each time, irrationally trying to convince myself it's not a big deal to ""glance"" at the sun (anytime I can think rationally, I know how undeniably dumb this is). The next day, my vision originally is okay (there doesn't seem to be a change in acuity, no obvious scotomas), but towards the evening, my eyes really hurt and I decide to sleep early. The following day, my eyes no longer hurt. I try to immerse myself in schoolwork to get my mind off this issue, but that only works temporarily. Several times over the next few weeks, that same damn obsessive thought pattern returns, and I end up having instances where I look at the sun for a couple of seconds at least (a lot of the time, it's looking at areas in the sky near the sun but not directly at the sun). My paranoia about developing solar retinopathy keeps growing, worsened by the feeling that my vision was growing duller, so I go visit my dad's ophthalmologist. I'm too embarrassed to bring up my concern about this self-inflicted solar retinopathy, so I say I'm there because I'm seeing more floaters than usual and experiencing more photosensitivity (this was the reason for my previous eye appointment, for which the ophthalmologist found nothing wrong with my retina/cornea). First, the assistant has me read letters off the chart. Right eye seems good, but I definitely struggled to read letters with my left eye. She even tells me, ""Your left eye is the weaker one, isn't it?"" She doesn't tell me my acuity with my left eye, and it never gets brought up for the remainder of the appointment. Maybe I should have brought that up? Then, I see the ophthalmologist and he looks at my corneas and retina, including the periphery, and says they look healthy.

So, that brings me here. These are the questions I have:

**Is it possible the ophthalmologist could have missed solar retinopathy on the routine exam, especially since I did not bring it up at all in my history? It seems like OCT is the most sensitive machine for capturing damage from solar retinopathy, and I can't say for certain this was performed at my appointment.**

**Is it possible for a scotoma to be so small that I can't even notice it? Or that it would be missed in an eye exam?**

**Based on the association between UV exposure and AMD, is it possible I significantly increased my risk of developing AMD during this time span? Could I even develop it at an earlier age now? My macula might have some small damage from this dumb sungazing, and as I age, the degeneration of my macula may manifest earlier? I couldn't find any research papers that followed a patient with a concern of solar retinopathy long-term to see if they developed macular degeneration.**

**Should I schedule another appointment with an ophthalmologist? It would be my third one in the last 90 days.**

I would really appreciate your insight on this. This has been causing so much anxiety for me, and I'm struggling really hard to think and act logically with this issue. It's getting to the point where I'm honestly fearful of being outside or even near a window when the sun is out. I'm scared of developing early onset AMD. I'm going to be in school for several years before I can start working, and the idea of ending up disabled before I can earn an income and support myself terrifies me. I plan to visit a therapist to discuss this issue soon. I know I desperately need to end this obsessive habit before it causes (further) damage.

bmzouh,"Please help. Conjunctivitis I'm struggling with for 2 years, reasons unknown","Hello. I've been at doctors dozens of time and it didn't help me AT ALL. I will be very grateful to anyone who can give a piece of advice. Skip to TL;DR if you don't want to read this wall of text.

My medical issues:  

high miopia (had it from 12 years) now my eyesight is -5,5 and -7,0, retinal dystrophies (I had LASIK year ago), sinusitis (I had it until I was 18, now it's gone), seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff), left-sided scoliosis, conjunctivitis of unknown reason,chronic gastroduodenitis, dysbacteriosis (gone, probably?) and reactive pancreatitis, helicobacter pylori ++ (now it's gone), bladder stone + some kind of infection in my urinary system, I still didn't figure this out

  
It all started 2 years ago, at summer 2017. I've eaten a lot of junk food recently (candies, snacks. chips, soda, you name it). Never had any issues with my stomach. I played a lot of games like spinz.io and recently I started to feel some bluriness in my eyes and some kind of burning. It only get worse- every day I had pus in my eyes that became hard, especially at the morning, sometimes it took time just to open my eyes or help of a wet napkin.  

I am not allergic to dust (greer H1), I am not allergic to my cat (dermatophagoides pter D1, dermatophagoides farinae D2). I have not demodicosis in my eyes, I also checked chlamydia, ureaplazma, mycoplazma, macoplazma, because doctor said so and I have problems with urinary system- all negative. One result I got was st.epidermidis in my left eye (that's weird, because I've got problems with both of my eyes) but when I checked it in different clinic, there was nothing.

I've tried dexamethasone, indomethacin, oftalmoferon. I've discovered retinal dystrophies later in 2017 and I've had LASIK. Yes, they have operated on my eyes with conjitctivitus. I know.

Maybe I am allergic to something but I can spend my whole time searching for the reason. Yes I have dust in my room (because I have a small library) but well, I've got for my entire life. There's also pretty dry air in my room.

I think it somehow connected with my stomach issues (I have chronic gastroduodenitis, dysbacteriosis and reactive pancreatitis, ICD-10 K58.9), I also noticed that my eyes get worse when I eat something I shouldn't. I am trying to eat less junk food, but my eyes are still wet and I have snot from time to time (it's not sinusitis, I have very clean x-ray of my nose).

After I had courses of Nolpaza, De-Nol, Ermital, Alfa Normix, Klacid, Metronidazole (pantoprazole, rifaximin, bismuthate tripotassium dicitrate, amoxicillin, josamycin, clarithromycin) I've got better, I have no more pus in my eyes, but I still have burning in my eyes, tears (it's weird but it often happens when I go outside) and some kind of fog or blurriness in my eyes. Sometimes I wake up with my stomach hurt. I can't watch movies, especially in cinemas, or read books because I feel very uncomfortable. From time to time I've got my knuckles turn red, I don't know.

I am just so tired and want this blurry vision to go away. What could it be? I think it could be 1) Reiter's syndrome or 2) meibomian gland dysfunction.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Can't find the reason for my conjunctivitis. Could be connected to my stomach issues (gastroduodenitis and reactive pancreatitis), I am not sure. Don't think I have an allergy, tried different kinds of eyedrops- didn't help. All analises are clear. My guess is it could be 1) Reiter's syndrome or 2) meibomian gland dysfunction.",1,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/bmzouh/please_help_conjunctivitis_im_struggling_with_for/"")",2019-05-10 08:30:31,

bn2iqn,Need to mix and store eye drops at home but want to make sure everything remains sterile,"A few months ago I developed really bad floaters in both eyes. Easiest solution I found online is to use very diluted dilating drops so that my eyes will dilated enough to not see the floaters but still allows to see normally. My doctor decided it would be ok to prescribe me the drops and told me to use artificial tears to dilute them with. I kept trying to ask him and the other techs how they recommend I mix them but they basically just told me they don’t know and to ask the pharmacist. Anyways I figured that it wasn’t a big deal then how I did it, but when I got to the pharmacy and asked him what he suggested he said I should not try it at all because I could risk infecting my eyes if I don’t make sure everything is completely sterile. So here’s what I’m thinking: I would store them in a small glass jar. After I wash with soap and boil it, I’d squirt in all of the artificial tears and mix with a few drops of the other dilating drops. I also bought glass droppers which I can boil every time I need to use them. Is there any risk to doing this? I noticed the tears I bought don’t have preservatives but the prescription drops do.

bn6k3j,"Astigmatism developed quickly, floaters worsened","For a brief backstory, I had LASIK in 2014 in my late twenties and developed floaters immediately afterwards. They were mild at first, only noticeable against the sky. Otherwise LASIK corrected my vision to 20/20. (my original prescription was around -2.00 -1.75 with regular astigmatism in my left eye)

Fast forward 4 1/2 years later to summer 2018, my floaters suddenly got worse and more noticeable under all light sources. I basically see them all the time during the day now. Since last summer up until now, it's felt like my vision has been \*off\* .. it's been especially bad working on computers with the floaters and feeling eye strain, headaches, etc. The only other thing that happened to me around the same time the floaters worsened was a pretty severe neck pain caused from sleeping wrong. Likely completely unrelated but it was causing a lot of pressure / pain around my neck and head. 

I went to multiple ophthalmologists who checked my eyes for retinal tears, etc. when I first noticed my floaters worsened and they didn't find any problems. In my own research I did some eye tests online etc and noticed a bit of ghosting on an eye chart with one of my eyes. I booked an appointment with my optometrist and did some tests and low and behold I have astigmatism prescription in both eyes, correctable with lenses.

My question is, is it normal for someone in their early thirties to develop astigmatisms in both eyes in a relatively short period of time? I do spend a good amount of time on the computer, but even last year my eyes were tested at 20/20 without the astigmatism. Since it seems to be a regular astigmatism correctable with glasses I'm at peace wearing the glasses now but should I be worried this will progress?",1,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/bn6k3j/astigmatism_developed_quickly_floaters_worsened/"")",2019-05-10 18:34:38,

bnfjx1,Vitreous Detachment and Sports,"Hello!
I would like to get some advice from an expert. 


Last August I was diagnosed with PVD on one eye, with time and patience I got used to it and the symptoms almost vanished. On January however, I noticed that I was seeing more floaters and flashes and went to the doctor. He saw my eye and told me that in some spots the retina was starting to detach. He applied the laser and everything went back to normal, so to speak. 

Since then, I haven’t practiced any sport at all. 

One week ago I started playing badminton and now I wonder if this activity could turn my PVD into a retinal detachment. 

I am not particularly worried about getting a blow to the eye since I wear glasses, what concerns me is that I don’t know if this new strenuous hobby could jeopardize my eye. 

I read different opinions and it seems to me that there isn’t a consensus: some people write that one should avoid contact sports and weightlifting, other said that even running could be dangerous with PVD and then I also found one article where all kind of sports and weightlifting were permitted. 

Is there any specialist who could bring some light here?

bnft1a,Debris in eye post vitrectomy,"I had a couple of detachment events last year that culminated in a band being fitted and a vitreectomy performed, followed by silicon oil being left in for 7 months. When the oil was removed the vision was not perfect... there was a bunch of crap floating around in there... dead cells, a certain amount of residue of surfactant and so forth.

It is now 6 months on and the quality of my vision fluctuates from very good to marginal and I can't for the life of me correlate the fluctuations with any particular behaviour, physical activity, diet, water intake or anything else. I do know that when I am bent forward for a bit, the crap settles to the lowest part of my eyeball, thus causing a bit of increased blurriness and various floaters, but straightening up for a few minutes resolves this. The fluctuation I am talking about is the overall quality of the vision going from pretty clear to very foggy, and subject to a lot of blooming if I look into a light. I also get very distinct rainbow haloes from bright lights. The poor quality vision seems to last a day or so and then starts to improve, eventually returning to pretty clear good vision.  I get that the risk of trying to flush my eyeball causing another retinal issue is more than any benefit might be worth, but I am wondering what the longterm prognosis for this might be, and if there is any known correlations between increased cloudiness &amp; other occlusions and behaviour, activity, diet etc.",1,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/bnft1a/debris_in_eye_post_vitrectomy/"")",2019-05-11 12:15:14,

So for some brief background, I got an eye check up after a scare with accutane, and found out that I have major astigmatism in both of my eyes. (Main thing bothering me was double vision.) Settled on a prescription that resolved it, and everything was fine. Set another appointment for two weeks later to see if my eyes would go back to normal after being off of accutane, and they remained the same. (I've since remained off of accutane.) 

Before the next appointment, I developed a strange flashing blue arc in the peripheral vision of my right eye. Similar to a scotoma, except that it was flashing blue in response to bright lights, i.e transitioning from darkness to a lit room, etc. It would even flash in response to loud noises. (Only noticed this with my eyes closed.)   


During my followup appointment, I described my symptoms to the eye doctor there, and he dilated my right eye and discovered a single cotton wool spot. However, he didn't seem to link the two together, and seemed very nonchalant about the whole thing in general. Only through researching for a few days afterward did I find a couple of obscure studies linking cotton wool spots to scotomas, and a reddit post of a woman complaining about something similar. (I got in touch with her and she said that her flashing/scotoma did resolve entirely after a few months.) 

In those studies, it was mostly a toss up on whether or not the scotoma went away for the patient. Some mentioned it resolved within 6 months, and a few of them implied that the symptoms remained for life. My scotoma doesn't flash blue anymore, and it's almost to the point where it's barely noticeable, but I'm not sure if that's because it's actually going away, or my brain is adjusting to the minor loss of vision. 

I've been working on getting my blood pressure down through exercise, and each day the scotoma seems to become less noticeable. So my question is... is there any point in even worrying about it?

bnmexp,What the heck is wrong with my eyes?,"I've visited a myriad amount eye doctors (both optometrists and ophthalmologists), and because of how exorbitant eye care is,  I am starting to become confounded. What the heck am I paying for? My eye doctors do a fine job with finding me 20/20 vision; however, from my perspective, they do not account for other variables that can affect my visual clarity and I don't understand why they just call it a day after finding me the what they think is the best prescription. They all seem to just dismiss my eye problems. I can see alright because I do have 20/20 vision with glasses, but my problem is that no matter what glass prescription eye doctors give me, I do not have the clarity I want and astigmatism is not entirely corrected. In fact, my vision is constraining and my quality of life has diminished as a result. I can't read as much (which is huge as someone that strives to be an intellectual), I can't play the piano as reading music becomes cumbersome and I have trouble appreciating anything visual (especially artwork or nature or even simply just watching a busy intersection of people walking by). So, I would greatly appreciate help as I did everything that I can, and since all my eye doctors did everything they can, I resort to the internet for any suggestions.

Here is my current prescription which was updated in April: 

 **Right (OD)**\-4.50-2.00+180.00

**Left (OS)**\-5.00-1.50+180.00 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I experience (even with my new eye prescription; again, it seems that no eye prescription seem to fix any problems - not even rgp contact lens):

 \- gradual worsening of blurriness over time when eyes are not opened all the way (happens a lot when I squint a lot...it makes me look tired but I'm actually not tired, just trying to use my eyes) 

\- when reading a book or looking at a smartphone at a downward angle, gradual worsening of blurriness

\- when I open my eyes and not squint, vision does not become blurry over time, but it's hard to actually use my eyes

\- when I open my eyes as wide as possible, I start to see double

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I know from what my eye doctors have told me: 

\- I hold back my vision a lot, and during eye exams, I am often struggling to differentiate between different prescriptions once it gets near to my current prescription 

\- I have Asian eyes and my eyelids apparently hold back astigmatism (questionable if this can actually happen)

\- My right eye is apparently weaker (In fact, an important thing to note is that I used to only use my left eye where I would partially close my right eye because of how much clearer I saw. I still see better with my left eye. Right eye is always a bit of a struggle) 

\- Also, my right eyelid seem to be weaker if that makes any sense....

&amp;#x200B;

My ultimate conjecture: 

\-I think it's because of the discrepancy between my two eyes, both visually and physically, that cause my brain to not be able to create a clear image.  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; No eye prescription or eye doctor seem to know what's wrong with my eyes and they all tell me that there's not much we can do. I refuse to believe that. What can I do?

bo9y43,I am scheduled for a endothelial corneal transplant for Fuch’s dystrophy and a cataract removal on July 2nd.,"I’m a 58 y/o female who started with blurry vision in my dominant eye (amblyopia in other eye), eye pain/eye feels “weak” or “weird/not right”, large brown/gray floater, poor peripheral vision in same eye Right eye. I am farsighted and my vision changes drastically from year to year. 

Glasses less than a year old. Had a bunch of tests at eye doctor including an OCT and field vision test. Everything was normal. 

Next was neurologist to rule out multiple sclerosis. (I’ve been an RN for 37 years. On disability for last 2 1/2 years. Diagnosed with fibromyalgia). MRI of brain with emphasis on Optic nerve was normal. 

Next to Opthalmologist for second opinion referred by neurologist. After looking at all tests, used yellow drops and diagnosed Fuch’s dystrophy with small cataract on right more prominent in the area of decreased peripheral vision. Was happy someone said I wasn’t crazy. 

I’m pretty nervous about the surgery because it is my dominant eye. My left eye didn’t take over d/t the amblyopia. MD said my vision won’t stabilize for one month. Since I’ve been sick, things take way longer to heal (i.e. root canal, took 8-10 months for gums to heal vs 2 weeks). I’ve read about bad outcomes. 

My rheumatologist freaked out and recommended another opinion even though he really knows and likes this cornea specialist. I’m moving ahead with the procedure. Dr. states that I have very little astigmatism in that eye, even though my glasses have a huge astigmatism correction in my glasses. I have trifocal progressive lenses. 

I have lost 45 pounds in the last year (on purpose). My other eye doctor also said my astigmatism had markedly decreased. (He has prescribed my eye glasses for years). Was told weight loss wouldn’t affect astigmatism. New doctor didn’t say much, but I felt like he wanted to say that my previous doctor didn’t know what he was doing.

bop6pn,Strong pain from blocked tear duct - 23 y/o male - do I need surgery?,"Hello -

I am a 23 year old male and I am on day 3 with an incredibly painful blocked tear duct.

It started Sunday morning and has since been getting slowly worse. Ibuprofen doesn't seem to help unless it's in large doses, and I got so fed up with the pain that I took a Tramadol. This is only a temporary solution, as I understand that opioids can be addictive, and it is not something I would've resorted to if the pain wasn't unbearable. On a scale of 1-10, the dull, aching pain is probably a 7-9, constant, and keeping me up at night.

I went to a general doctor yesterday and they suggested it was an infected blocked tear duct; they prescribed me eyedrop antibiotics, which I take every 4 hrs since yesterday.

I have been hot-compressing my left tear duct often, and massaging it often, for the past couple days, and it seems to make it better very temporarily but only for a few minutes, then the pain is back. When I heat compress it, I can feel a little bit of liquid leaking down the back of my throat.

I tried to go to the optometrist, but I can't afford it right now due to my high deductible. Plus, I was thinking that it could heal at any moment, which would make the incredibly expensive visit a waste of money.

Should i even bother with the optometrist at this point? The only thing that makes me want to go is the pain. It's keeping me up at night and I don't want to keep taking Tramadol for it.

Thanks! [Here is a picture of my eye.](https://imgur.com/kjHU8tQ) It's my left eye, which is the one on the right in this pic (phone camera flipped)

P.S. I've had this problem before.

He said its the gel in my eye moving around and didnt find any issue with my retina. Im also nearsighted and 25 yo,so he says its normal. Im just curious as to why its not going away or reducing. Also why is the gel doing this now and not before? When can i expect this to go away?

All day, even when I was not doing the above tasks that require lots of eye focus, my eyes have felt extremely tired and like I have to work so hard to focus. 

Now, this is not your standard case of eye strain and thats why I'm asking for advice. I have posterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis, myopia, astigmatism, and what my opthomologist says is allergic conjunctivitis that won't go away (started with ketorolac, currently using pazeo and preservative free artificial tears with no relief). At my last eye exam 2 weeks ago my VA was fine I think but idk if that has changed since then, and I see flashes and flickering in my eyes occasionally throughout the day. I also have many large floaters. Systematically, I have been diagnosed with Hashimoto's and we are investigating polycythemia. On prednisone and plaquenil. 

Honestly I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure which of my eye problems is making me so miserable at my new job. But my eyes feel exhausted all day and it gives me a headache. Before I started working my eyes would only feel this bad in the evening but I would be fine until then.

I'm on a combo eye drop called DuoTrav (Travoprost and Timolol) and my optometrist is pleased with my pressures since they dropped 50% (from 40 to now around 20). I have to see an ophthalmologist in a couple of weeks and my optometrist mentioned that he may add another drop or maybe the SLT, just to bring pressures down even more (considering I'm going to live to 100 and need to see until then!). It got me thinking about all the new procedures out there to treat glaucoma these days and I was wondering if I were to get the SLT if it would prevent me from getting say the iStent or another MIGS device. Perhaps even canaloplasty?

Also, what I've read says that the SLT could lower pressures by up to 20%. I'm assuming that's 20% of my current pressure (around 20) and not 20% of my highest pressure (40).

Also, just to add. My glaucoma is pre-perimetric and my fields are at 100% if that makes a difference. I was being monitored for the last 10 years with ocular hypertension and my pressures skyrocketed after having my second child. Not sure if the pregnancy did anything to influence that or not, but I am very fortunate that it was caught at this stage.

bq712h,Too late to wait 4 days to get my eyes checked ?," Hey there, I'm 21 year old male ,I'm healthy, I have been having many floaters and sparkles for a very long period of time and I had the last opthalmic exam about 5 years ago.I started getting these flashes of lights whenever I would blink that would occure when I wake up or change the room lighting. They are small , I guess black , dots that sparks when blinked and then they go away. They vanish or they're not noticeable when I'm in a constant room lighting. Yesterday I noticed that one of them is larger and located near the center of my right eye. If I close my left eye, I can see that there ( on that same spot ) is a gray spot, ovaly shaped. It is blurry and I cannot see through it if my left eye is closed. It's not always gray, actually it tends to pick up the color of the background . So if I'm reading something on the white background and if I close my left eye, the spot is white. I was also looking at the bright sky with my left eye closed and I have noticed that there are tiny wild sparkles on that spot, but I had to really focus my sight in order to see those sparkles. I don't see them, however, when I'm looking at the white background. I have a scheduled an ophtalmic exam in Tuesday, so four days from now.I should mention that I have occular migraines, usually 2-3 times a year (not diagnosed though ). BUT, I had 3 migraines last month which was very uncommon. Usually when I am about to have a migraine , I have visual disturbances in my central vision. Vision disturbances vary afterwards and last only for 30 minutes followed by headache which lasts for maximum of 2-3 hours, I guess. But I'm always prepared and I reduce the pain to its minimum, so I couldn't tell how much it would last if I wouldn't take the pill and close myself into a dark room. These syptoms I'm having at the moment are not the symptoms of ocullar migraine, but I figured there could be a connection, especially since I got 3 migraines last month. I also remember I had somewhat similar problem before with that spot in the center, but it was never this big and it would pass after a week or so.

I passed the VF test first go, my optic nerves look ''very good'' and cups are also normal. She turned her chair and said, you do not have glaucoma and said there is a very slight part in my left eye (near the optic nerve?), that is ''thinner than expected for someone my age, etc'' and was in the red zone in the OCT images in this small area. I questioned as much as I could, she explained this is not un-common, some people don't always meet normal criteria in every single aspect, and said come back in 12 months - ''not because she is concerned, but because it's in her best interest to be 100% with everything''. I was pretty calm but insisted I don't fully understand and would like the be told exactly what she is thinking and not leave me sugar-coated, and that I needed to know if I should be ''cautious/worried'' in these 12 months, but she told me no, there is no reason too and I left.

&amp;#x200B;

First thing's first, I have googled this stuff, but figured getting an opinion from actual eye professionals would be a better option than just automatically assuming the worst.

So over the last couple of weeks, I've been having mild eyelid twitching.  It feels like a sort of ticklish sensation, never tries to completely close, but just seems to spasm in place.  Usually lasts till I lightly massage it or until I blink a few times.  Annoying, but never really gets in the way.  In almost all cases, it has been the upper lid, though once in a while, I'll get a light twitch of the lower lid as well.  It doesn't happen nearly as often, and never lasts longer than a second.

I did see that some potential causes included poor nutrition and increased caffeine intake, but the thing there is, I've been actively cutting back on caffeine for over a year now in an effort to get more into shape.  It used to be I drank upwards of 60-80 oz. of sugary drinks per day.  Now I'm down to around 40 on a particularly unhealthy day.  I have also been eating better (though not by much, admittedly, as I'm still supremely picky), but I won't rule out both of those being possibilities; I just figured they'd be low-likelihood.

It has also mentioned that stress or fatigue could be causes, and over the last few months, I have been playing ice hockey, and have been increasing the amount of time per week that I play, but this problem appears to be far more recent, so I don't believe it's a cause.

Work isn't something I particularly enjoy, but all things considered, it isn't too stressful or tiring.  I do programming, so screen fatigue could play a part, but it seems to be happening even when I'm AFK (does that change anything?) or haven't been around a computer in some time.

One final possibility.  I haven't suffered any more trouble than usual sleeping lately (the odd early morning or late night aside), but the twitches seem to have coincided with around the time I switched out my bed slats, which I have noticed don't seem to support my weight all that well (they bend and my bed seems to dip down as a result).  Perhaps my sleep has become restless due to this and that's playing a part?

She gave me 0.09% sodium chloride drops and just said to use them. 

They were in those vials and looking back I really had no idea how to use them and I should have asked since she didn’t tell me.

Edit: I should said a few weeks after that I went to my regular ophthalmologist and he told me my eyes looks fine except it looks like I have some impermanent damage related to dry eyes in one of my corneas and told me to not wear contacts for a while and use eye drops more often and use a gel at night.

bruv45,So anxious about this spot in my vision that I could die,"# SYMPTOMS: 
- Episodes been coming and going since early September - just not as often 
- I will have 1-3 days where the opacity in this certain spot is much more noticeable, then it seems to disappear and fade away  
- It's more visible against a bright sky and when there's a lot of light
- It's also visible when there's a change in contrast - like the edge of a computer screen 
- I can also see this spot against a white background when it's very dark 
- Almost looks like I was staring at the sun for too long? 
- It is not noticeable against a busy background or room - very much like a floater. 
- This spot also disappears after I've had my eyes open for a while.
- It's visible when I blink - I can almost see the outline of the spot
- Spot seems to stay lined up in the same spot, but will move with my eyes 
- Starting in March I noticed sparkles in the spot 
- In my last episode I also noticed some weird moving patterns if I looked at the sky, but they disappear
- In March, I noticed that in the spot of the floater, there's some blurred / distorted vision. 
- If I look at blinds or siding against a house in my peripheral vision, it looks wavy 
- I tried the Amsler grid and the spot is outside of that. If I look at that with my peripheral vision, it 
- LOTS of anxiety about this. I've been struggling with anxiety quite a bit and this has made it worse. 
- Blood pressure is very high. On a waiting list to see a primary care. 


# TREATMENT: 
- I was seen in January and fully dilated and told it was a likely a floater - no danger 
- Fully dilated last Monday by an eye doctor  - was told it was a floater. Potentially Posterior vitreous detachment?  
- Went to the ER because I was afraid of a stroke and they did an ultrasound of the eyes and found no issues. Did not think I required more treatment and referred me to an ophthalmologist
- Saw an ophthalmologist Wednesday after going to the hospital and was told I needed to see a neurologist. Was fully dilated again.",1,7,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/bruv45/so_anxious_about_this_spot_in_my_vision_that_i/"")",2019-05-22 14:59:10,
brwdzf,Question about Nystagmus and hand coordinstion,"I'm a patient with congenital Aniridia inherited from my mother, the mutation on the pax6 gene doesn't only affect the iris, I also have severe near-sightedness, Nystagmus (which was worse until I was about 5-6 when I had correction surgery) and a bunch of other fun stuff like macular dysplasia. 

I have in my teens (currently 16 turning 17 in August) started to notice a slight tremor in my hands, especially when working close to the eye. Of course things like caffeine increases this tremor but I've been wondering: could this tremor simply be a everyday puberty issue, or could it perhaps be a sort of mechanical correction by the brain, trying to keep a hand steady in the visual field. Why I'm even considering this to be plausible at any level is since it significantly increases when the hands are closer to the eyes and could thus increase as a result of this supposed eye-to-hand coordination having to move the hand a greater relative distance to be in the eye's central field of view. 

Of course this is just a speculative rant from an engineering student who is in no way linked to the medical field besides being a patient. Any thoughts?",2,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/brwdzf/question_about_nystagmus_and_hand_coordinstion/"")",2019-05-22 17:19:22,
bs9x6b,"Multiple Retinal Bleeds, Am I contributing to them by being active?","I am a patient with extreme myopia with history of recurrent retinal bleeds over the past 10 year (I get one roughly every 1-2 years). I have also recieved multiple lucentis and avastin shots throughout this time. Each time I have a bleed, my vision gets worse. I am very slowly going blind.

I want to understand what I may potentially be doing to contribute to these bleeds. I'm not looking for medical advice, but more information to understand this eye disease.  
I'm a bit of an excersie junky and live a very active lifestyle. Every time I have a bleed, I notice the visual disturbances *when I am not doing anything strenuous*. Most of the time I am just sitting around and relaxing when these bleeds occur.  
I've asked my doctor, if I had a done a strenuous activity say 4 hours prior to a visual disturbance, if this activity 4 hours ago could have caused the bleed (maybe its bleeding slowly?). His answer was NO. If the strenuous activity caused the bleed, I should see the visual disturbance immediately, not delayed. That its not likely a slow bleed.  
I concluded that my active lifestyle wasn't contributing to the multiple bleeds, and thus I can go ahead and continue with my active lifestyle. If i'm going to go blind with the bleeds anyway, why bother chaning my lifestyle?  
But there is still the nagging thought maybe I am contributing to my own blindness...  
Can the incremental increase of blood pressure during exercise weaken the blood vessels over time, causing retinal bleeds to occur when I am not doing anything?  
Just wanted other thoughts on the matter so I can make a more informed decision if I need to make changes to my lifestyle.  
TLDR: Does the incremental increase in blood pressure during a strenuous activity weaken blood vessels in the retina over time, causing bleeds hours or days later when I am not doing anything and am relaxed?",1,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/bs9x6b/multiple_retinal_bleeds_am_i_contributing_to_them/"")",2019-05-23 16:39:27,

btfx9v,My eyes are so unbearably itchy and inflamed I feel like tearing them out. Please help me. I’m desperate.,"I am losing my mind.

**My Experience**

3 weeks ago I developed viral pink eye (or so I thought) in one eye. Redness, watery discharge, swelling, and intense itching. It sucked, but it seemed to be pretty standard.

After dealing with that for a week, it seemed to finally go away, but the redness and itching and swollen eyelids suddenly came back – in both eyes.

Every day I don’t know what state my eyes will be in when I wake up. One day they’re only slightly red and swollen, the next day they’re completely bloodshot and feel like they’re on fire.

The itch is absolutely insatiable. It’s hard to put into words how insanely itchy my eyes are. I could rub my eyes for an hour (I don’t, even though I want to) and it would make no difference. Rubbing, in fact, makes it worse. My eyes feel so itchy that it actually feels like intense physical pain. The fact that there’s nothing I can do to relieve the insane itching is giving me horrible panic and anxiety.

**Doctor Visits**

I have been to the doctor twice and have not found a solution. I have been given a referral to an ophthalmologist but it could be weeks before I hear back about an appointment.

**Allergies**

I have no environmental allergies (as far as I know). I was tested a couple of years ago and had no reactions to anything.

**What I’ve Tried**

- OTC antibiotic eyedrops (1 week)
- OTC allergy eyedrops (on and off for the last 2 weeks)
- OTC lubricating eyedrops (3 weeks)
- washing with diluted baby shampoo (1 week)
- washing with a Tea Tree Oil-based eyelid cleanser (1 week)
- oral allergy medication (a prescription version of Reactin - once, single tablet)
- hot compresses on my eyes
- doctor-prescribed antibiotic ointment (Erythromycin - 3 days)

Literally nothing has helped make the redness or itchiness go away. My eyes have not improved since starting the Erythromycin.

**My Best Guess**

I have no clue what’s wrong but I have a weird gut feeling about something really specific.

I am hoping my ophthalmologist can tell me whether or not this problem is due to an overgrowth of Demodex, the skin/hair mite that is suspected to cause rosacea. Neither of the general physicians I saw for this issue were familiar with this field at all.

I was prescribed topical Ivermectin (Rosiver) – a medication that fights Demodex mites – at my last doctor appointment for acne/rosacea and it has markedly improved my skin, which leads me to believe the issue may be connected to my eyes. I suspect that taking Ivermectin orally (which is a thing) would help my eyes as well, but neither of my regular doctors knew enough to weigh in on this. They both mentioned oral antibiotics for “advanced cases,” but did not prescribe them to me based on my current symptoms. Which... ok.

All that to say, I have now read a lot about ocular rosacea and how rosacea can affect both the skin and eyes (the eyes, meaning, blepharitis-like symptoms). I have read that eyes can be affected by Demodex mites, particularly the eyelashes.

It’s important for me to note, however, that I’ve never been diagnosed with either typical skin rosacea (mine presents more like acne than rosacea, but responds to a rosacea drug) or ocular rosacea.

**TL,DR**

I am at my wit’s end. My eyes are so insanely itchy and red and puffy, 24 hours a day. I can’t sleep. I can’t work. I can’t think about anything else. Social life is down the drain. I can barely leave the house. Nothing I’ve tried has helped, and I’ve tried a lot. I am essentially no longer functioning as a person.

I don’t know what to do. Please help me. I just want the itching to stop. I’m desperate.

btmipi,Second Duane Syndrome Surgery?," 

Hey all, I'm reposting this from the Duane's Syndrome subreddit because it's hardly active, and hoping at least someone here may have some insight.

I am type 1A, and when I was 16 I had my first surgery. The surgeon who had checked me out and operated on me had been seeing me since I was a baby and when I was 15 I started having issues and he told me to get testing done in my town before travelling to his city to have the procedure. Symptoms included: eye turning permanently closer and closer to the inner corner of my eye towards my nose to the point of there only being a sliver of sclera visible, daily headaches that progressed into migraines thrice weekly, double vision, extreme head tilt (I don't remember the percentage but he was surprised how much it had increased since my last meeting with him as a kid), temporary blindness/white vision (and the worrrrms), fuzzy vision, neck and back pain, you get the drift. They figured it was serious enough that they bumped me up on the waiting list from 2 years to 4 months (I live in Canada, wait times suck). Went in, had the procedure, and when I woke up I was told that the muscles were worse than they imagined and weren't able to do what they had set out to. My surgeon told me I would need a revision with him after about 8 years.

Well,

It's been 3 years and I'm starting to experience all of these symptoms again (minus the migraines, but those didn't come until very near the surgery date, and no double vision yet). I thought it was stress, reading, and screen use thanks to university life but now that I've been relaxing in summer for a whole month, I think it may be more than that. I drove for the first time in 10 months and had to pull over after 15 minutes because it was like an acid trip. I'm arranging an appointment with a local ophthalmologist to get things checked out but I fear that I'll have to get another surgery done or worse, pay a ridiculous amount for insanely prism'd glasses.

**TL;DR Has anyone had 2 surgeries done so close together (such as 3 years) or heard of an alternative to surgery? I only know of the glasses approach but it would be too straining due to the angle correction to wear very often... Do I suck it up and hope it gets better? Is everyone's DS like this or is mine just...annoyingly dramatic? I've never met another person with DS before so I haven't got another person to ask.

So he prescribed me some steroid drops to use twice a day for a week then daily for a week and those cleared me eyes right up.

btv6lk,Docs disagree on diagnosis; what do you see?,"[photos](https://imgur.com/a/mY2ulZF)
October 2018; I got up from watching a movie and when I turned on the lights my eyes were in intense pain. Within an hour my vision decreased to just shadows and was very uneasy on feet. I couldn’t feel the floor beneath me. My eyelids were swelled also. My eyes hurt to look anywhere but straight. Even closing my eyes hurt. Pain was worst when i looked top left and could feel a tugging sensation on the corner of my eye when I looked top left or right. Er said that it may be my optic nerve but they couldn’t test it as I couldn’t keep my eye open long enough for their gun to measure. (Eyes were very sensitive) I had no headache or pain anywhere except my eyes and only if I moved them from looking straight or closed them. I had had tingling in my hands/feet for years on and off. But the day before the tingling moved up and numbness set in and was constant for 24 hours before my eye problems. The numbness and tingling has been constant ever sense. 

My eyes have never been the same. Vision improved but stayed blurry (nothing was crisp anymore; and very light sensitive) Finally got into eye doc a month later; he saw retinal flecks and referred me to retina specialist and neuro eye doc. Pressures were normal. Neuro doc did vision field test and looked at my eyes told me that nothing is wrong that the blurry ness is from my migraines (even though it was 24/7) and that my symptoms would improve if I lost weight. Told me that my field of vision test the only way they could look like that is if I had one of 6 things but he thinks I just didn’t do it right so is discounting and not using it at all. Even tried to cancel my retina appointment. Thankfully he couldn’t as the first doc refused to pull the referral stating he still felt something was wrong and he saw flecks. Which 2nd doc didn’t see but also didn’t dilate eyes. He did refer me to a regular eye doc for some 7 day eye dilation test  but that doc didn’t think it needed to be done. Did the field of vision again and didn’t see flecks but said he can tell something is going on but he can’t figure it out and got my retina appointment moved up. 

Retina took photos; diagnosed me with retinal dystrophy and stargardts. Told me there’s nothing she can do and we will take photos every 6 months. 3 months later I had been noticing my vision getting alittle worse and I sort of ignored it. Then I went to take a photo and kept tapping my phone to get it to focus and got mad because the phone wasn’t focusing then it hit me it wasn’t my phone. My vision wasn’t just blurry far away. But now it was getting where I couldn’t read and couldn’t see up close. Went back to retina. She couldn’t take new photos as insurance only pays every 6 months for them but says she can see changes in my retina. I asked her what that means and she said I don’t know. “You are a puzzle that no one has the pieces too” she referred me to low vision. Low vision sees me and immediately doesn’t think I have stargardts. She noticed that i had bad tremors, and my balance is very unstable. She stated she didn’t think I have stargardts as it also affects my side vision also. She felt like it was neuro based. (Her report and diagnosis are on the photos too) 

When my vision changed the following week my fatigue got worse, I slept all day and was still tired; I had slurred speech; and when I walked I was very unstable. I started having pain around my ribs (like a tight band that would be turned alittle tighter every few days) I had an emg done and it was abnormal. I was also diagnosed with a foot drop. Last two days my left foot has developed varicose veins and has swelled up. 2 weeks ago I had “pink eye” but my eyelids swelled up and even the skin under my eye turned red and inflamed. I’ve never had pink eye like that. 

MRI shows empty sella. Spinal tap was done wrong. (Tapped twice and log rolled before pressure was taken and blood was in all vials so nothing could be used) 

Any ideas on what could be going on? My retina is willing to refer me to another neuro eye specialist for a second opinion (she emailed me and offered this after low vison; since I didn’t request it it makes me feel like she really doesn’t know what’s going on either) 

Please ask any questions and I’ll try to answer them. I have had 3 aunts lose vision before adult and one lose it in adulthood. But unsure of what caused this. Glaucoma also runs in my family. I do not have diabetes. It’s been tested 10 times and even done with a 2 hour fast; orange drink and test again.

bvj8nv,I am 29 and have -10.00 in both eyes and they keep on increasing. Will it never get stable or am I likely to go blind in the future? For how high a power will I get glasses and contacts?,"Hi there, 

I am a 29 year old Bangladeshi male. I have had myopia since grade 2 and now I have -10.00 in both eyes, with about -1.00 astigmatism in one. 

I wear really heavy glasses and I have floaters that annoy a bit. I visit the ophtalmologist but he says there is nothing to stop the progression. 

I thought by the time you are 20 years or so, your power should stabilize and not change for the past two years. It is only after then you can do a LASIK. However the ophtalmologist is suggesting a LASIK despite that my power has increased last year, this year and in previous years. He had me do the corneal pressure and the measurement of corneal thickness, you know those tests you do before LASIK but I opted out of a LASIK. 

My question is: 

* Is this degenerative myopia? That is will my eyesight keep on getting worse until I lose my sight? 

* For how much power will I be able to get socially acceptable glasses for? My glasses are currently very large because even if they are the highest index and made small. They look bad but are not extremely ugly as in say those types of machines they give you in the hospital. In my country the highest power of contacts is -7.00. So I was wondering, for how high a power will I get socially acceptable glasses and contacts?

* Is LASIK safe given the myopia is worsening year by year still? 

* Is there no way to stop this increase in myopia?",3,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/bvj8nv/i_am_29_and_have_1000_in_both_eyes_and_they_keep/"")",2019-06-01 03:02:19,

bvrr5a,Severe Chronic Allergic Conjunctivitis--last ditch effort. Where to go next if it fails?,"I am a 20 year old female patient with posterior uveitis, chorioretinitis, hashimoto's thyroiditis, and severe chronic allergic conjunctivitis. I have posted about this is in the past but I am posting again after seeing my opthomologist (a uveitis specialist). 

Here is my history. I was diagnosed with posterior uveitis and chorioretinitis in February. Around this this time I slowly started having external eye discomfort as well, but it didn't start getting really bad until March. For the uveitis I was started on a very slow 50 mg prednisone taper. I will note that the allergic conjunctivitis started getting worse when my prednisone was tapered to 30mg for 6 weeks. I am currently on 20 mg for the uveitis and it is worse than ever. 

For the past 3ish months my eyes have been extremely and increasingly uncomfortable and painful. Very dry, tight, and burning. It is often worse throughout the day and is unbearable by the afternoon and evening. I have been crying in pain every night, and sometimes go to bed to make the pain go away. My opthomologist has tried, in order, ketorolac, pazeo, pazeo and ketorolac, and pataday. None have worked. I also started zyrtec, which has not helped at all. I have no other allergy symptoms like runny nose or itching and watery eyes. Which makes sense because I am on prednisone and zyrtec! I use preservitive free artificial tears 5+ times a day with no real relief. On the exam she was shocked how red and inflamed my eyelid undersides are, and could tell I was in so much pain.

So, my opthomologist agrees this is very odd. She says she can't prescribe me prednisone drops because, due to being on oral prednisone, my pressure is already 23 in both eyes. She says no opthomologist would prescribe pred drops with my pressure. So, as a last ditch effort she is prescribing me  Lotemax drops as a milder steroid and Lastacalf antihistamine drops. She says if this does not work she doesn't know what she could try next.

So, where do I go from here if this doesn't work? I  honestly am not optimistic given nothing else has worked. What type of doctor or eye subspecialty should I try? Should I try to go to a place like Hopkins, Wills, or even MERSI? I can't live like this forever. I'm happy with her treatment of my uveitis, we are most likely going to begin immunotherapy soon, but this external problem is outside her scope. She thinks my severe reaction is due to my autoimmune problems causing my body to overreact, but I guess can't provide another explanation.

I’m an almost 40 yo with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (a connective tissues disorder) and previously took plaquenil.

My last eye exam 2 years ago the PD was 55. I didn’t wear glasses before that. The most recent one last month (by an ophthalmologist) the PD was 62, which seems like a huge change. My eye is definitely not 7 mm farther from the other now. When I asked about that she acted as if I was challenging her and got offended. I’m just wondering if that’s expected. She said it must be EDS. I was blind when I left the office bc of the drops so I didn’t press it.

For the record, the glasses I’m wearing now don’t create strain or headaches, that actually happens if I don’t wear them. But I do need a new pair bc the prescription is stronger now.

The retina specialist mentioned the bleeding has stopped and she should be fine in 3-4 months and there is no other retinal problems like detachment. Since we do not know the cause of this the retina specialist wanted us to come in ( 2 days, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months) to make sure there is no damage happening to retina. She doesn't see flashes or experience pain. Note : She is near sighted and have been wearing glasses since 12-13. I have few questions regarding her condition.

1. What is the risk of getting this vitreous hemorrhage again?
2. What is her risk of developing retinal tear or retinal detachment?
3. How to make sure she doesn't get this again?
4. What kind of food/life style change should be made this doesn't happen again?

bwrnnx,allergic conjunctivitis ?,"To start off I need to mention I will try to get to an ophtalmologist/the hospital tomorrow but i need ideas on what it may be/what to ask/what tests to ask for.

Now, a brief history. Last year one of my eyes started tearing, a lot, and I got white stringy stuff in it. This happened close to summer, I am not sure but I think pretty much around this time. I went for a consult, i was told it was bacterial conjunctivitis (though the secretions were not tested). I followed treatment (antibiotic eye drops). The problem persisted, so the doctor kept changing antibiotics, for what i think were stronger ones and blamed me for it saying i touched my eyes with unwashed hands.

Went to another, same diagnosis, same treatment.

Third time, same thing, same results, except this one decided to sample my secretions. They came back clean, but due to the ammount of antibiotics I was given (like some sort of chicken i guess). I take the tests again about two weeks later, ofc, clean, NOT BACTERIAL CONJUNCTIVITIS. Took them about three months to realize this, three months where i kept getting fed antibiotics like candies.

Now, I went to a fourth one in the capital, pretty much crushed and wanting the eye removed more or less. She said she has no idea, but told me my glass prescriptions had changed. I buy new glasses, I am suddenly cured (wtf). I assumed it was some sort of eye strain except:

today, about a year since then, same symptoms hit me like a train while i was riding, ironically enough, a train. Seven hours of fun later I am scared to shit and wanting to die. I will get on the next train back to my home city and go to a hospital. However, given my history, please any ideas what it could be ? It's just the left eye, no nasal congestion, no nothing. Just white stringy mucus, lots of tearing (if I am hydrated) and the outer corners of my eye tearing. Also sticky tears.

If it matters i am young, under 30, and wear bifocal glasses, though i forget the prescription (I think it hovers near the 3 number, could very easily be wrong, lenses are pretty thick)

bwuqdu,"Weird Symptoms, 3 Eye Docs and a Neuro clear me in their exams."," I Expect no Official Medical advice, and hold no one that replies responsible for anything pertaining to my health.  I simply hope to hear from someone else's experience if any, 

Hey there,

I guess this is probably against the rules, and i'm sorry but i'm desperate to get this to as many possible professionals. So ban me if you must. But here goes.

I got a puzzle for you guys if any med people are sorting by new.I have so much reassurance im about over it, but i figure'd i'd reach out to the internet and see if anyone else could shed some light on my situation.

About 1,5 years ago i started noticing some light sensitivity, car lights/sun reflections were much brighter and harder to look at than normal. This is still a thing and for some reason seems to be more/less intense depending on the day.With this i get starburst effects around bright lights which weren't there before.At the same time, intermittently i would get more intense after images. (looking at something and it's ""ghost"" for lack of a better term remained in my vision for longer than normal. I know this happens to everyone but it become more intense""I have problems with text sometimes too, i will get the lines between the sentences as after images making it very hard to concentrate on reading.

\-Went and got an eye exam, everything looked great. (Probably around june 2018)

Sometimes i get little black specks that only appear in my vision when i blink. These aren't floaters (i will get to that in a moment) Most the time it's just a little black dot, sometimes 3 or 4. And sometimes it's a little line or blob. It'll float there becoming very apparent in my vision for the split second after i blink, then dissapear.

In certain lighting situations i can also see the capillaries inside my eyes for a split second if light hits me at the right angle, this also had never happened before whatever changed. Like a weird golden glow of veins. pretty cool/freaky.

I've now noticed i can see what i call ""black lightning"" when i look at something bright and blink really fast. (Obviously these are capillaries)

Around the same time, (Roughly January) I started noticing little sparks or sprites flying around in my vision. This is ""Blue field entoptic phenomena"" Where for whatever reason i can see the white blood cells inside my eye! I remember seeing it when i looked at the sky as a kid, and even looking it up then and thinking it was cool!Well now it's not cool anymore, i see it all the time. Against any bright colored surface, walls, sky, etc. And it never stops.

Floaters. I've always had them too... but in the past 6 months, more and more are popping up (big long stringy spiderweb ones). Or at least they're easier to see for some reason.

This caused me to go to an ophthalmologist . Who gave me an exam and told me it was probably migraines and I looked perfectly healthy.Out of anxiety i went to another one to get a second opinion, who also told me that I looked healthy, but saw a little tiny hole in the retina that he usually wouldnt worry about. But since i was so symptomatic he wanted me to see a retinal specialist. (Also i want to mention, that i made a comment about how clear i could see the capillaries during the eye exam, and how it basically transported me to another world, inside a big veiny sphere) He made a comment about how it usually isnt that intense for people.

So I did. I went and saw this guy, who also told me i was 100% ok and nothing to worry about. Almost agitated at the other doc for even sending me...

I've always had ""visual snow"" grainy vision especially in the dark, but it's gotten more intense recently too. Sometimes getting very intense. Never before has it changed in intensity like this, seems to get worse when i'm sick especially.

I went to a Neuro, he also mentioned migraines, and told me to get an MRI. Which i did, and low and behold it was normal. Except for i had a little bit of something going on in my sinuses....

The other night too... i don't know if i was half dreaming or what, but i was lying in bed and the visual snow got really bad, to the point where i could barely make out the defined edges of things. Granted it was dark, but it for some reason didn't scare me, as i think i've exhausted my bodies anxiety fuel.

I am 29, decent health, perfect vision otherwise...

Can anyone at all help me? I'm at a loss, and god damn this is driving me insane. I try my best not to focus on it, but there's just so much distraction in my vision now, between the bright lights, floaters, and snow... I can't help but not focus on it and it makes me very sad/scared.

Could it be a vitamin/mineral/electrolyte thing? My ""Adaptation"" doesn't seem to be working as well as it used to, filtering out competing images... is there a vitamin that fuels that? I'm just grasping as straws at this point... if the eye specialists and neurologists don't know what hope do I have? I can usually get used to stuff, but this is so much visual input all the time, I don't know if i can. Anyway, sorry for the long read, if anyone even reads it. Have a good day.

bwvw29,Tilted Vision,"So about two weeks ago, I suddenly noticed that straight lines look like they tilt to the right in my left eye. It's not just a portion of my vision in my left eye (I looked at the Amsler grid and all the boxes are even, everything looks good, but things are tipped evenly all over the visual field.) When I read, lines of words wobble when I shift my eyes back and forth. In fact, there is a strange trapezoidal effect when I look at my computer screen and have a browser window open. This also happens without my glasses. 

I have been to an ophthalmologist 4 months ago bc of other visual issues (In fact I've been to an ophthalmologist about three times in the past 12 months (once bc I had a retinal hemorrhage/bruise, and another time bc my blind spot in my right eye is wonky and grids warp around it) and I am reluctant to go again bc I don't want them to label me... plus I don't have health insurance and I have had to pay out of pocket for these tests). I had an OCT scan, a visual field test, and a dilated eye exam at my last visit. Everything came back clear and they said I had healthy retinas. She gave me a new prescription but I think it's wrong bc I can't read from my right eye with them on and it's blurry and my astigmatism shifted from 20 to 122  (I'm going to schedule an appointment soon). So, I have an astigmatism in my right eye, but have not been diagnosed with an astigmatism in my left.

I am a 30 year old woman. I am extremely anxious but I think the eye doctor is dismissing my symptoms bc I am stressed and have a very stressful job and a lot of anxiety. I honestly hope this is just anxiety but it's not letting up. I've been dizzy, it's difficult to read on my computer screen now bc I can see the tilted browser window (also bc of the wobbling I mentioned above).

Hi. We live in Bangladesh. The problem with my father's eyes is that he says he feels like he cannot move his eyes fully upward as he used to be able to. He can move his eyes fully upward I have seen it, its just that he feels a bit of stuckness/obstacle in the upper regions especially on the top left corner of the left eye when he tries to move his eyes upward. He has had this problem ever since a health episode 1.5 months ago. 

Can someone tell me the name of this condition and what might have caused it?

----------------------
Context: 

My father had a medical issue about 1.5 months ago. He already had hypertension and had angiogram 1.5 years ago but it was found that only small blood vessels in the heart are narrowed which cannot be stented and only medications were given. He did not take any of the medications and 1.5 months ago, he started sweating, vomitting and could not lift his head and had severe vertigo. He was admitted to the emergency but his ECG, pressure and all that were found to be normal. He had a bunch of hearing tests, MRI and discharged 4 days later. An unconfirmed diagnosis of vestibular neuritis was given. 

A carotid doppler showed 42% blockage in the carotid artery. The MRI showed signs of tri-ventricular hydrocephalus, brain atrophy, demyelination, parasinusitus and lacunar infarcts. We then went to the ENT, Neurosurgeon, Cardiology.

bx6erm,Cyclophotocoagulation,"I am having a predicament and I'd like some advice or support as to what to do.

So some background,  I was born blind in my left eye with a lazy eye. The right eye is pretty normal with decent vision. 
As of 2010-2011 I developed a cataract in that eye.
I did not have an eye doctor at that time and it progressed into a dense hyper mature cataract over the next 7 or 8 years. 
In 2018 I have been going to the Wilmer eye institute in MD and I am additionally diagnosed with glaucoma in this left eye.  IOP was 54. With eyedrops it has gone down to 46. The right eye has an IOP of 16.

I have consulted with an opthomologist,  two retina specialists, and a glaucoma specialist.  All 4 believe removing the cataract is too risky.  It is a short eye, a dense cataract,  a flat cornea. These factors and other unknown factors have them feeling it is better to not remove the cataract,  as it can pose greater complications.  
The glaucoma specialist wants to perform the laser surgery cyclophotocoagulation to reduce IOP. 
I asked if it is unsuccessful will they remove the cataract.  He said no,  he would repeat the laser. 
I am of two minds about this. 
If I get the laser,  there is a risk of damaging my eye. 
There is the high possibility of the pressure spiking back up due to the cataract remaining. 
I don't want to put my already vulnerable eye through more laser.
There is chance it will be successful,  and any complications after,  I am in good hands with the doctor. 

Or,  I could not get the laser and manage the pressure with drops. 
The eye will remain as is, without the potential risk of the laser doing damage. 
If the pressure will more than likely rise again,  why put my eye through that extra trauma.
Also,  I have never had sight in that eye.  Really,  I just get eye pain and headaches. But its tolerable,  however,  mildly uncomfortable. 
Will the eye drops significantly reduce pressure over long term?

So I see both sides of this.  Both pros and cons.  The doctor says it's ultimately up to me.",1,19,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/bx6erm/cyclophotocoagulation/"")",2019-06-05 12:00:34,

bxhm17,Does CSR cause heightened pressure in the affected eye?,"I have a grayish spot in my right eye vision that seems like a camera bulb flash when I blink. This started last Friday, and I went into the opthamologist, but he didn't see anything wrong with my eyes. The only thing of note was that while my left eye was a 20mmHg, my right eye was slightly elevated at 23mmHg. He wrote it off as a weird prolonged visual migraine but asked me to make another appointment if it lasted for much longer.

When I left the office they took my blood pressure and found it to be something like 145/103, elevated from what it normally is.

Today it's still here, and I've just found that other people experience similar visual anomalies with CSR. I fit the profile for CSR: drink lots of black tea, am usually stressed out, a workaholic, etc. And if my blood pressure was reading 145/103 at the doctor, that's like 4 hours after the onset of my symptoms, so I wonder if I had had a blood pressure spike that triggered it?

What I'm wondering is if CSR would explain the slightly elevated pressure in my right eye? Also, I have had a very very dull slight headache in the right side of my head and around my eye. I'm wondering if that is a symptom of CSR, as well? It's hard for me to tell because I think my headache may be caused by me trying to adapt to the strange new vision in my eye, rather than the eye thing being caused by a prolonged headache (I did not, for instance, feel a splitting headache or something and then it appeared in my eye. It's the other way around.) My headache does go away when I take aspirin.

Thanks for any help ... my retinal ophthalmologist appointment is on the 24th. Hoping to get some ideas before then though.",3,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/bxhm17/does_csr_cause_heightened_pressure_in_the/"")",2019-06-06 07:52:08,
bxoa2n,Floaters,"I’ve had floaters all my life. Very minor. Would often disappear and I would hardly notice them.

In the past year or two, they’ve gotten much worse. There’s a long “string” that’s always floating around my direct line of sight in the left eye, which looks like it’s made up of dozens of tiny bubbles, and which are so clustered it’s turned dark and makes it difficult to read.

In the past couple of months, a large round “blob” floater, similarly looking like it’s made of tiny bubbles, has appeared in my right eye. It isn’t as pronounced or as easy to see as the one in my left, but it’s bigger.

The particular problem with both is that they reflect light, especially sunlight and fluorescent light, so it looks like a blurry glare is floating across my vision any time I’m exposed to said light. It’s unpleasant and causes headaches, some of which are excruciating. I nearly had to leave work early today because of a light-exacerbated headache. I’m getting very painful photosensitivity, pain in my eyes, and occasional burning and stinging in my eyes as well.

I went to an optometrist for my first exam in about a decade last month. She did all standard tests and said she could see the floaters in a slit lamp, but that there is no sign of any disease and my eyes are otherwise healthy. But with the extreme severity of the symptoms, I can’t help but wonder if she’s missing something and that there’s something wrong.  Has anyone encountered this sort of thing before?

bxqwg6,What do you make of this? (please read),"I have been visiting eye doctors every month or so, 3 different ones (optometrist/retinal specialist/glaucoma specialist). I will explain from the start in a shortest way possible. 4 months ago I went for a check-up of my eyes due to stupidly looking at the sun, both eyes had centre vision damage, and my pressures read as 25 on a hand-held puff machine. A week later I went to a glaucoma specialist, measured twice on goldmann for 16 in both eyes with cornea thickness of 610 for both aswell. I passed all test. My left eye has a thinner than normal RNFL in one area although she was confident it was how I was born yet needed a timeline so asked me to return in 6-12months.   


This is when it gets odd, I'm not sure if this was already there months ago or is new. In both eyes, in pretty much the exact same spots along the retinal vessels there is a very, very small blind spot, about half the size of a mouse-cursor, I can easily see how it could've been missed on VF test. So I visited my optometrist who said my eyes both have very good structure, my nerves are good and everything is as it should be. Yes my left eye has that slight part of thinning, although my right eye does not, and the spots are basically symmetrical, he thinks this is unnoticed aftermath from my solar damage (As I was looking at the sun from this angle as well as central). Again my pressures read 16-17 in each eye and he thinks glaucoma is not at all in relationship because the only reason it is brought up is due to a false high IOP reading I had one time on a inaccurate puff-machine. No family history of any eye diseases, nothing. I've also been told diabetes, cotton wool spots (I have a history of being told my BP is sometimes too high), retinal artery bleeds/blocks? (the spots are exactly laying above the retinal artery veins). Yet all this keeps being dismissed because it's very symmetrical and the only symmetrical history I've ever done is from light damage.

bxyp8q,Distortion - related to BVD?,"Hello! I’m at a bit of a loss as to how to address the current changes in my vision. I’ve been seeing optometrists since I was a child, and in the last 18 months my vision has changed dramatically but I don’t seem to have corresponding changes on examination. I’m a 26 y/o female, moderate screen use, dodgy history with sunglasses because I hate the . I have a connective tissue disorder, but to my knowledge it has no impact on my eyes. 

History: Dx with binocular vision dysfunction, partial accommodation with prism glasses. Mild changes to near and distance vision, correction via glasses. Astigmatism in (I think) left eye. Nothing super exciting. Retinas look healthy, no dry eyes, nothing on examination that would lead to concern. Frequent headaches due to eye strain since childhood. 

In the last year or so I’ve been in two car accidents (my fault) due to my vision and I’m having major changes that are affecting my well being. I’ve tried to explain the circumstances to the ODs but I’ve been met primarily with “huh, keep doing your pencil pushups and get back to me.” Obviously I’m not looking for a diagnosis here, but my quality of life is diminishing and I don’t know who to talk to if there’s a chance it’s more serious. 

The best way I can describe my vision is that it’s just *wrong*. Nothing is where I expect it to be so I’m chronically running into tables, corners, other people, countertops, etc. I’m never without some sort of wound on my head because as soon as I start to bend down towards something or move in my kitchen I lose all sight of my surroundings until I’ve collided with something. Once an object is in motion I’m completely unable to track it, and on the other hand once I’m in motion I can’t track stationary objects. I have issues with glare, to the point where if I’m in my living room and the lamp next to me is on I’m unable to see the television. When reading text the few words I’m focusing on are relatively clear and still but all surrounding text will pulsate and flicker on and off. I have pretty severe dizziness as a result of the BVD, I’ve been asked by friends before if I was drunk because of swaying when I walk. 

I can’t describe it as tunnel vision, nor can I say my central vision is weak. To hold something in focus I have to focus intently on it, and frequently need to wiggle my head before I can create the image. I would blow this all off as just being annoying, but it’s sharply deteriorating and I’m worried how bad it can get. I don’t understand why BVD would get progressively worse. I do my pencil pushups, I track the stupid ball on a string, I do everything they ask but every month it gets so much worse. It’s to the point where I’m concerned I’ll be a risk during a code situation in a hospital when I can’t orient myself around the equipment. (Respiratory therapist)

The one test they still plan on doing when I return in a week to get my glasses is the darkness adaptation test. I’m assuming it’s to rule out macular degeneration, but I’m not sure. I certainly don’t expect a diagnosis of AMD. So where should I go from here? Do I seek out an actual ophthalmologist? It feels rude as hell to make a list and say “we need to discuss these because I feel shoved out of my appointments before I can address them.” And if the normal eye exams are normal, what else is there to do?

Before  the injection on Monday, retinal  fluid was visible (Amsler grid) in the  upper left corner of my eye.  Which brings me to my question:

Can   retinal fluid move to another direction in the eye (from upper left to   the center) due to a Lucentis injection or is it more likely new retinal   fluid? Noticed the fluid in the center of my vision on June 5, so 2   days after the injection. So the fluid was in the upper left corner and   now it looks like this on the Amsler grid:

Local   eye doctor (without OCT) wasn’t concerned, just saw some fluid on June  6  but no blood and says that retinal fluid can move after an injection   but I’m skeptical. I’m just afraid that Lucentis doesn’t work properly   anymore.

When  would OCT make sense in  this case since the injection was just 5 days  ago? I really don't want  to wait 4 weeks before it gets out of control  with new blood vessel  growth and leakages. I hope that Lucentis still  takes its effect.

bxzwvf,Doctors Disagree on Posterior Uveitis,"Patient here. I'm at a loss. Today I went to the retina specialist because my uveitis specialist needed the FA done to see if there was still active inflammation since I've been on high dose oral prednisone for a while and she needs to know if I should start immunotherapy (my uveitis specialist cannot do FA at her office because she doesn't have the machine). But today the retina specialist said he saw no signs of uveitis or retinal vasculitis and said that's why he told me to just wait and come back in 5 months originally (I saw him 5 months ago when I first started having symptoms). He said when he saw me 5 months ago the uveitis was so tiny it didn't need treatment and only offered me prednisone drops *if I wanted*.

 However, I was just at my uveitis specialist last week and she commented how damaged my vessels are, how they look very twisty and kinky. She says she can even see that with just a slit lamp examination. I'm honestly not sure what to think. My uveitis specialist said that if I had followed the retina guy's initial instructions to just wait and see that I most likely would have had a stroke in my eye and lost vision. And when I saw the retina specialist 5 months ago I had really bad strobe light effect in my eye that didn't go away till my uveitis specialist started me on 50 mg prednisone.

byn5ph,Please explain CYL discrepancy between Spectacle and Contact Lens prescription.," 

Hello everyone.

I am a 27 year old man with astigmatism. I have been wearing glasses since age 18, with vision problems undiagnosed and untreated before that. At my latest eye check up, I opted to give contacts a try, as I am very active and the need for them has finally outweighed my apprehension toward them.

At this latest visit, my optometrist set me up with a prescription for glasses and contacts. While I wait for my new glasses and contacts to arrive, I am wearing the contacts I was sent home with which she informed me are good for one month of wear.

She explained that for my contacts, she would prescribe me a different CYL measurement than the one for my glasses, **but I didn't really understand the reasoning behind this,** though she attempted to explain it to me. My CYL measurement for glasses is -1.75 in each eye, whereas she started me at -1.25 for my contacts, then moved me up to -1.50 after trying the first ones on and experiencing blurriness. This improved the blurriness, but in the 24 hours I've had to evaluate them, the level of blurriness at certain distances is still not acceptable to me.

So, tl:dr: **What is the purpose of there being a different CYL measurement between contacts and spectacles on the same person?** Do I just need to let my eyes adjust, or do I need my prescription touched up?",1,1,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/byn5ph/please_explain_cyl_discrepancy_between_spectacle/"")",2019-06-09 11:12:14,

I am still worried about it getting worse in the future though.

The cataract specialist I met with did not spend much time with me and only briefly ran through my options. From what I gleaned:

-Option 1: a lens that annihilates my near vision. After spending thousands of dollars to correct my just vision last year, obviously I am reluctant to choose an option that would require me to go back to needing refraction. I was also hoping to at least get to the ago of 40 before having to use reading glasses. -Option 2: (not an option) a lens that would make my distance vision poor and could cause depth perception issues because my other eye has good distance vision. -Option 3: the ""accommodating"" lens, which apparently I'm likely not be a candidate for due to corneal scarring after getting PRK.

Are these really my only options? Does anyone know of more recent lens developments or alternatives I should be asking about (or pursuing with a different doctor)?",0,10,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/bzy4qv/seeking_advice_cataract_lenses/"")",2019-06-12 16:05:14,
bzydf2,Visual Vibrations," 

Hello everyone,

I have been suffering a condition for the past few years involving vibrations in my vision which make it very difficult to read, especially with high contrast text. Not only does text move around, but so do most objects in my visual field, especially with high peripheral noise. I saw an ophthalmologist last year that performed some quick tests and confirmed no physical issues with eyes/retina. Over the past year I have been doing eye exercises as part of a vision therapy program under an optometrist. While my divergence/convergence scores have increased, this symptom still remains despite the progress in other areas, which is extremely debilitating as a student. While I will be seeing an ophthalmologist once again, I wanted to hear your thoughts about this as I realize the benefits of considering multiple perspectives.

I would also like to point out that the vibrations worsen when I'm in an environment with fluorescent lighting. Natural lighting is much better. I have sensitivity to light and issues with sensory overload, not only with sight but also with sound. To cope with this I have been recently wearing dark sunglasses outdoors as well as indoors which offer relief for the sensory overload, but also for the vibrations to a certain extent. I understand this doesn't address the root of the problem which I believe can be discovered after my doctor said the condition is likely not permanent.

I've read online about oscillopsia and the descriptions of this condition align quite well with what I'm experiencing. I understand there are different causes for oscillopsia, one of which is nystagmus which I don't believe is the case. Also I do not have dyslexia.

There are a few things apart from the sunglasses that seem to help with the vibrations, which I have been observing and recording over the past one year:

1. Extended fixation (usually after studying for a long time or watching a movie on my phone)
2. Reading black text on white paper is extremely difficult but looking at the page from an angle helps
3. When I wave my hand near my eyes, while maintaining long-distance gaze, the vibrations are reduced.
4. Heavy physical exercise seems to help slightly with vibrations.

And finally, lack of sleep worsens the symptoms significantly.

Thank you so much. I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",3,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/bzydf2/visual_vibrations/"")",2019-06-12 16:27:22,
bzzldb,Flashes in my eye but my retina hasn't teared?,After getting poked in the eye while playing basketball I started to experience flashes in my pereipheral vision repeatedly.

c09oml,Pigment Dispersion Syndrome and Reynaud's Phenomenon,"So, I'm glad this subreddit got made cause I have a questions and I didn't want to bother y'all in your professional subreddits.

&amp;#x200B;

7ish years ago my optometrist back home got that ""take a picture of the back of you eye"" machine. When he took mine he said I had ""suspicious discs, my disc ratio was off and I had bright retinas"". So he sent me to the ophthalmologist who said my pressures were fine. Everything was cool. Keep up with field of vision testing just in case.

&amp;#x200B;

Cut to this year when I went to a new optometrist. Pictures are taken, and he's all like ""anyone ever tell you"" and I'm like ""bright retinas, disc ratio off right? but pressures are fine so I prolly don't have glaucoma? Are you gonna make me go back to an ophthalmologist? "" and then he laughed and referred me to an ophthalmologist again.

&amp;#x200B;

This one found a very clear Zentmayer Ring and diagnosed me with pigment diversion syndrome. Which looking into doesn't seem that bad, I mean not great but like not awful and kinda interesting. But my pressures have never been up and it seems to me (completely medically uneducated pleb) that my optic nerves shouldn't look weird due to pigment diversion if my pressures aren't up?

&amp;#x200B;

But she also asked about my extremities in the cold and I was like ""That's a real thing? Yeah fingers and toes go white I lose range of motion from the elbow down"". I legit just thought I was crazy and I feel super vindicated and like it's not my fault I break phones in the winter XD. And she said something about Raynaud's Phenomenon. Which just sailed over my head at the time cause.... well this is all a lot of info for someone who knows nothing. 

 

So with all that info it seems to me that she thinks it's something like this  [https://bjo.bmj.com/content/82/8/855](https://bjo.bmj.com/content/82/8/855) which is frankly kinda cool. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now I'm all curious but not too worried cause the ophthalmologist seems super on top of things (visual field testing every 4 months, eye pictures every 6, and I have to keep a diary if my vision goes blurry due to exercise).

So I rinsed it out for a long time and went to the optometrist the day after for an emergency visit (the ophthalmologists were booked). He told me my corneas were perfectly clear and fine, pH was normal, vision was 20/20, etc. A couple weeks later I decided to book a visit to my regular ophthalmologist since I noticed that I sort of had discomfort and double vision in that eye when closing my right eye. I also noticed that when I looked at my phone close up with my right eye, it was fine, but the left eye the vision was just worse/sort of blurry.

Anyway, he told me that there were a couple irregularities on my cornea and some blood vessels that shouldnt be there. He said the blood vessels were likely from me wearing contacts the night before while my eyes were dry. He told me the other irregularity/irregularities were from dry eye and that both my eyes have droopy lids because I probably have sleep apnea which contributes to this. He was quite adamant the irregularities were not from bleach. He told me it'd be a lot worse and would look different to him and that he's seen bleach damage before.

Anyway, he told me to use a gel at night before sleep and wet my eyes 4-5 times a day and that the damage was impermanent. I do think the double vision thing is probably kind of normal because I notice it to a degree in my right eye. However, whats going on with the vision in my left eye being fine (when I look at my phone) in the morning but not later on in the day? I dont think it gets progressively worse, but it does get worse shortly after I wake up and stays that way.

Is it the drops causing this? I just dont get why its fine in the morning. I do sometimes feel like my eye always sort of stings (left, not right). I notice it seems to be getting slightly better, however. I was told that maybe my eye is having an adverse reaction to the preservatives and use a preservative free one.

About 6 weeks ago I noticed a weird after-image / gray-ish mark in my left eye. I have now established that this is a very small blind spot. The spot is very small, about the size of a comma and in my upper left central vision. It seems to be vertical, like the shape of an I. The mark does not and has not moved at all. 

I first noticed the day after that my mouse cursor can partially disappear in my vision. I can also make very small things disappear in my vision. I can make a red laser pointer, pointed at a wall 10 feet away, completely disappear. 

After 6 weeks of tinkering with the spot in my vision I have a few main descriptions of it: It is most visible when looking at things with high contrast, like black text on a white background. It is best described as a tiny water droplet on my glasses. It seems to take on the color of things around it’s perimeter. It is definitely taller than it is wide. 

I have been to an optometrist and ophthalmologist. Neither doctors found anything wrong with my eyes. The ophthalmologist did the basic retinal scan and ordered an blood flow test. They injected me with ink/indicator, and took quite a few pictures with a very bright light. They did not find any leakage or damaged vessels. His advice was to come back two weeks later. I did so, and no difference. He said hopefully it would go away and to call if anything changes.

* Sex - M
* Height - 6'2""
* Weight - 185
* Race - White
* Duration of complaint - lifelong but worsening on and off since 2014, latest bout of worsening started in March, has become debilitating enough that he had to quit his job, has never improved, only gotten worse
* Location (Geographic and on body) - New Hampshire, eyes
* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any) - ocular migraines, under-active thyroid, anxiety and depression (mostly related to his eyes)
* Current medications (if any) - Buspar - 15mg, Levothyroxine, Lexapro - 5mg, Amytriptaline - 25mg

Symptoms and other pertinent information:

* Darkening vision- feels like eyes are constantly adjusting from coming in from outside on a bright day, regardless of whether he is inside or outside or if it is actually bright out. This does not come and go. It is constant.
* Seems as if things are moving over his field of vision, like a flickering effect, a waterfall of floaters has happened on occasion
* Very red eyes by the end of the day, though he usually says they don't hurt
* Ocular migraine – bright rainbow light in the middle of vision, both eyes
* Dizziness and balance issues that come and go
* Headaches and stiff neck, sore throat that comes and goes
* MRI showed possible infection in forehead/sinuses, currently on an antibiotic for that but nothing has changed

The internet has been extremely unhelpful in giving us ideas about what could cause darkening vision when the eyes have been checked multiple times and everything always comes up structurally healthy. He has a family member that went blind due to MS, so he has been tested for this, but so far all tests have come back negative. 2 MRIs, a CAT scan, X-ray, and all they have found is that he has mild scoliosis and a possible sinus infection. He's so stressed about this that he can't sleep and spends most of the day laying around depressed because he's going blind and no one can tell him why. It's devastating to watch and feels so unfair.

c20t5o,painful eye drops for Corneal Ulcer,"my dad is doctor, On 7th june, he was treating his patients when he had irritation in his right eye. Next day his eye turned red and left eye also showed redness. He went to see eye specialist and he gave eye drops. He used them and his left eye recovered but the right one (which got infected before) stayed same. By this time, his eye cornea was red, his eye lids swollen and lens had yellowish matter. He couldn't see, only sense light. We went to see another Eye specialist. He gave antibacterial and antiviral eye drops but it didn't change anything. We went to see another doctor this friday, he said it's Corneal Ulcer and told us to use eye drops (listed below). He used them on friday and saturday and little bit on Sunday. On Monday we saw doctor again, he said there's little improvement and he added another drop Amphotecin ,which he said is anti-fungal, to the list. The 4 drops we were using since friday, burned dad's eyes. They're painful, I need to ask is it normal?? Also As soon as I put the drops in, his eye lids get swollen. Yesterday after the doctor visit when I put 1 drop of Amphotecin in his eye, he screamed in pain. Is the pain normal? or drops badly made, with improper base solution? also Moxifloxacin HCL burns his eye while plain Moxifloxacin doesn't. We asked doctor if he can use plain one, he said HCL one is from a better brand so he should keep using this one.

c21e62,[Q] Eye drops for bacterial conjunctivitis," Hello, guys. A patient with (currently) mild bacterial conjunctivitis here.

I was prescribed Vigamox (moxifloxacin) eye drops for my condition, but I developed severe side effects from it and stopped usage the first day. At this point my eyes look much better and I'm thinking to switch to Tobradex or let the conjunctivitis go away on its own, but my doc is only available on Wednesdays and Fridays, and have not met with him again yet to talk about this. However, I'm a bit scared of aminoglycosides. I know they are ototoxic and neurotoxic. Are they completely safe to use as eye drops from this point of view (ototoxicity, neurotoxicity)?

Also, I heard about azithromycin, but don't know much about it. Any opinions on that for my condition?",1,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/c21e62/q_eye_drops_for_bacterial_conjunctivitis/"")",2019-06-18 05:02:19,
c22i7x,MGD and Retinoids," I  a 31 y/o female patient who has been suffering with dry eyes for the  last 7ish years. I am currently under the care of an optometrist and  when I am able to tolerate contact lenses I use Dailies Total 1. I  regularly use eyelids wipes, take quality fish oil supplements, use an  eye mask for warm compresses and express my glands at home nightly (or  sometimes every other night if I'm feeling lazy and my eyes are doing  okay). My optometrist has also prescribed an antibiotic and antibiotic  ointments in the past for me to take. I do all of this and my eyes are  still exceptionally dry and I typically can't wear contacts for more  than a few hours.

I just realized that my  dry eyes somewhat coincide with my use of retinoids for my acne. I also  took accutane when I was in high school (about 17ish years ago). While I  don't put the retinoids any where near my eyelids, is it possible that  this is contributing to my dry eyes? I’ve decided to switch to a non  retinoid medication, at least for the time being to see if it helps. If  not, my next step will be Lipiflow. Any insight or tips would be  appreciated.

He said he was expecting it to get worse because of all of the leakage points in the eye, and he couldn’t explain the phenomenon.

Maybe optic neuritis at the being of all the vision problems?

c485ge,Ocular Herpes Diagnosis - should I get a second opinion?,"Please help, I am really freaked out. 39 YO white female; 5'5""/136 lbs; FL, USA; oral contraceptives &amp; effexor; unremarkable medical history, except moderate dry eye and 2 past instances of giant papillary conjuctivitus in the last few years.

Dry eye syndrome made it too uncomfortable to continue with contacts, so I have been wearing glasses only for about 2 years now. Have not had a GPC diagnosis since I switched to glasses. I don't use any prescriptions for the dry eye, just fish oil and preservative free drops.

About 4 days ago, I noticed a foreign body sensation in my left eye. It felt just like when I get an eyelash in my eye. But no eyelash. Over the next few days, it comes and goes, but doesn't go away despite using lots of preservative free drops. If I had to pinpoint the spot, I would say under my upper eyelid. Today, Saturday, I'm expecting it will be better since I am not having to sit in front of my computer at work all day - but it actually feels slightly worse. The sensation is not painful, just annoying. There is no redness, watering, discharge, no crusting, no sensitivity to light - nothing like that. In fact, my left eye does not look any different from my right.

I am going out of town in a few days, so decide I should see someone. Since it's Saturday, my options are limited and I go to the vision center of a chain superstore and see an optometrist. He puts the dye in my eye, has me put my forehead and chin in the thing, and shines the light in my eye. He says there is a small ""area of pooling"" on my cornea. Initially, he says it does not look like herpes, as it does not appear ""dendritic."" However, he says if this was just dry-eye related irritation, it should have healed by now since I am relatively young and healthy (but I have been under heavy mental stress lately); he continues looking at my eye with the light, and eventually says that under magnification, the spot does appear dendritic and he is ""95% sure"" it is herpes. I was shocked, as I always thought ocular herpes presented in a much more dramatic fashion. He put me on antibiotic drops and valcyclovir.

I did not tell the optometrist this, but I was diagnosed with genital herpes about 15 years ago; I had specific testing that confirmed it was in fact HSV-II, not HSV-I. I have been asymptomatic since the first few years after diagnosis. Not on any suppressive meds. I've never had a cold sore on my mouth in my life. I've always known about the risk of cross-contamination to my eyes, and have taken care to avoid this. Though I can imagine scenarios where it could have happened, e.g., maybe I scratched an itch in my genital area while sleeping, then touched my eye? I am really freaked out that, on top of the dry eye, now I have this.

What are the chances this is really occular herpes and not just a random scratch or something dry-eye or GPC related? Any help much appreciated. Thank you.",1,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/c485ge/ocular_herpes_diagnosis_should_i_get_a_second/"")",2019-06-23 10:28:34,
c486x1,"Eye Injury Question / ""Stuck"" iris/pupil","Hi,

21 days ago I was hit in my right eye with a baseball going about 80 miles an hour.  I had glasses on that absorbed some of the impact.   I had no vision at first and went to the ER.  My eye was full of blood and took 2 days to drain.   My pressure was in the 70s and I had significant inflammation.   I've had uveitis in the past and the inflammation was pretty similar.  I was put on steroid drops for that and on acetazolamide, brimonidine, dorzolamide and lumigan for the pressure.

The main concern those first two weeks was managing the pressure and inflammation.  Dozens of floaters showed up after 5 days and remain today.  I basically have a cloud of black spots in  my vision.

The other issue, and my primary concern, is that the muscle controlling the pupil size appears to be damaged.  My pupil/iris does not react to light, or lack of light.   It has been the exact same size since the injury.   My ophthalmologist says it appears the left side is trying to constrict when he shines a light on it but the right side (where the impact was) does nothing.  

He's told me all I can do is wait and I was just wondering if anyone has any experience with this type of injury and if they could give me a possible recovery path (and is there anything else I could be doing).

Also, my pressure and inflammation normalized last week.  I'm still on the drops and go back this week to see if I can start tapering off.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated.  

Thanks for your time,

Pete

It's been about 2 months and the floaters haven't subsided at all and they are constantly in my vision 24/7.  My quality of life has plummeted down to zero and I'm extremely depressed everyday because of this condition.

I told the doctor I can't deal with all of these floaters wrecking my vision.  The ophthalmologist said trying to do a regular vitroectomy, in which the vitreous is drained, would cause cataracts.  So first they suggested a YAG Laser Vitreolysis.  I talked the only YAG Laser Vitreolysis specialist in my area, and they confirmed the PVD in both eyes but said the floaters were ""too big"" to do that procedure.  They said if I were to have a vitroectomy it would cause cataracts and damage my vision.

c50o8v,Light/screen/text glare in one eye - no idea - very bothersome.,"(Long post but I try to be thorough. Thanks for reading.)

Hey all,

I've had a minor glasses prescription since like early high school. Something like -.50. Only really use the glasses for night driving, movie theaters, etc.

Six weeks ago I was in a really bad mood one evening (read: highest stress/anger I've had in a long time) and went for a walk to the beach to chill out. When I got to the beach I noticed that my vision didn't seem super clear, and specifically my left eye was the cause. It was as if I couldn't focus or see the beach clearly, even with my glasses. First time I ever noticed this. I shook it off and it seemingly went away.

Then I noticed it a few days later at Costco, like something was bothering my left eye and again things went out of focus/clarity. Then it seemingly went away again, but it began to occur more and more. 

I went to an optometrist and she gave me an exam and dilated my eyes, and found no issue. I then went to another optometrist two weeks later who was much more thorough, didn't dilate (expensive), and found nothing as well but told me it may be because of stress. This was a few weeks ago, and my symptoms haven't gone away at all even though I'm not really stressed out about it or in general. The second optometrist told me that she can refer me to an opthalmologist if it's still bothering me in a while, and for now I've taken matters into my own hand to do as much research as possible.

I got new glasses with a blue light filter to see if that helps, and it doesn't. Visual acuity improves due to the prescription, but the light/glare/etc. issue remains. I am on the computer for probably 10-12 hours per day.

The issue is constant. I think partly I just didn't notice it for a while and now that I notice, I can't not notice. But there is an actual issue here that I'd like to solve - I do not believe this is stress/anxiety-based.

Symptoms:

* **Left eye ONLY**
* When looking at any lights or screens (phone/computer), all the text is washed out / overexposed / glaring. There is slight discomfort, no pain.
* Hard to describe exact effect but ""glare"" seems to be the most accurate. It's like all lights are a little extra powerful/glowy in my left eye.
* Seeing infrequent afterimages. Again, left eye only.
* Color saturation is reduced in my left eye by about 20%. I believe this is not a loss of color, but an overall ""gain"" or veil of white/brightness/glare in my left eye.
* Sunglasses greatly reduce how noticeable the issue is during the day when I'm outside - the glare / washed out / overexposed effect persists, but it's just less bright.
* Prescription glasses help the general visual acuity in my left eye but do NOT resolve the glare/brightness issue.


I started to keep a log of my experiences to see if I could find any patterns, and noticed two things related to darkness improving it.

1. At night, if I'm in my bed on my phone in a dark room, looking at my phone, the issue is 90% solved. Almost nonexistant. I first noticed the improvement one evening when I was driving home from the gym around midnight and noticed that looking at my phone (when stopped) with my left eye wasn't an issue.
2. I learned about the pinhole test, and made a rudimentary test with a piece of card stock. This also solved 90% of the issue, no matter the time of day. 

This leads me to believe that there's some issue with filtering light in my left eye, too much light is getting in, or something related.

33 yr/o male. Yesterday I went to my ophthalmologist (retinal specialist), and he noticed a very small tear in my left retina. It was not there 3 months ago (or the other ophthalmologist did not notice it.) He said we have two options- he can fix it right then and there, or we can wait a week or two to see if it shows signs of healing on its own. I opted to wait a week. Since then it is all I can think about. Maybe this sub can help clear my head a little.

\-How easy are retinal tears to repair? -How safe is the procedure? -What are the odds of getting another one? -I am very slightly nearsighted in my left eye (eye with the tear.) If he thought it was emergent, or if there was a significant chance of detachment, would he have said: ""no we need to do this now""? -Will this help decrease the floaters and specks I see in that eye? -What causes this kind of thing to happen? I have not had any trauma, and not diabetic, etc?

c5qugc,[M19] Two unexplained blind spots in my left eye.,"A few years ago I noticed that I have two blind spots in my left eye. I am not sure if I have always had these. One seems to be on the usual location of your blindspot caused by the optic nerve, however it is a lot bigger than the one in my right eye. I also have a smaller blindspot close to the center of my vision. I have already visited the hospital and they concluded that there is nothing physically wrong with my eye after an eye exam.

I am still worried about it getting worse in the future though. At the hospital I didn't explain that one blind spot was on the natural location but enlarged and I feel like that might have been some crucial information. My last option is to go and see a neurologist since there is no physical problem as far as they could tell. I'm not sure what to do and what this is and I'm of scared of slowely going blind.

Anyone else?","About a year and a half ago i got iritis in both eyes (they didn't find any underlying issues), it started to go away but then came back big time, so I've been using cortisone eye drops every single day in different amounts since then.

About maybe eight or so months ago my intra ocular pressure started to increase, I got eye drops to lower it, it helped for a while. IOP started to increase more and I got more eye drops to lower the pressure, eventually I had 4 different types of eye drops for the IOP only, but it still didn't seem to decrease enough, at worst it was around 37mmHg in the right eye, the left eye just behind, at best the right eye was at 23, now it's around 30 again in both and i am also eating Diamox to lower the pressure since 1,5 weeks back.

Cherry on top I also have cataract in both eyes now, I can still see okey without glasses though but doctors say i will need surgery for that too. Also the anterior uveitis /iritis spread, so it's now also inside the eye, the diagnosis for the inflammation is i think iridocyclitis now.

I work in medicine, nothing with eyes though, so I love to research these things but for this I am worried.

Now to my actual questions:

In one week I am getting glaucoma surgery in the right eye, apparently the IOP has done a small amount of damage to the optic nerve already. I am scheduled for Ahmed glaucoma valve.

The thing is, I am only 32  years old, and these implants doesn't seem to be meant to last for a lifetime. I am super worried if this really is the right way to go, or if it will make more harm to my eyes than trying to keep controlling the uveitis and IOP and thus lose some vision from damage to the optic nerve? I will very likely have to do the left eye also.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this too big of a surgery to do for so ""little"" of a problem, or am I only imagining there is no problem cause my brain/eyes is compensating the visual loss (which i can't really tell i have)?

c8yzun,Need help/advice: Onset of eye floaters and blurred peripheral vision (especially in the mornings) after treatment with SERM medication,"Hello,

I'm a 24 year old male that was treated with Raloxifene (SERM class drug) around 4 months ago (60mg/day). Around 15 days into my treatment, I've started noticing eye flashes in the nights (with closed eyes) and a large amount of eye floaters appearing in both of my eyes.

I've discontinued Raloxifene 2 days after the symptoms appeared after reading up on the possibility it was drug induced.

Since them, my peripheral field of vision in the mornings is heavily blurred (if I stipulate that I have a 120 degree vision span, this affects approximately 35 degrees starting from both sides, leaving me with 50 degress of clear image - like tunnel vision), which improves 30 minutes after I wake up and go about my day, but does not dissipate completely. I've also developed possible nearsightedness (?) as I really have to focus to see things that are close in adequate clarity (but am able to after 'compensating"" with my eyes).

I've always had excellent eye sight prior to this incident.

My condition appears to be stable; no new floaters have developed and blurrynes of my vision is not getting worse. I've experienced no additional eye flashes.

I went to an optician who performed a retinal examination of one of my eyes (direct exam approach), but discovered no abnormalities.

I'm not sure if relevant but the flashes were really weird - like they weren't emanating from my eyes, but from my brain. Not sure if this makes any sense. Additionally, and again, not sure if relevant, but my E2 and T levels are consistently low and am discussing possible TRT with my endocrinologist.

My question is; What should I make of this? Does this indicate towards any pathology? Are there any additional tests I should do, or steps I need to take? Anything I should be particularly worried about or look out for?

Anyway, I essentially used the flashlight on my phone to make my eyes dilate and undilate. My phone was right up to my face, but wasn't directly facing my eye. I basically had it pressed perpendicular to my cheekbone, if that makes sense. I probably did this for 30-45 seconds. 

I've had afterimages from a light source before but the resulting one was huge and covered my entire vision field - it was extremely prominent on everything I looked at. It was sort of in the shape of an infinity sign, which I'm assuming is because of the angles. This was really scary. It slowly diminished over the course of the next 30 minutes or so, and I can't see it today.

However, I do feel quite light sensitive today. I've noticed that while I don't see afterimages with my eyes open, if I close my eyes after being in a bright room I can see outlines of a few of the light sources in the room (like windows) which I haven't had happen before. Have I done damage to my retina or eyes?

I'm hoping that I'm just being paranoid. Ironically, I went to my eye doctor just last week and he did a slit lamp exam because he was concerned after I casually mentioned having a bunch of floaters (everything was fine). That lamp was really bright - I'm assuming more so than my phone LED - but I'm a bit concerned as I don't remember having such an intense afterimage afterwards.

As such, I wouldn't mind someone else's opinion so I know if I should go back to an optician or not.",1,6,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/c92v5v/can_a_phone_led_flashlight_damage_your_eyes_had/"")",2019-07-04 06:55:06,
c9av22,Help! Left eye twitch/flutter,"Hello everyone! As the title suggests, I’ve been dealing with a very persistent left under eye twitch for about a month straight. I’m at my wits end about it, and it’s giving me the worst anxiety. That being said, I did make a doctors appointment, but of course, it wasn’t doing it at the time of the appointment for the doctor to see. It was just a general checkup appointment, not an ophthalmologist appointment. I told her that I had a video of it but she just waved it off and didn’t seem too concerned about it. 

Now I know what everyone is gonna say, too much stress, fatigue, too much caffeine. I’ve completely stopped drinking coffee/caffeine since this whole thing started. I’d like to think I’ve been more stressed at certain points in my life than I am right this second, and my body has always dealt with it in different ways. 

Fatigue? It’s possible. I’ve been working 3am to after 12 pm for almost the whole month of June, right when this started. ONLY THING about that, is that 3am-12pm used to be my ‘normal’ shift for over a year and I’ve never had this problem. 

I’ve been taking magnesium/calcium supplements for about 5 days, 3 times a day. Because I’ve also read that a calcium/magnesium deficiency will cause it. 

My eye isn’t forcefully clamping shut or that part of my face isn’t forcefully moving. It’s just a little fluttery nerve under my left eye.. literally feels like a baby humming bird is trapped under my skin! At times it’s a lot worse than others, meaning if I show my boyfriend he says ‘uhh yeah that’s definitely noticeable’. Sometimes it’ll stop for the majority of the day and start up again around the evening time. 

I guess I’m just looking for reassurance that it WILL go away and maybe others have experienced this same thing, and what you did to help it go away? I’m sorry if this post is jumbled or jumps around. I feel like I’m going crazy trying to figure this stupid thing out! Am I just a worry wart? A paranoid Polly? Please Help!

c9cbr2,Been under a lot of stress lately and have had a hard time focusing on text.,"This past week I have been under an enormous amount of stress and I noticed a couple days ago I had a very hard time focusing on text on my cellphone or computer screen.

I saw and optometrist last week and everything was fine.  I mentioned the occasional difficulty focusing and they said new contacts should solve the problem.

c9p5gd,Best solution for starbursts caused by large pupils?,"I'm 26 and I've been wearing contacts since I was 12. My current prescription is -4.00 in each eye. I have super mild astigmatism in both eyes, but my optometrist told me to not worry about it at all. Starting from about a year ago, I've noticed my night vision is much worse than it used to be-- every light has a huge starburst around it and everything seems very dim, like I'm wearing sunglasses at night. More recently, I've noticed problems with focusing on things. My eyes seem to rapidly shift in and out of focus constantly unless I'm concentrating all my energy on keeping them focused. 

I recently had my yearly eye exam, mentioned these concerns, and after a thorough exam my optometrist said my eyes were perfectly healthy. When testing my vision, doing the standard ""read the lowest line you can read"" test, I could read the lowest line but again I was having issues with focus so I could technically read it but my eyes wouldn't focus on it long enough for me to read all of it. The doctor put some drops in my eyes to temporarily disable the focusing mechanism in my eyes (unsure what they were, he said it was similar to dilation, and it did in fact make my pupils super dilated), but I was still having focusing issues.

He had me try out some different brands of contacts, and I went back to see him twice more, with no alleviation of my symptoms, but at this point the only thing that was really bothering me to the point where I won't just accept it is the starbursts I see at night. I love driving, especially at night, but it's become harder and harder for me to drive because I live in the city and there are lights everywhere. I no longer can see what oncoming cars look like; I just see huge starbursts. I feel like I'm sunblinded walking around at night. I asked my optometrist why and he said it's because my pupils are large, and he recommended a $400 pair of glasses that has a special coating on it to prevent starbursts (DriveSafe). I'm 26 years old, and a grad student. I can't afford a $400 pair of glasses when I just spent $600 for contacts and $200 on eye exams! I've had large pupils my whole life (people often commented on them when I was younger) so I'm wondering why this is just now becoming an issue. My night vision used to be perfect. My prescription hasn't changed in years. My doctor claims the medications I'm on wouldn't cause this (Modafinil and gabapentin) but I'm not sure I believe that because this problem started happening around the time I started taking the gabapentin.

tl;dr: My large pupils are causing nighttime starbursts and poor night vision. Is there any solution to this problem that won't cost me a fortune?",1,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/c9p5gd/best_solution_for_starbursts_caused_by_large/"")",2019-07-05 20:49:12,

ca0bee,Blurred Vision and Pain Behind Eye,"32, Female,  Race:  Indian,  Location: USA

I started having pain behind left eye about 10 days ago (started noticing around 27-28 June).  I would like to know how serious the problem might be and where I should seek treatment.

I am in between jobs  and I am without insurance at the moment.   I would like to know how urgently I need care.   I will have insurance in October. 

Symptoms in Left Eye --

* Pain behind left eye - feels like pressure on the eye (started June 27)
* Pain when looking sideways or up and down without turning head (started June 27)
* Pain on forehead, temple around left eye. Initially felt relief when massaged the temples (as some online articles suggested). Later massages felt more painful. (started June 29)
* Pain when focusing on an object or written material (noticed June 30)
* Light sensitivity (noticed June 29-30) Sunglasses help a little.
* Pain in forehead and behind eye when head was moved quickly to look around, especially in brightly lit rooms (eg. gym).
* Blurred and distorted vision with left eye alone - first noticed a few days ago. Makes hard to read text with left eye alone, seems to distort color, I see white patches/spots when I focus on any object - this is especially noticeable when I look at some printed material. A plain colored object just looks blurry.
* No redness or change in appearance

Possibly Relevant Information -

In the previous week (June 24 to 28) I rode motorbike for 2 hours everyday with no sunglasses, requiring me to squint in the bright sunlight.

Experienced similar pain behind both eyes as described in points 1, 2, 3 on June 5 - 8. Background - very little sleep during travel to Israel and jetlag. I did not notice any blurry vision (but I did not check).

In the past week, experienced allergy symptoms - itchy eyes, sneezing and runny nose - the symptoms went away with antihistamines.

Last summer suffered from dry eyes - use of OTC eye drops cured it

This started as a general random twitch about six months ago. At first it would just twitch randomly, and now it’s only under that specific scenario. 

Just some background: I have terrible anxiety/depression/panic attacks. I also have a one year old daughter, dealing with a lot of piling debt and didn’t sleep well for a long time because I worked at night and slept during the day. I also eat like trash, have high blood pressure for my age (24M)

Need help/advice: Onset of eye floaters and blurred peripheral vision (especially in the mornings) after treatment with SERM medication
Hello,

I'm a 24 year old male that was treated with Raloxifene (SERM class drug) around 4 months ago (60mg/day). Around 15 days into my treatment, I've started noticing eye flashes in the nights (with closed eyes) and a large amount of eye floaters appearing in both of my eyes.

I've discontinued Raloxifene 2 days after the symptoms appeared after reading up on the possibility it was drug induced.

Since them, my peripheral field of vision in the mornings is heavily blurred (if I stipulate that I have a 120 degree vision span, this affects approximately 35 degrees starting from both sides, leaving me with 50 degress of clear image - like tunnel vision), which improves 30 minutes after I wake up and go about my day, but does not dissipate completely. I've also developed possible nearsightedness (?) as I really have to focus to see things that are close in adequate clarity (but am able to after 'compensating"" with my eyes).

I've always had excellent eye sight prior to this incident.

My condition appears to be stable; no new floaters have developed and blurrynes of my vision is not getting worse. I've experienced no additional eye flashes.

I went to an optician who performed a retinal examination of one of my eyes (direct exam approach), but discovered no abnormalities.

I'm not sure if relevant but the flashes were really weird - like they weren't emanating from my eyes, but from my brain. Not sure if this makes any sense. Additionally, and again, not sure if relevant, but my E2 and T levels are consistently low and am discussing possible TRT with my endocrinologist.

My question is; What should I make of this? Does this indicate towards any pathology? Are there any additional tests I should do, or steps I need to take? Anything I should be particularly worried about or look out for?

I go to the specialist once a year and sometimes we end up discussing eye surgery. I'm 23 now, and when I was younger, we discussed the possibility of laser surgery to completely remove the need for contacts and/or glasses.

Today, though, I found out Lasek/Lasik can only ''remove' approximately 4.5 diopters, so I'd be left with a +4.5 on one eye, and +2 in the other. The alternative she mentioned was a surgery called lens implant, which would correct my vision up to a point where I wouldn't need glasses anymore, but wouldn't recommend this either. Her reasoning was because of my eyes dimensions, fitting the artificial lens could create some pressure which, in the long term, would lead to more problems.

Should I go to another specialist for a second opinion? I've only been to one in the past 10 or more years, and frankly I trust this doctor completely.  But in my line of work, many hours a day of reading are required and because of my poor vision, and doing the work gets increasingly difficult in my condition. A surgery would have been ideal. Are there any other alternatives? Have you heard of LASEK/LASIK or any other procedure correcting more than 4 diopters?",1,1,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/cbxi58/high_hyperopia_any_remedy/"")",2019-07-11 09:12:57,

I had uveitis as a teen and as a result, now have cataracts at 30.

I'm having trouble deciding if i should set my toric IOLs to near or distance. I just keep thinking about makeup and looking at my phone. I'm already nearsighted, so I thought choosing set to near would be best, but the actual in focus spot isn't very large.

cby6r9,Varying astimatism,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

 Since February, I have varying levels of astigmatism, especially far away.   (I'm 23)

  
At first it was only on the right eye, but a few weeks later, the left was also affected.  
This evolves over days, sometimes I have almost perfect vision in both eyes, sometime something like 10/20 on one eye and 16/20 on the other. It slightly worsens over time. 

  
I had an appointment with my ophthalmologist  last month, he checked all the basic stuff and the background of my  eye, without any visible disease / problem. He said I should come back next month, with anesthetic eye drops.

  
Astigmatism is usually diagnosed  way earlier and doesn't change that much.

cc0t7h,Central Vision Issues,"I’ve been having worsening central vision issues and all of my doctors have been stumped. I’m wondering if anybody here can give me any insight. I’ll post a rough timeline below. Sorry for the long format.

1. Diagnosed with Pigment Dispersion Syndrome June 2017, and was treated with Alphagan and Dorzolamide. I’ve also had permanent haloes from these drops since then.

2. August 2017, I got uveitis in the eye I was taking eyedrops in. It went away within a few days, then I was put on Betagan.

3. November 2017, my doctor switched me to Lumigan. Start noticing my night vision is getting worse, but my doctor tells me it’s probably not the Lumigan, as I was only taking it in one eye.

4. Get full work up from neuro-ophthalmologist January 2018, who notices I have some bilateral nuclearization of lenses and macular thickening, but my photoreceptor layer was normal and the thickening was close to the same in each side.

5. Around this time, I notice that I have dark central vision when I wake up, but I goes away within a few minutes. I also have prolonged after images.

6. April 2019 I’m put on Lumigan in my other eye due to high pressures from another uveitis flare up.

7. Over time, I notice that my night vision is worse, I can now see those central spots in in dim light, not just morning. Vision in general looks staticky, and I go back to Betagan in May of 2019. Stopping the Lumigan made my visual acuity somewhat more clear, but my night vision and static vision is about the same.

I’ve seen several ophthalmologists and glaucoma doctors and none of them have been able to give me an answer. I had my vitamins checked, which came back normal. I was only taking Lumigan in one eye when these issues started, so everybody has told me it can’t be that.",1,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/cc0t7h/central_vision_issues/"")",2019-07-11 13:25:23,

ccaycg,Sudden intolerance to Astigmatism correction? Insight requested.,"TL;DR at bottom.

Got back from eye doc after having terrible strain, headaches, and nausea with glasses I’ve been wearing for a year or so. Prior to this past month, I didn’t have any noticeable issues with these glasses/lenses other than some tired eyes at times (who doesn’t?). My right eye while wearing my glasses over the past month has had a pulling sensation, making me feel nauseous, and giving bad headaches. Visual quality has been fine, not blurry, but something has been off with that eye. I even went back to an older pair from two years ago to try but the right eye continued to be an issue and I have been told that both of my pairs of glasses had the same cylinder correction for the right eye.

After one attempt at making new lenses with different a power which didn’t work (right eye continued to be an issue), he and the master optician at the office believe my right eye is not tolerating the astigmatism cylinder correction of -1.25 I had in it any longer. He said he knocked the cylinder down significantly in that eye and even went from -2.00 to -1.75 diopters in that eye. I could not tell the difference between -1.75 and -2.00 diopters so he put me at -1.75 for this new pair that was ordered. While the vision isn’t 4KHD, I could still read the letters he was asking me to read, even if a little blurry at that distance in that eye.  The cylinder is now down from -1.25 to -.50 or -.25 in that right eye (I can’t remember which one he said).  He explained it is about getting me comfortable at this point since I keep having that strain and he believes it’s the cylinder. When he ups the cylinder on that right eye, the letters on the chart are crisp and ultra clear, but it feels like it’s pulling or wonky. He also said he hopes that my eyes can hopefully get used to this new prescription. The optician also did some measurements with my frames on and “raised the centers slightly.”

I’m 32 years old, fit and in shape, and my recent blood panel tests two months ago for work came back with (to quote my PCP doctor) “great and normal results”. In the past 2-3 years I have changed my diet, exercise more frequently, stabilized at a healthy weight, got counseling, and improved my overall lifestyle and quality of life. I’m not on any medications. I bring this up because the doc asked if anything changed in my health. He said my vision had gotten somewhat better from looking over my history. And that this can be an art at time rather than an exact science. He didn’t really know why this sudden intolerance seems to be the issue. 

Has anyone ever seen someone suddenly not tolerate astigmatism correction in a pair of lenses that have been fine for a long time, or suddenly have sensations of being “overcorrected”?

Shout out to my doc that explains things so well that I can relay all this information with hopefully correct terminology.

ccbupa,"Central Serous Chorioretinopathy , Retinal Adema","Hi everyone - hoping someone can share their knowledge, experience, or expertise with Central Serous Chorioretinopathy or Retinal Adema (my doctor mentioned both). I've been diagnosed with the condition about a month ago and had a test to confirm (the fluid injected in my my arm - unsure what the procedure is called). Ive also received a focal laser photocoagulation treatment to the eye about a week ago - the Dr. recommended it - but the symptoms have not improved. The laser treatment only took a minute but really irritated my eye, but doesn't seem like anything improved and I'm hoping it didn't make it worse.

I've always had good vision, never needed glasses, etc, so having this condition has really messed me up at work and in my personal life ( I work at a computer all day and reading the screen is difficult with a half blurry eye and I play tennis, which makes tracking the ball extremely difficult). I catch myself closing th bad eye regularly just so I can focus in on what I'm doing or reading. Needless to say it has been challenging to go from good vision to 50 percent of my regular vision.

Does anyone know how what else I can do to help improve this situation? I feel helpless and almost feel like it will never heal on it's own, particularly because it came out of nowhere. Every morning I wake up hoping to see normally again, but to no avail thusfar.

My husband likes to mess with her nearly every morning by hitting me with a pillow or just poking at me while trying to wake me up. She never bites just barks a bit and ends up doing more harm to me by jumping all over me to get between us and that includes jumping over my face. It is honestly cute or at least it was until this morning when I turned my head with my eyes open at the same time as she jumped over my head and she got me in the right eye with her nails. 

I’ve thought I have had a scratch in my eye before but I had NO idea!! After a couple hours of sharp, stabbing pain (I imagine having a knife shoved through my eye would feel similar), uncontrollable eyelid twitching, and extreme watering all further aggregated by light, I called my optometrist who was able to see me right away. I was given some numbing drops while there and told they would wear off shortly unfortunately but I enjoyed it while it lasted. She said I have a rather large abrasion that is shaped similar to a “W” and that my dog “really got me.” 

She placed a contact bandage and told me to leave it in (including sleep) for 24 hours and then I could remove it. 

I was prescribed antibiotic drops especially due to the fact I was scratched by an animal which elevates the risk of infection. The pharmacy had to order the drops so I won’t be able to pick them up until tomorrow. 

She told me that taking ibuprofen and Tylenol concurrently would provide the best relief and that I could take 1000 mg Tylenol with 800 mg ibuprofen during the first day or two (at most). I did that combo right after my morning appointment but only recently took 400 mg ibuprofen with no additional Tylenol because, well, I like my functioning liver. I’m always paranoid about taking meds.

This feeling is pure hell but I think I will manage. I have just a few minor questions, though.

1. I work at a computer daily with two monitors. I dimmed both monitors, turned off my fluorescent office light and used only a desk lamp, and wore sunglasses inside all day. It made the discomfort tolerable enough. However, is computer work at all detrimental to the healing process? 
2. Similar to above, is it better to carry on as normal or should I purposely be resting my eye with lid closed? I’m afraid my eye will dry during sleep but hopeful the contact bandage will help prevent undoing any overnight healing by opening my eyes in the morning.

I suppose I’m concerned that staring at a computer all day may not be the best idea.",2,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/cdqgi5/corneal_abrasion_caused_by_dog_scratch_few_minor/"")",2019-07-15 18:27:49,

She got a gas bubble put in as well as a buckle. I do believe the doctor said something about a laser as well. She’s going to need to keep her head down for a while so the bubble stays in place where it needs to be. 

We went for her follow up visit the next morning and the doctor that performed the operation says the surgery went perfectly and that it looks exactly like it’s supposed to. I have to give her two bottles of drops 3x a day.

It can be quite tempting to escape the hassle of going to your eye doctor to get fitted for your contact lenses. That would mean: no waiting for appointments, no taking time off work or school, no commuting, no paying for doctor’s fees.

Sounds convenient? You bet. But doing so also nullifies the very measures that were meant to protect your eyes from the risks of illegal over-the-counter (OTC) contact lenses.

There are currently 45 million Americans wearing contact lenses.1 While contact lenses have greatly improved quality of life for 150 million people across the world, they’re also not without risk, especially when used with no proper medical supervision.

# Contact lenses are regulated medical devices

Corrective contact lenses were first classified as a class III medical device by the FDA in 1976, alongside pacemakers and external defibrillators. But the past 20 years has seen the rise of non-corrective, decorative and cosmetic contact lenses that regulators likely never saw coming.

Accompanying the unregulated dispensing of contact lenses was a troubling increase in cases of microbial keratitis among contact lens users.2 This prompted the FDA in 2005 to classify all contact lenses, whether corrective, cosmetic or decorative, as medical devices that can only be sold with a valid prescription from a licensed eye doctor.3

But despite federal regulation, illegal contact lenses still manage to make their way to gas stations, flea markets, beauty salons, and convenience stores and are available over the internet for as low as $5 or $10 a pair.11

These products don’t go through the rigorous process required for FDA approval, yet, 28% of those who use non-corrective contact lenses purchase them from questionable non-medical sources without a prescription from their eye doctor.10

A big part of the problem is that the majority of users don’t know that contact lenses are actually regulated medical devices until they develop a serious complication. Vendors themselves believe that because decorative contact lenses don’t correct vision, they don’t require the same level of medical care.14

What users and vendors alike don’t realize is that contact lenses are regulated not because they are corrective or non-corrective, but because of the risks that come from wearing them.

# Contact lenses are not a “one-size-fits-all” merchandise

If you’ve ever worn underwear that was two sizes too small, rest assured it’s nothing compared to wearing ill-fitting contact lenses.

Whether you need corrective lenses for your vision or decorative lenses to spruce up your Halloween costume, you will need to undergo a comprehensive eye exam performed by an eye doctor.

During the exam, the eye doctor will perform a variety of tests to determine your visual acuity and suitability for contact lenses. The doctor will also measure the curvature of the cornea to ensure the best possible lens fit.

Skipping this exam is literally sight-threatening. Ill-fitting contact lenses can not only easily scrape the surface of the eye and cause severe pain and inflammation, they also provide the perfect breeding ground for infections. In the worst case scenario, wearing ill-fitting contact lenses can lead to microbial keratitis, which is a major cause of blindness.4,12,13

All of this can occur within hours of wearing the contact lens, as has been documented in a case series published in *Eye &amp; Contact Lens: Science &amp; Clinical Practice* in 2005.11 It comes as no surprise that about 130.4 per 100, 000 contact lens users compared with only 14.0 per 100, 000 non-users develop microbial keratitis every year.7 Moreover, decorative lens users are five times more likely to develop microbial keratitis than soft contact lens users.

# Over-the-counter contact lenses are contaminated

When you talk about counterfeit and illegal medical devices or supplies, it’s safe to assume that they’re contaminated and will do more harm than good.

In 2017, the FDA tested over 300 unapproved and counterfeit non-corrective contact lenses and found that 60% of counterfeit lenses and 27% of unapproved lenses were positive for microbial contamination. At least 29 different brands were included, and 48% of them were tested positive for microorganisms associated with eye infections including microbial keratitis and bacterial endophthalmitis.8

# Professional guidance is paramount

Proper medical guidance has been proven crucial in preventing contact lense-related complications. Ironic but somehow unfortunately expected, non-compliance among patients already under professional medical care runs between 40-91%.9 This number is believed to be even higher among users of  OTC contact lenses because they never receive proper instructions in the first place, which is another good reason why you should have an in-office visit for your contacts.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;With \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Lenses , there’s no need to take a blind shot at your future. While there’s not much we can do about counterfeit and illegal contact lenses, we can offer you a clear shot at freedom and a future where the only limit is the one you make.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since being approved by the FDA for myopia treatment in 2002, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Lenses have helped 1.5 million people across 50 countries see their future without limits. Unlike glasses or traditional contact lenses, Paragon CRT® Lenses do not get in the way of an active lifestyle.

chmda7,Could my White Dot Syndrome actually be eye sarcoidosis?,"Hello everyone!

I'm a 24 year old female who is slightly shortsighted. 

Five years ago in 2014, I got a very small spot in my eye near my focus point. My eyes didn't seem infected at the time nor did I feel ill. Even OCT didn't show any abnormalities. Only a year later I got the diagnosis White Dot Syndrome. In the mean time I would get new spots daily, most of which would vanish after a few seconds. Very few stayed. If I could guess, I think in 5 years I got maybe 6 or 7 permanent spots. Most of them in my right eye.

Since the appearance of spots has been roughly constant over the past few years, I never felt the WDS diagnosis fit me very well. I did notice, however, that I seemed to have a higher chance of getting permanent spots while having a cold or feeling ill. I also get more spots that vanish after a few seconds at these times. 

One year ago I got the diagnosis sarcoidosis (Löfgren syndrome). This diagnosis fits me like a glove. They asked me if I noticed some changes in my eyes. I said, ""No. Nothing changed recently. However, I do have the White Dot Syndrome.""

Recently I was reading into both conditions and noticed they both have a thing in common: granuloma.

Some change I want to add: I wear contacts and since a few months, I will get an allergic reaction to them which makes my eyes feel tired and a little dry, but not red or itchy. Antihistamines help a lot. This might be completely irrelevant, but I don't know that haha.

Nonetheless, as I had no idea what was going on, only that my eyes would hurt when using computers. I though wearing glasses might fix the issue. Well it only fixed an extremely marginal near-sightedness (-0,5 and -0,25) for when I put it on but other than that it only had negative consequences.

I could feel that simply by wearing these newly bought pair of glasses, my eyes would hurt. Not only in front of a computer but anywhere I wore them. I thought my eyes would just need to get used to them so I decided to keep them on for an entire day. Mistake. 

When at the end of the day I took the glasses off, I would see an afterimage of a light beam for almost 10 minutes and traces of moving objects as well. Really not good.

cituos,Double Vision at a certain distance when driving,"Hi any suggestions about this? This is for my mum she's in her 80's and has this problem when driving that ""the lines on the road go crossed"" in her words but only at a certain distance away (around the mid distance - a few hundred meters perhaps). She's got glasses but they don't seem to fix it - she has astigmatism - one eye is worse. She had cataract surgery a year or so ago, but this precedes the cataracts.  She is seeing her surgeon again soon, and her optometrist but they don't seem to have helped. I was wondering if you good folk have any suggestions on how to proceed. Maybe she's just old and has to suck it up, but thought I'd give this a try. If she covers up her left eye - the one with astigmatism it goes away she says.

So last Wednesday my son woke up with a droopy left upper eye lid. He is 14 months old and had never noticed any problems before. It got better over the next 24 hours, but again yesterday I notice it has returned.

I can't see any other issues with his eye, his pupil seems fine and eyes are moving around normal as far as I can see. His behaviour is the same so I don't think he is in pain.

There is also a decent amount of pain around and behind my eyes. As well as sensitivity to sunlight and pain when I try and focus on something up close. This is been a continuing problem for a little over a month.

I have seen my optometrist (because she has been my optometrist for over 10 years and has a good idea what my eyes look like normally). She diagnosed it as episcleritis, prescribed me durezol drops. The drops worked wonders but only masked the problem as once the bottle was finished, all my symptoms came back. She then prescribed me Lotemax sm which work somewhat but those drops are more soothing than anything. 

I have also seen an ophthalmologist who also diagnosed me with episcleritis and just told me to take 800mg of ibuprofen 3 times a day.

I have seen a rheumatologist and he took a lot of blood and a urine sample and prescribed me azithromycin just to rule out infection. But we still do not know what the root cause of the inflammation could be.

First of all, I (26F with no prior eye disease except low correction glasses)  have an appointement on saturday with an eye doctor. It was the quickest I could find. My last one was early june (the first time I had glasses prescribed) 

I am fairly anxious while waiting. Yesterday morning, I woke up with floaters in both eyes. They are quite transparent, mildly annoying and it's the first time I have them. I also have a diffuse spot if light near my vision focus point. No eye redness, no pain. To be honest, I was focused on a screen all week end and really tired if that's relevant. 

It does not seem like I'm losing acuity. Maybe a little more blurry on the sides but nothing dramatic. No bright flashes.

My left eye has been hurting with varying intensity for several years now. It's always an ache at the back of my eye and i feel like i need stick my finger into my eye socket and rub it. It's always the left side.

A couple months ago I had the most intense migraine of my life that caused my left half to go numb with parasthesias. I've gone to two neurologists and two ophthalmologists. I'm frustrated because they don't seem to recognize my eye pain as something separate from the migraines, but rather that it's all together.

I have noticed lately that my pupils are different sizes, but my left eyelid (right in picture) has always been lower since I was a baby. I did notice, however, that in my MRI my optic nerve in my left eye looks bent, but the neurologist said she couldn't make any conclusion about it. The two ophthalmologists didn't look at the MRI.

One ophthalmologist wrote that I had physiological anisocoria, an optic disk disorder, and esophoria, but the other one said my retinas looked perfect (he was a retina specialist).

I have been doing a dry eye protocol at the recommendation of the eye doctor because my tears dried in 0 seconds and i have been following it to a T because I really, really hate my eye pain.

cl2kel,Peculiar eye burning,"Hi. I realize it will be difficult to tell me anything but I'm hoping for at least some course of action...  


Long story short, I woke up 10 years ago with excruciating eye pain. I couldn't look at anything for a week. It slowly went away. Ever since I've had occasional and not so occasional irritating but not debilitating eye burning when I look at things for too long. Computers, books, trees, whatever. As long as I'm staring at something. The odd thing is that some days I won't get it at all and some days it will be triggered right after waking up. I can literally look at my computer for hours and not be triggered, but some days I wake up and I can feel that simply looking at my phone for a few seconds will fuck me for the rest of the day.  


I've learned that cold or hot will relieve it a bit (I have a frozen water bottle that fits my eye sockets quite well), but nothing will relax my eyes 100% unless I sleep for a few hours. I try self massage, temperature, looking into darkness, stretching my eyeballs and eyelids. Eye drops don't help. Sometimes it will go away if I become active for a long time, or something...I'm not really sure what the true cause or solution is.  


I've been to a few eye doctors...nothing is ""wrong"". I wear glasses for distance (-2 per eye), but have since before the incident. I have Googled every once in a while forever but have never found anything that seems like my issue.

He looks at it through the device and then he goes back and takes another lens and puts THAT one in. This is a different type. That one feels a little better, he looks at it through the device and he also thinks it looks a little better so we agree to that one.

We go down to the nurse to order my lenses and he tells her to order Acuve Oasys and I say, no, I wanted Acuve TruEye and he says, oh, ok TruEye.

Now, my concern is that the second lens he put in was not a different BC, but a different model (Oasys rather than TruEye). The first one was TruEye (he showed me the label on the blister), but the second one I don't know what it was.

So supposing this is indeed the case, would this be a big problem?

cnu7ow,My right eye has been feeling like there is pressure in it and it has been feeling out of place (22m),"Hello all, to start off I am a 5’10” 140lb 22 year old caucasian male. For years and years of my life I occasionally get the feeling that something is in my right eye. This feeling can last for as long as a few hours. I went to an eye doctor three years ago who just gave me gel eyedrops and told me it should help. It barely helped. The sensation of something being in my eye finally stopped being so apparent and started happening less and less so I figured it went away. Over the past month or so I have been having that feeling again that something is in either my eye or my eyelid. 

Now we get to the real problem, about six days ago I was driving and started noticing my right eye was feeling very strange whenever I would look to my far left or far right. I figured I was just tired and needed sleep. The next day I get the same feeling as well as the feeling of pressure in my eye AND the back right side of my head (tender-ish to touch when feeling this). For the past six days my right eye has been feeling like this on-and-off and it is really affecting my life. It is making me feel like ripping my eye out of my head is the only thing that will help (obviously not doing that). I went to an Opthalmologist today and he said both of my eyes look fine and the only thing he saw was a little irritation on my eyelid , which he said may be causing the original feeling of something in my eye. He told me to use chilled eye drops and Zaditor to help reduce the minor inflammation of the eyelid, however he did not suggest anything for the major problem im dealing with. I am feeling very lost and hopeless, I really hope someone is able to steer me in the right direction on this subreddit. Apologies if my description for the way my right eye is feeling isn’t perfect, it is a very strange feeling.

co5wgn,"Floaters, Running, and Strobing Light"," Hello,

I am 34 years old. I've had floaters in my eye since I was about 26. Since then they have been pretty bad. I wear dark sun glasses all the time to mask them so that they don't bother me. The first time I got the floaters I went to the doctor and he did a dilated pupil exam on me. He said everything was fine.

This year I started running quite a bit. Sometimes after a run when I come home (darker at home or close my eyes), I'll see a white strobing light. I occasionally get this with any type of extreme cardio. I feel like the number of floaters I have has increased, but it could just be in my head (as I keep focusing on them more and more these days). I can only attribute it to the running. I went to my optometrist a few weeks ago and he did the dilated pupil exam and says that everything is fine. He said it may just be something pulling on the retina. I have booked an OCT as well.

Could physical activity such as running cause floaters or am I just getting older and my eyeballs are becoming more liquid inside? Should I be concerned about this strobing light / Can I continue running or should I hold off on it?

coemok,Questions about how to administer dexamethasone drops,"Hi everyone. My doctor didn't give me any special instructions about how to administer these eye drops (other than how many times per day), which were compounded without preservatives and stay in my fridge. The pharmacy didn't give me any special instructions either.

For my two initial doses I could tell that some of the fluid was draining through my tear ducts into my nasal passages. This is a big problem because I'm HIGHLY sensitive to systemic corticosteroids  -- I get panic attacks, insomnia, and jitteriness. I live with a mast cell disease so my body is hypersensitive to everything.

It's 2:30am &amp; I'm less sleepy than I would usually be at this hour.

Is it possible for that small amount of 'runoff' into the nose to cause systemic side effects once it gets absorbed into the bloodstream?

And I did some research online -- I'm supposed to put pressure on my tear ducts after I put in the drops, right? To prevent the fluid from entering my nose, right? I don't know why the doc &amp; the pharmacy didn't tell me that. Or maybe it isn't that important?

When the eyelid is stuck like that it feels stuck and weird and the eye feels a little irritated.

This happened once when I was outside in the sun, once in front of the computer and now once when I woke up.

cop9vu,I'm a 27 yr old Canadian dental student w/ herpes zoster affecting V1 &amp; V2 (left).,"4th yr. dental student, woke up this morning to find painful blisters at browline and nasofacial angle, with broad swelling and erythema also present along v1 &amp; v2 dermatome. First intuition was, fuck, I have shingles. Two gp's I saw at the walk in think its zoster (unfortunately affecting opthalamic) and I'm on board too (somewhat of an atypical blister appearance, bullous in my case rather than multiple vesicles). Swab from blister fluid was taken and sent to lab. Taking valacyclovir 500mg TID and prednisone 50mg QD. MD recommended that if I begin to have symptoms that suggest eye involvement (pain, changes in vision etc.) to go to emerge to get a referral to see an optho. After getting my prescription filled I went to see an optometrist to get a quick consult and establish a quicker referral line to an optho. She did an exam and doesn't see anything that suggests eye involvement....yet...as its early.

I'm praying this doesn't become HZ opthalmicus and lead to problems, because eye-deally I need two working eyes to work.....

I've been doing some reading on uptodate etc....Could I benefit from antiviral eye drops/ointments taken prophylactically? Same with cortico drops? Any other suggestions or comments for my case would be greatly appreciated :)

I can see just fine and then when I turn off the light there is a big white spot, kind of like a blind spot, in one of my eyes. It only happens sometimes and it resolves itself in a few minutes. 

Are these issues common or should I make an eye appointment? I stare at computer screens pretty much all day so I'm wondering if that is the cause.

crel2w,Moderate vision loss only in the right eye,"I had my optometrist appointment and he is referring me to a neuro-opthalmologist. I know I shouldn't freak out, but I am, a little bit. The appointment could take ages to get, so I guess I just want to understand it a bit more and reassurance.

A bit of background, I had a brain hemorrage 9 months ago and had craniotomy on my right side to clip the aneurysm. I was very lucky and not feeling too horrible.  I started experiencing right eye pain in February. Got a new prescription in April, no change in left eye but much worse prescription for the right. But that didn't reduce the pain..seems to be getting worse, but I am probably just imagining that bit. My right eye feels bigger the it should be, if that makes any sense. The pain is a constant ache, with a bit of sharp pain if I am tired. It also twitches if I am tired, heh. 

I had another optometry appointment yesterday. My right eye's prescription has gotten a bit worse but not enough to change the lens. Optometrist gave me a visual field test (flashing dots kind) and found normal left eye and right eye with ""moderate vision loss"". Moderate scared me a bit. I don't have a copy of the chart but he showed it to me. So in the circle there is a red (dots not detected) wedge/blob extending from the centre to the periphery near the horizontal line in the middle of the circle . It is not that big, only maybe around 20 degrees...  Day to day, I don't notice the ""blind"" area at all. Optometrist said the deficit is not due to any brain issues because it is not symmetrical.  My eye is otherwise healthy, a bit odd shaped and a small growth on the retina but these hasn't changed for years. So I am guessing something going on with my optic nerve of the right eye? He seemed happy enough, not too concerned, but enough to refer me on. What should I expect from the neuro-ophthalmology appointment? I am guessing another visual field test.

crkke1,Macular deformity/mass,"Hello! Not looking for a diagnosis, but maybe some generalized information. 

I have a son, 10 years old, who was born prematurely (28 weeks). About 18 months ago we noticed that he was getting extremely close to items to read them (within the 5 inch range) and had not really noticed it before. Caveat: Assume this could be poor parental observation or recently started issues.

Sometimes his vision seems (to us) like it isn't bad but sometimes it is terrible. Reading normal sized dark blue font on a white background on a computer monitor he says is light blue and sometimes the letters aren't there. In an eye test yesterday reading 20/100 letters on the chart he said was ""just white"" when viewed with one eye and couldn't make out all the letters with both. He's also mentioned colorization that doesn't match with what we see (generally blue/green)

First ophthalmologist told us nothing was wrong; he was just trying to get attention.  
Second opthalmologist told us his eyes were healthy; it was neurological.  
Third ophthalmologist told us that it might be related to premature birth and to see a neurologist.

We were on a rather long waiting list for a neurologist and moved to Sweden. We just went in yesterday and the ophthalmologist noted what he thought was an edema in both eyes in the macula; his images were low-res so he sent us to another clinic where the Chief of the eye clinic was on site. 

He did a higher definition scan of the eye and said that there were indeed macular defects/mass under both eyes - and that he is assuming they must be genetic due to them being almost exactly centrally placed and the placement and size being uniform and that they will need to do a full workup to determine what it is and whether it can be treated. I am waiting for the documents to be sent to my house, so I don't have a copy of the HD scan yet - I took a camera picture of the lo-def shot here  and both eyes are the same. The angle of the photo isn't good, but it's the only one I took for now.

Does anyone know what the possible outcomes I could look into for preparedness? Specifically related to pediatric issues with macular masses; bonus if they meet the same criteria of uniformity and placement. My main concern, obviously, is that this may be a progressive issue leading to blindness, but this may be due to the fact that any Google search inevitably leads to the dire links.",7,10,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/crkke1/macular_deformitymass/"")",2019-08-17 03:31:43,

I’ve never worn glasses, but I got an eye exam done a couple of days ago, and was told I had “perfect vision“, nothing concerning in the retinal exam, and was seeing 20/20. However, I was still given a prescription for glasses with .25 and .50 in either eye. At the time I figured I’d trust the optometrist, but the more I think about it, the less sense it makes to me (why do I need glasses if my vision is “perfect”?). I mentioned that during both of the times where I was asked to read up close with only one eye, my left eye underperformed, and after a few seconds my vision would slowly go dark until I was able to blink again. That didn’t happen with my right eye. Granted I was still able to read the text with my left eye, but it was way harder to focus.

I know this is probably quite a common and low risk issue. But this morning I rubbed my eye and 2 large eyelashes fell off, one went onto my nose and the other went into my eye. 

I went to the bathroom to get it out and I had it in my grasp, it was towards the top of my eyeball, I then reset myself and blinked and it was gone. 

I have quite long eyelashes and this was one of my large eyelashes even at that. I tried splashing loads of water in and it didn’t resurface. Eyedrops as well. 

I’ve had my girlfriend look into my eye in all corners and she couldn’t see it.

I don’t really feel any irritation but it does kind of feel like something is there somewhere - whether that’s just from splashing all the water in I don’t know.

I even got a second opinion and they both agreed I have about the same prescription. However, my optometrist decided to give a little astigamatism correction for my right eye this time.

csrf16,Stubborn GPC - what's my next options?,"It's been a long journey so I'm sorry if it's a long post.


Female, 27 y/o, no allergies. 


I've had GPC, or more like contact lens related papillae for a while. I know it's not a big deal most of the time and that a lot of contact lens patients have them at some point. Back in June last year they were at a 0.5 grade. We just kept a note of it, was advised to just in case keep an eye on how long I'm wearing my lenses, and that's all.


In November I had another check up as I kept feeling my lenses move every time I blink, and General uncomfortable feeling with them in. Lids everted, and suddenly we're at grade 2 LE, 1.5 RE. 


Since then we've tried the standard methods of fighting with those buggers: topical antihistamines for a month, didn't do anything. Topical mast cel stabilisers, didn't do anything. We put me on a ban for contact lens wear for 2/12, it seemed to help a bit, so they refitted me from Dailies Total 1 to Miru 1 Day, reduced wear time (ie only when I really need to). I thought we had it under control, we were at grade 1 BE. 


Now in June my eyes hit me again. At first I thought they were just exceptionally dry, and with the heatwave I just assumed my tears were just evaporating like crazy. But then every blink started feeling like sandpaper. So I knew what it meant.


Lids everted, back to grade 2/2.5 (tear prism and TBUT quite bad as well so that would explain the MY EYES ARE SO DRY feeling). So lubricating drops, antihistamines, contact lens ban, all over again. 


Now, middle of August and its not better. My eyes still feel meh. Like, I get it. It's just some papillae. It's not about to ruin my sight, just deal with it, wear your specs. And I really don't mind wearing my specs, it's just that my eyes don't feel good, they constantly feel scratchy, and uncomfortable.


I've been told to try mast cell stabilisers for another month and see how it works, but I just don't see why it would work this time if it didn't previously. Or maybe it will and I'm just a negative Nancy. But if someone can give me some other insight, I'd be grateful because honestly I just want to ideally replace my eyelids if that's possible at all.",1,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/csrf16/stubborn_gpc_whats_my_next_options/"")",2019-08-19 19:12:26,
ct0dt0,Right eye peripheral flickering/flashing,"I work on a computer screen 8 hours a day 5 days a week.  I have been working here for 2 years now (started October 2017).  I noticed my vision deteriorating and having issues looking at my screen after a year (around september/october 2018). I also noticed a flash/flickering in my peripheral right eye that gradually got worse and worse.  It was almost unbearable to view my screen and could barely see any of text without squinting or getting really close to the screen (which I never had problem with until a year into the job). I went to an optometrist around late December and they said I had astigmatism in my right eye. I got an eye scan and they said everything is fine. They prescribed me glasses with a blue light filter and said the flashes were due to ocular migraines.    

I received the glasses a few weeks later and they helped a lot and the flashes/flickering went away for awhile but eventually they came back and now it's back to being unbearable at some points.  I noticed it was due to light.  I also feel a little irritation if any light is involved with my right eye.  I went to an ophthalmologist to get a second opinion. She said everything is fine.  She thought it was due to PVD.  I looked into that and it said typically it goes away after a few months and it has been a year.

I noticed that the flashes will start from light and I also notice it after physical activity.  I am not sure what to do at this point.  It really bothers me throughout the day.

ctb7q7,Tilted Vision - Have not been able to get a diagnosis.,"Hello, I have been suffering with (in my opinion) an extreme amount of tilt in my vision. It has been progressing since I was 18, I'm in my late 20's now, and I have never been able to get it diagnosed. Most recently I went to an ophthalmologist who thought it was caused by my astigmatism. I had 5.5 diopters in my left eye, and 2.7 in my right eye. He told me the large amount of astigmatism in my left eye, along with the large difference between the amount of astigmatism in both eyes was causing the tilt. He recommended Lasik to fix it. I went through with the Lasik but while my vision is much clearer in my right eye, my left eye still has 2 diopters of astigmatism in it so while still blurry its better, it has had no effect on the tilt whatsoever. I have told this to my doctor but he said my eyes need to heal before they can do any more tests. However at my 1 month check-up a different doctor saw me and when I told him about how the tilt still wasn't fixed he reacted with confusion, not knowing about the problem, and guessed that it might be a muscle issue or that it might still be my astigmatism because my astigmatism goes all the way to the edge of my cornea and so therefor outside the treatment range of the laser. But he gave no further ideas as to what I should do next. So now I'm waiting for my 3 month check-up, having made sure the original doctor is who will be seeing me, but I'm very frustrated. 

So now I made this image so I can show doctors what I'm dealing with because apparently I'm not doing a good enough job describing it. The top picture is the unedited photo for reference. The middle photo is what I see with both eyes. The tilt is in both eyes, but is slightly different in both eyes. The lower left image is what I see in my left eye, and the lower right is what I see with my right eye.

ctdkwl,Amsler Grid - left eye - blur moving toward center,"OK so I'm an old guy I suppose. 51.  My symptoms started about a week ago in earnest.  When I was looking as the url address in chrome I noticed that the border line below the address seemed to have a slight wave in it.  When I tried to locate the wave in the line, it disappeared in my central vision. 

A few days of this and it got really perturbed so I googled and found out about the amsler grid.  My mother had uncontrolled and medically unmanaged diabetes in her 70s and she got macular degeneration if I recall correctly.  So of course I start stressing out and check out the grid.  My right eye was fine.  My left eye showed pinched and skewing lines in the bottom right hand side of the grid about the size of a dime.  I called my doc and was seen immediately by a optician who super dilated my eyes.    

During the intake they did the puff test, scanned my retina and checked everything out before the exam.

I had an routine eye exam incidentally about 2 months ago. 

So the optician checks my retinas out and can't find a dang thing with the retina. Says it isn't macular degeneration and if it was it would be atypical presentation.   Looking at the scans of my pigmented epithelial layer (?) she notices that there is some scar tissue in the left eye and the epithelial layer has gotten swollen around this small area. She then compares them to the scan taken two months ago.  And then she asked if I was under stress.   She told me that that particular layer can be inflamed due to stress.

OK so she set me an appointment with a retina specialist in a month.  Said to go home and de-stress (haha) Call them if anything changed and to check the amsler grid daily.  

The wave has gotten less prominent however it is still there.  I also noticed that the pinched area on the amsler grid has gone from the size of a dime to about half that size, maybe a pea, but the catch here is that the disturbed area on the amsler grid has moved closer to the center.  If you could divide the distance from the center dot to the bottom right corner in to four equal lengths, the location of the first blur was about 3/4 away from the dot.  Now it is 1/4 away from the dot.

I have no idea what gives or what would cause it to change location.

Am also pre-diabetic with pretty well managed blood sugars.

Also have experienced green tracers during sleep that resolve on my retina for the last 15 years intermittently.  No  optician knows what it is.

Oh the area that has some scar tissue on my left eye was due to a pop bottled lid exploding and hitting my eye.  It bruised my retina back in 1990 and has been seen by opticians ever since.

cua49z,Ophthalmologist suggested nystagmus but wasn't sure so asking here....,"Apologies if this is a faux pas here to ask medical questions.

I've developed this very strange problem within the past year. Sometimes focusing on something in the distance (50+ feet) is difficult. Randomly happens, but I notice it most at night.

I can feel each eye struggling to focus. Like a pressure in my head trying to push the eyes in opposite directions. It'll cause nausea if I let it continue.

Squinting doesn't help, but covering my eyes with a cap bill or hands as if you're trying to focus on something in the distance during bright sunlight will. Covering the vertical periphery seems to help.

I'm asking here for answers because I couldn't focus on a skunk 100 feet away while walking the dogs tonight until he got much closer. I had no idea what I was looking at until then. 

Anyway, I told everything to ophthalmologist and he was mostly stumped but wrote it off as nystagmus. Did all the standard eye tests with some others to rule things out.  Nothing was obvious. 

Is that accurate (nystagmus) and what would that mean for me? What's my next step to fix this issue or how to live with it? Is there a different name for this condition?

cuw10n,Possible infection after strabismus eye surgery,"( Mooved from ophtalmology )

Hi,

So, sunday, I got operated for strabismus on both of my eyes at 9 a.m., and everything was doing fine. My eyes got better everyday, and I stopped taking pills for the pain ( prescribed, of course ) thursday. Today ( Saturday ), I looked at myself in the mirror because my eyes were getting clearer, and I noticed that there was a small area around my iris that was yellow-ish. This said, I really freaked out, because they said that if there is any yellow secretions I had to call the doc immediately. So, because of the system in my country I couldn't really see an ophtalmologist anytime soon, so we went to see my grandfather which has been and oncologist for over 40 years, and he looked at my eye, and there were in fact, some yellow secretions under my eye.

Since there wasn't lots of it, he said it wasn't really bad and I should keep using my antibiotics ( Which I was using two times a day like they told me ) and see how it goes. One of my neighbour is also and ophtalmologist and she'll be back monday so I'm going to go see her.

EDIT : My eye doesn't especially hurt, in fact, neither of eye hurt and at this point, on my 6th day I have pretty much recovered a normal vision I really posted this here just too make sure, and I gave as much information as I could.

He recommends Symfony IOLs, with a 30% chance of follow-up PRK needed on my right eye, 10% chance of PRK on my left, due to the previous RK surgery.  He insists I will have 20/20 vision after the follow-up PRKs are done, if required.

To be more specific, I asked him for 'the clearest possible vision from 28"" to 100', and I have no problem with having to wear reading glasses for the 12"" to 14"" range.  Emphasis on 'the clearest possible vision'.

cvhum8,Slightly Darker Spot in Vision,"Hi All,

About a week and a half ago I started having strange symptoms in (I think) one of my eyes. I noticed this off when I was looking out into a morning blue sky from a dark room I entered. There was a tiny patch of my vision, right in the center only barely up and to the left, that lit up like a Christmas tree for a second, then went away. You know in MS paint there was that spray painting tool? It was like that, except shining lights. I looked back and forth a couple more times and by the third or fourth time it stopped doing it. Since then, if I stare into bright lights from a non-bright surface, I get those sparkler things pop up. Always in the same spot, and always very briefly. After a few days of that I noticed that there was a barely perceptibly darker spot where that phenomenon was occurring. If I close my eyes I can see that spot, and it's slightly larger than where the sparkler effect occurs. I went to an opthomologist and they dilated my eyes and did a few tests. My eye pressure was fine, and they scanned the back of my retinas. No signs of anything there. No sign really that anything was wrong, physically, with the eye itself. 

I noticed this after coming back from a business trip. I am terrified of planes and had to take two to get home. I noticed this phenomenon a day or two after that trip. I also think I have been battling a sinus infection due to head pressure I have been having, just putting that in there in case it might be causing this. Also if it could be relevant I had lasik about 10 years ago. The vision in my eye is 15/20, and other than that slight off-color spot no other vision issues (blurry vision, double vision, etc.). 

Basically I am hoping it is not a degenerative issue as I would think the opthomogist I saw would had noticed it, and I am only in my 30s, but she did not seem to really know what was causing the phenomenon I am seeing.",2,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/cvhum8/slightly_darker_spot_in_vision/"")",2019-08-25 19:12:11,
cvmmsf,Vitreous Hemorrhage,"The ""ink"" I saw squirting into my eye over the past month turned out to be vitreous hemorrhages.  My optometrist missed this, but I ended up going to a retina specialist when it happened again on Friday.

He wasn't the best communicator, and with my ADD I missed much of what he did say.

I do know he said my retina looked good, and to reduce activity, and to sleep as upright as possible.  He wants me back in two weeks.

Questions:

Is the fact the ""ink"" bleeds all appeared to come from the same area relevant?

Will I/my doctor know when the vitreous is completely detached?  

I've read vitamin c shows some promise in clearing vitreous bleeds.  Is there any danger in taking a vitamin C supplement?

cvxkh2,Blue Light Filter Question,"Hi all,

I came here in search of a more professional opinion on blue light lenses in general.

Some background: 

I am 27M with fairly poor vision (-6.50 in my worst eye, I believe), astigmatism in both eyes, and pigmentary dispersion syndrome. Other than that, all is normal and well. My question stems from a major life change that is having negative effects on my vision. I recently switched jobs from maybe 3 hrs per day of computer screen time to 9+ hrs per work day. This is on top of my home life where I am a typical person that games, watches TV, and uses a smartphone regularly. I noticed that my eyes were significantly more fatigued once I started this job, and I sometimes have trouble focusing, which presents as blurred vision, but I have no trouble at all sleeping. I try the 20-20-20 rule and such, but I forget often as I dig into my work.

I had an exam (since starting my new job) and my eye doctor said all is normal as defined previously. I asked him if blue light lenses would help with my digital eye fatigue, to which he responded with skepticism. He said they're proven to help with sleep, but there is no sound evidence that they help with digital eye fatigue or prevent damage from blue light, despite the one study that says otherwise. His sales staff member had an entirely different story and swears they are a cure-all for my woes, but I am not so sure. I did some independent research and I am inclined to agree with the doctor. 

So, will blue light lenses help at all with digital eye fatigue? Also, is there any research that indicates it may do more harm than good to block out a significant amount of blue light? I'd like to stay alert and awake during the day, and I do not currently suffer from sleep issues. I apologize for any glaring gaps in my knowledge of the subject - my expertise is very far removed.

cwspyj,"Yes, artificial tears will help your watery eye.","Quick rundown of why this is the case. I know it’s counterintuitive. 

The eye surface should always be moisturized with a thin layer of tears. That tear layer ought to stick to the surface evenly on its own. In lots of people, it doesn’t. Instead, it either evaporated off the surface or it rolls right off the surface and down your cheek. 

Most people call this dry eye. I had a mentor once who hated that term. For good reason! It’s confusing. “How can my eyes be dry if they’re watering all the time?” He (and I) prefer instead the term “dysfunctional tear syndrome.” Your tears aren’t sticking to the surface of your eye like they ought to.

cx8pa3,Pediatric Strabismus Surgery vs Therapy,"My daughter (28 months) developed strabismus somewhere between 18 and 24 months old. It was mild enough that her first ophthalmologist failed to diagnose it despite seeing her three times (at 13 months, 16 months, and 22 months). We finally took her in to a different ophthalmologist at 24 months because the eye crossing had become apparent to just about everyone who met her. She definitely has strabismus of some kind and is farsighted (+2.5) equally in both eyes. Only one eye is crossed, and she is still able to track well with the ""bad"" eye if her good eye is covered up. 

Because her vision is the same in both eyes, the Dr. said patching was not indicated and prescribed her glasses instead. She wore glasses for 3 months and just got back from her follow-up appointment where her eyes were still crossed. The ophthalmologist says that now surgery is her only option. 

We already have appointments scheduled for second and third opinions (one is an ophthalmologist, and another is a ""vision therapy"" clinic). Before then, I want to prepare myself with as many intelligent questions as possible. Right now the main questions I plan to ask are:

1) Do we have time to try vision therapy first, or did we already miss the window due to the stupid delay in diagnosis??

2) If we give therapy 6 months to work and \*then\* do the surgery, will that lessen the chance of success because she'd be almost 3 by then, or would it increase the chance of success because her brain will be more ""on board"" with what it needs to do?

But I also feel like I just know absolutely nothing about strabismus, and I want to go in with more intelligent questions so we can give her the absolute best chance of retaining binocular vision.

My current prescription is -4.75 myopia and -2.0 astigmatism which was -1.5 3 months ago and nowadays I see distances little blurry and I don't have the luxury to visit an ophthalmologist often due to my family being cheap. I've started to use eye lubricant just in case I have eye dryness ( feels like I have especially after waking up) I have Systane and Tears Naturale II which one should I use? And Yes I feel guilty every time I use them because they have BAK and BAK is an ocular toxic :/ but I am not sure if they're effective in terms of my blur problem sometimes they make me see clear and sometimes they do not. I am worried of my myopia progression I can't imagine my eyes when I get old I don't want retinal detachment etc :( also another new problem caused my eye-anxiety to go up which is floaters and visual snow there was always floaters but never as this frequent and I've never had visual snow before and I can't see the blue of sky normal now. I know there is no treatment of visual snow yet but Is there anything that I can do to decrease visual snows? Should I take lutein maybe that can help? or to slow down my myopia progression?

czsp4m,Can’t see up close with glasses/contact lenses,"I’m nearsighted so I have to wear glasses. I’ve been wearing glasses for about a year now, but I don’t wear them all the time even though I should. I only wear them to see the board in class and I take them off to read and write because I can’t see up close with them. I can see things fine up close with out the glasses, but when I put them on I have to “flex” my eyes. If I put a book 3 inches away from my face while wearing glasses I literally cannot see a single thing no matter how hard I “flex” and it hurts my eyes. If I put a book 6 inches away from my face I can read it if I “flex” but not when my eyes are relaxed. This wasn’t really a problem because I could just take my glasses on and off during class, but now I have contact lenses and I can’t do that (I still have the same problem with the contact lenses). I’m starting school tomorrow and this is going to be really annoying. 

Anyways, is this normal? Will it get better if I continuously wear my contacts or do I just have to live with it?

cztsyh,Given dilation drops early in eye exam and questioning if that was right. Please advise.,"I had an eye exam today, and for the first time I was given dilation drops before the acuity testing (the is A better than B, does 1 or 2 look sharper, and so forth). The drops were put in, and I sat for about a half hour while they took effect before the doctor came in to see me. This didn't seem right, and I should have questioned it but I didn't. She did the acuity testing, though it seemed a quicker than it's ever been with fewer readings. Then she used the super-bright light to look into my eyes, and I was a little surprised that she was done already.

To further add to my skepticism that it was done right, she said my prescription got a little better and wouldn't be quite as strong. I'm 53M and have worn glasses for 40 years, bifocals for the last 8 years, and every time I've renewed every year or two so far the prescription has had to be bumped up a bit, not down.

This was my first time to this center, because for the first time in my life I have a job with vision coverage. The exam was fully covered, but the premium prices in their optician's section were double what I'd previously paid at Walmart two years ago even with the insurance deductions. So I got my prescription to go and be filled elsewhere. I will put the numbers here from this prescription and my previous. Today the numbers were:

OD: Sphere -7.75, Cylinder +2.00, Axis 106, Add +2.25, Nothing in Prism or Base

OD: Sphere -8.50, Cylinder +1.75, Axis 082, Add +2.25, Nothing in Prism or Base

In January 2017 my numbers were:

OD: Sphere -5.50, Cylinder -2.25, Axis 015, Prism 1/2, Base Down

OS: Sphere -6.50, Cylinder -2.25, Axis 173, Nothing in Prism or Base

d0clg4,Thick Corneas and Glaucoma,"I recently saw an Ophthalmologist after an Optometrist noticed bilateral RNFL thinning and noted a cup/disc ratio of 0.50 on my report.

My pressures were 21 in each eye, but corneal thickness was 611 in one eye and 606 in the other. I’m told this thickness gives a false high reading?

My ophthalmologist noted the thinning was minor and believes what is being picked up on is natural variation. I had an x-Ray of each eye. He showed me a “pie chart” picture for each eye, there were two red segments at the top of each chart. He said the fact it’s the same in each eye is also indication it’s not glaucoma?

I am seeing him again in 6 months to be sure.

Is anyone able to further explain what is going on? Does anyone have more information about variations in RNFL thickness in absence of glaucoma?

The main concern is my first job that I am going to start in a few weeks (the jobs going to be  like 70  hours/week  of writing code but it pays over 6  figures so I don't want to give it up plus I have already delayed it as much as I could)

I have been living with double vision for about 6 months already but haven't found a way to manage it to  the extent that I will need to for a programming job. My current way of getting any reading done is to take my glasses off (this  helps  tremendously) and then bringing the object like just inches from my face (at this distance I see one image and can work with it). If its something like a movie, I will wear my glasses and simply keep one eye closed (but this gets pretty painful after an hour even with alternating eyes). I tried  eye patches(this is what the  surgeon told me)  but  then my eyes start  trying to merge the black of the patch with whatever my other eyes looking at,  also  I  really do not like wearing the eye patch in front of other people.

So I was wondering if there are any other options for me or if I just need to tough it out with a pirate eye  patch  for  8  months.

d1522u,Surgery for Pediatric case of Alternating Esotropia (40 - 50 prism diopters),"I posted last week asking for advice for my daughter ([Pediatric strabismus surgery vs therapy](https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/cx8pa3/pediatric_strabismus_surgery_vs_therapy/)) and got so many great replies - thank you! Since then we went for a second opinion from another ophthalmologist just to confirm the diagnosis, which he did. So we're definitely proceeding with surgery, scheduled for later this month, but I have some questions.

Brief summary: daughter, 28 months, diagnosed with alternating esotropia and farsightedness (+2.5) in both eyes equally, prescribed glasses which she wore (and still wears) full time for three months. Eyes still crossing at 40 or 50 pd.

We decided to have the second-opinion Dr. perform the surgery, because he's at Children's Hospital, and has a lot more pediatric experience (as will the anesthesiologist). My concern is whether the Dr. has enough information to perform the surgery? They did not dilate her eyes during the exam. What kind of measurements would you expect to need in order to straighten out the eyes? I would think it would have to be pretty darn precise? He did mention something about ""maxing out"" the surgery due to her extreme PD, that anything above 40 is basically the max. Is that why they don't need more precise measurements, or should I expect them to take more measurements before cutting?

Even small effort makes my eyes hurt, so I almost can't read nor use any electronic devices. This state progresses with time. In the last year I have been having severe headaches every time I overuse my eyes. Now eyes are so strained, that I almost always have a headache. It's difficult to look in general, such as when driving, doing shopping, talking to people.

I exactly remember, when the problem began. I overloaded my eyes preparing for a test. Ever since then they are always strained (feeling like the eye muscles are cramping, or like if something is squeezing my eyes). Even smallest effort causes dull pain at the back of my eyes. If I continue to strain them the pain becomes sharp.

During this time over fifteen different doctors (ophthalmologists, neurologist, neuroophtalmologist, otolaryngologist, optometryst) examined my eyes and haven’t found any problems. Besides several eye exams I had brain MRI, blood test for leucocyte, vitamin D and thyroids, CT of sinuses. The only problem they have found is mild convergence insufficiency but it can not cause such severe symptoms.

I tried treating convergence insufficiency. I was doing some exercises (using brock string and some mechanized equipment). Also tried a few kinds of glasses (with prism and also Neurolense technology). Nothing helped.

Also I have dry eyes and use eye drops “Restasis”. They help with dryness, but don't eliminate the other symptoms.

d35vgo,Blurred vision despite several rechecks and adjustments to my glasses prescription.,"Dear All,

I have been struggling with blurred vision for over a year. 

At first, I was struggling to see text at a distance. I visited the optician who performed an eye test. He saw the prescription, which had a lower spherical power, and did not advise any change to the prescription. 

A few months later, I visited the optician again, this time a different one. The optician advised a prescription change and I ended up buying new glasses from their store. I bought the lenses without any thinning or antireflective coating. I didn't like the glasses because of glare, so I got another pair with the necessary changes. 

However, there was a problem. I was experiencing blurred vision with the new lenses when reading anything, even at arm's length. I visited a doctor who said that this problem was to do with anxiety. Convinced that this was not the case as I was experiencing blurred vision all the time, I visited the doctor again after a few months who advised me to have a recheck. 

So I had a recheck and then had a slight change to my eye prescription. I was still experiencing blurred vision.

I visited the doctor again who referred me to an ophthalmologist and orthoptist. The ophthalmologist did an examination and said that I have lattice degeneration, but this does not cause blurred vision. He told me to go back to the optician and have another recheck, saying that this was due to refractive error. I visited the orthoptist who did not notice any problems with my eye muscles and gave me a few eye exercises which she believed were 'not necessary' but I could practice them. 

I visited the optician again for two rechecks. I was given another change to my prescription and am awaiting my glasses.

All of these changes have been less than a diopter. My old glasses are about a diopter stronger than my new glasses and I see more clearly with them. This is very unusual. 

The stakes are quite high. I barely passed my previous exams and if this keeps going on, this will cost me my career. 

This situation presents the obvious question. How can I resolve my blurred vision?

I would be curious to know if my plan to try and manage it at this point seems best.","I'm a 36-year-old male, in good health, good lifestyle habits. Non-smoker, drink very rarely, eat a good diet. I have no history of issues with my vision until this past month. The most recent eye exam I've had until this last week indicated 20/15 vision in both eyes. 

About one month ago I began to have a vague sense that something was ""off"" with my vision but at the time that was all I could tell. There seemed to be a slow progression of the issue, and then about 2.5 weeks ago I realized that it was my right eye which was bothering me. When I covered the left eye I had blurriness to my vision, both in looking at objects near and far away. I also noticed a dull pressure in the right eye which was present most of the time and seemed to get slightly worse along with the vision deficit. 

I felt as though there might have been a slight improvement toward the end of last week but nothing major, so I made an appt for an eye exam which was initially scheduled for this Friday. On Sunday I woke up with right-sided facial pain as well as some right eye pain which was less severe, so I called the ophthalmologist's office on Monday and reported this, at which point they said just come in that day for the exam. 

The ophthalmologist indicated that I am slightly far sighted in the right eye, and said that otherwise the exam was unremarkable. He did not see any issues with the optic nerve or blood supply, and gave me a ""whimpy"" prescription for some lenses (his words not mine, I just liked his wording). He said there would be no risk in not wearing them, but if they'd make my life easier then go ahead and get them. The only other thing I can think of to mention is that I told him the dilating drops caused me pain in the right eye only which seemed to really be noticeable when I was moving the right eye around for that portion of the exam, but he said this was not a concern. I also noticed that the dilation caused a much greater effect in the right eye and that the effects lingered much longer in this eye as well, though I suppose that's also not a concern. 

As of Tuesday I felt like my vision was a lot better, which as I said above seemed to be the general trend even a few days prior. By yesterday I felt as though I had no issues at all, no pressure to speak of either, and as I type this out I cannot tell a difference in either eye at all. 

In terms of any history with eye issues, like I said my vision has always been great. That being said, the facial and right eye pain I had over the weekend has been a sporadic issue for me over the past 3-4 years. It's always on the right side, and usually the right eye will be painful when I get the worst episodes of this issue, and when it hurts the pain is mostly noticeable with lateral or medial movement although there's a sense of it being ""raw"" if that makes any sense at all. It usually fades away within a number of days, and is sometimes associated with some general fatigue as well though not always. The facial pain seems to always be consistent with the upper 2 branches of my trigeminal nerve (I'm a physical therapist so I'm fairly aware of what's going on with my body, and it seems almost certain that this is my trigeminal nerve). 

In addition to this, if it's relevant at all here's a quick medical history - 

* Parsonage Turner Syndrome, 2014. Left brachial plexus was affected. Paralysis mostly proximal, left shoulder and surrounding musculature. Good recovery which started around the 9-month mark. 
* Tourette Syndrome, onset around age 8-9
* Celiac disease

I sent a message to my PCP letting know about the issues with my vision, results of the exam, and then the spontaneous recovery. I told him that for now I would just not get the glasses because I did not see what that would achieve, especially with the fluctuation in my vision, and that I'd let him know if and when the situation recurs. His response was to let him know if it came back, and that this can often be caused by ""eye strain"". 

I like my PCP quite a bit but I thought eye strain would be an odd cause of my situation, although maybe I'm way off with that assumption. My left eye had no issues to speak of, and I haven't modified anything in terms of what screens I'm looking at while at work or at home, the lighting conditions, or anything else that I could think of in terms of changes that might lead to spontaneous improvements. The only reason I am just a little apprehensive about the situation is due to what happened when I had Parsonage Turner Syndrome, which is really rare and not something I think any doctor should latch onto as an initial diagnosis, but it took a while for anyone to come around to the fact that it was not a rotator cuff injury as it did not fit in any way with what you would see in a rotator cuff injury both in terms of the presentation or the history. I imagine if things really get worse my PCP will do a great job, but I want to make sure I'm at least somewhat prepared with as much knowledge as possible should I feel like I'm in another scenario with a provider that is convinced that it's a really routine issue despite evidence to the contrary.

d44xmv,Question about OH and blurred vision for up to 30 seconds after exercise,"Not asking for medical advice at all - more just an indication to help me know whether I should ask for a followup with my opthalmologist.

I recently had an iridotomy in my left eye for intraocular hypertension (it was around 31L/21R). On followup 2 weeks later the pressure had reduced to 21/18 which is great. I have a checkup booked for a year later, but the opthalmologist said to contact her sooner if I experience anymore blurred vision after intense exercise. I didn't ask her at the time what qualifies as 'blurred'.

I do experience it still, but I'm not sure whether it can be considered true 'blurred vision'. I can still see everything completely clearly, but I can see my vision pulsating with my heartbeat for up to \~30 seconds and it goes away when my heart slows down. 

I was just wondering if it's normal (without OH) to experience at least a bit of pulsating in your vision when looking at flat white/sky colours after suddenly standing up (i.e. an orthostatic effect). I don't have great cardiovascular health so my BP probably climbs quite high in those situations a few times a day, to adjust for the low pressure in the upper body. At what point does this pulsating actually cross the threshold into true blurred vision?

d4n5aw,Sclerals and night vision,"Over the last year+ I’ve tried several different hard lenses - including RGPs (Boston EO/ES, XO + Optimum Comfort) - and most recently sclerals (Onefit from Blanchard).

The goal is to correct my night vision (Halos, ghosting, tails) from post-refractive surgery. I have early signs of ectasia / surgery-mimic keratoconus , but not yet a concern - more of a ‘let’s keep an eye on it’

My new sclerals have really improved my night vision and overall comfort! - but halos, ghosting, tails are still present and have changed direction. Ghosting / tails are now directed upwards vs downwards without lenses.

I wonder if this has anything to do with the size of the optical zone? Could my vision just be catching the edge of this zone? I do see some slight ghosting (upwards) after inserting the lenses, but barely noticeable.

d51q9g,Macular Dystrophy with No Adverse Vision Impact,"Hello eye doctors, especially retina specialists!  Hoping you can share some stories of positive outcomes, because the worst case scenario doesn't always happen...!  

Do any of you have experience treating/monitoring patients with drusen deposits that do not affect vision?  My 29 yr old boyfriend has some sort of genetic dystrophy expressing as basal laminar drusen, i.e., cuticular drusen.  There are significant amounts in both temporal maculae.  He was referred to a retina specialist after a routine eye exam for a very mild prescription to help with night driving/watching TV.  The retina specialist looked at OCT and flourescein angiography imaging.  Specialist ruled out Stargardt's based on pattern and lack of other symptoms, and lab work ruled out glomerulopathy-related type.  It's not readily identifiable as North Carolina, Sorsby, etc.  No vision problems in family history.  The best description is cuticular drusen/basal laminar drusen.    

The specialist's prognosis was that since it is not affecting his vision now, there is a good chance that it never will.  He estimated the overall likelihood at about 80% chance of no issues.  The ongoing treatment plan is annual monitoring.  The specialist did say that the risk for developing CNV is slightly higher, and for that reason as well as overall eye health, my boyfriend stopped smoking, started taking a quality AREDS-like supplement, and wears blue light glasses/browses electronics in night mode where possible.  We are going to get a second opinion from another retina specialist, and also consider genetic testing.  I'm sure you can imagine that the unknown risk of vision loss is provoking high anxiety, and sometimes it seems hard to believe the specialist's takeaway message of ""you're probably never going to have vision issues from this"" when we look at the pictures and see the deposits.

So, do you have any patients, or have you heard of other cases, where drusen doesn't lead to vision loss?

Hello! I’m a 16 year old female. My prescription is -6.00 in one eye and -6.25 in the other. I’ve been wearing glasses since about 6 years old. Since starting school and getting accommodated to using my school chrome book more often and doing homework once again, I’ve noticed that almost instantly my eyes will start to hurt, then after awhile I’ll get a headache. It stops after a while after I’m no longer using the chrome book as well. My vision stays clear, but at the same it’s weird, like my eyes don’t know what to focus on, and sometimes when I’m staring at something I’ll realize my vision is blurry, I’ll blink, and my vision will be clear. I have times where this keeps happening and it’s a cycle of me blinking the blurry ness away, and then I’ll get up and do something and it’ll go away. I’m not sure what’s happening. 

To give some family history, my grandpa has glaucoma and my mother has been told she has slight cataracts. And while I don’t know the reason, my grandma on my mothers side recently had an eye removed because it caused her severe pain and she couldn’t see anything in it, it was useless.

I just want to see if this is anything I should be really concerned about and if I should tell my mother, or if it’s just something simple. School started in August.

I am a 27 year old software engineer diagnosed with posterior subcapsular cataract (steroid induced) who'll be going for surgery in 2-3 months.

People who have done cataract surgery, how is your intermediate vision now? Were you able to use laptop for a long time with minimum discomfort after your surgery?

d7ejte,Severe eye strain after very short periods of certain activities,"Short version: Reading and video games for as little as 30 minutes strains my eyes to the point where I have headaches and discomfort for the rest of the day. 

Long version/history: This is a problem that I've been dealing with for approximately 3 years now. I noticed this began when I lost a large amount of weight (185ish to 145ish as a 5'11 male) in 2016. Up until that point I had been, for several years, a voracious reader. Usually anywhere from 100-300 pages a day depending on how much time was free. Up until then, I would only experience eye strain in situations where the cause was obvious ie. 300+ pages, or a metric ton of video games, and even then it would only be very mild. Skip to ahead to today. This morning, I did around 3 hours of studying on my computer, and didn't recall anything wrong with my eyes at the time. I thought that things were going really well with my eyes today, and picked up a book that I've been crawling through. I read about 20 pages worth of this small paperback book, and am sitting here now with heavily strained eyes. Given my past experience with this, they'll be sore as hell tomorrow too. Video games have about the same effect, and I cannot figure out for the life of me why.  I just worked for 40 hours this week staring at a screen for a huge portion of that time, and had no issues to speak of.  

&amp;#x200B;

As for treatments I've tried: warm compresses have done nothing for me. Artificial tears help with the next-day soreness, but I've tried to do them before reading as a preventive thing, and didn't feel any difference. I've tried putting cold packs on them, and they're in the same vein as artificial tears where they help for the next day pain, but not anything else. In googling before, basically everyone said to go get reading glasses. They don't really seem to help at all, and the optometrist didn't really have an opinion when I told him about this problem. He did point out is that my left eye is kind of stationary. When my eyes go to track something, my left just barely moves. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I've found that does seem to help significantly is to have a humidifier spraying basically INTO my eyes while I'm playing video games, or reading. This definitely functions for me at my desk, but it's not very practical if I want to just lay on the couch and read a book, or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any experience with something like this, and can recommend something to fix this, or a specialist to go and see, it would be massively appreciated.

d8cucl,Two bad prescriptions in a row - help!,"Hello!

I have pretty terrible vision - I don’t know my exact script, but I need corrective lenses to exist in the world. Recently I went to get an updated script because my old glasses weren’t doing great with middle distance reading (road signs and such) and up close (I was taking them off for reading.) I got a new script, bought regular glasses and sunglasses, and waited excitedly.

I got the new glasses and immediately didn’t like them - I’m used to new glasses making it feel like I’m walking uphill or like everything is Too Sharp for a few days, I have had glasses for over 20 years, but these ones were BLURRY. Up close things were very sharp, better than my old frames. But anything more than a few feet away had a dull blur, and the distance was essentially a watercolor painting. To be a good sport I followed the office’s advice and wore them for a week to see if I would adjust. I didn’t.

So I went back in. New doctor, new exam. New prescription. I am three days into wearing the new glasses and I hate them. Same deal - up close is great! The distance is super blurry. If you are half a block away from me, I can’t be sure you have a face. Signs across the street are blurry. Road signs still suck. Reading a white board from a back row of desks? Nope.

The thing is, my old glasses are still way better. While I may not be able to read signs, at least they aren’t blurry. I can see that trees in the distance have leaves. People down the block definitely have faces - I may need to get closer to know who they are, but I can be certain they aren’t faceless. 

I HATE to be an annoying customer, but this is like $500 of nonfuctioning glasses I now own. They didn’t
take my PD at the second appt, but I have VR at home and my measurement is maybe only a mm off or so from theirs. They said my script didn’t change too much and one eye got better (I wish I had the numbers, sorry.)

let me start off by saying that I live in UK and that I can't really afford private healthcare so my only option is NHS.

So I had a regular eye test at an optometrist privately, and she has told me that I have slightly swollen optic nerve. Whether or not in both eyes I do not know. She has told me that to get admitted to the hospital to get it checked out it would be a 3 months wait. Looking at the possible causes of swollen optic nerve I'm not comfortable waiting 3 months. What are my options? Should I walk into A&amp;E (ER)? Go to my GP to try and speed up the process?

I also don't know how relevant this is but I've recently finished a therapy with budesonide (an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid) for lymphocytic colitis. I've also had a brain MRI for an unrelated reason at the end of May and that didn't reveal any issues.

I've had some eye issues for a few years now and all was well and being treated until recently when I've been having bouts of vision loss that my doc cannot explain. I was hoping the minds of reddit could help. Here is some context to help. Of course I can provide more info if needed. Any help is very appreciated.   


\- DXed with intermediate uveitis in 2017. Not a lot of inflamatory cells but recurrent macular edemas in the left eye. Right eye has 20/20 vision since always. I have been treated with one injection and many stint of Predforte drops. I am a steroid responder and the edemas cleared up within days of starting using drops. After a few weeks without drops, the edema came back.   


\- Did many tests. Positive for HLA B27. I have a few lesions in brain white matter but no MS symptoms (being followed by neurologist) and no optic nerve inflammation. Rheumatologist (yes, I have a lot of doctors) asked for several spine MRIs as there is a family history of Ankylosing Spondilitis. No symptoms or signs of AS.   


\- Started Cellcept in November 2018. I have had barely any inflammation in the eyes since then.   


\- I have developped a steroid induced cataract in the left eye. The right eye has been mostly symptom less this whole time.   


The problem is the following : for the past few months, I have had a pretty significant vision loss in the left eye (goes from 20/25 to 20/80 at least) that lasts a few weeks and goes away. I am unable to read a book or text on my phone when this happens. This has happened about once a month since May. I have seen my doctor during these episodes and she says she cannot find anything clinically wrong with my eyes. No macular edema, no inflammation, optic nerve seems OK...  


I was wondering if anyone might have an idea or point me in some direction as to what might be happening. My guess from research and context would be Optic Neuritis (and I think my doc thought of that as well) but I have no pain in the eye and MRIs show a normal optic nerve.   


I am hoping the combined minds of the internet could throw some ideas at this problem.

i’ve been having pretty constant headaches and occasional dizziness that started out ok but now it’s made doing normal things really annoying/frustrating. my chest pains are getting worse and i overall don’t feel so hot anymore. i’m trying to play it off and act normal but i really don’t feel well. even my coworkers noticed while i was at work. 

last night my mom saw me crying in frustration over my headaches and my clumsiness and dizziness and decided enough was enough and was taking me to the doctor in the morning

was seen by a family doctor:

-i explained the anisocoria and eye droopyness. she said she wants me to go back to the eye doctor, otherwise she’s not concerned.

-i told her about my chest pain. i said one night my chest pain was so bad i couldn’t sleep, so i tried to massage my chest and it made it much worse. she said that that means it’s simply a problem with the lining of the chest and she didn’t want to order an x-ray 

-also mentioned that anxiety can be a cause of chest pain and that i’m probably just anxious because i’m 18 and have a job

-at the end my mom chimed in about my exhaustion and told her i sleep for 15 hours at a time and she seemed unconcerned. (i agree. i’m a teenager and i sleep a lot)

-asked if i take anything for the headaches. i take 2 ibuprofen almost everyday once a day. 
-doctors orders: stop taking ibuprofen and try a little caffeine 

-she is overall unconcerned except for my pupils  and doesn’t think i have any neurological problems

-call the office if i start having problems speaking or walking but it’s unlikely 

what now? go back to my optometrist and then find an ophthalmologist? i’m just a little frustrated because i want to stop having headaches and chest pains. i’m hoping it’s something minor that just got overlooked.

I am here to consult with this community for advice and to validate whether my local doctor is giving me the right treatment. (I live in a country where education level is low and doctors with false credentials is not uncommon).

About me:

* Age: early 30s
* Gender: Male
* Habitually looking at computer screens for prolonged periods (for my job)
* Lives in an area that is prone to get dusty very quickly for some reason.
* Wears glasses for about 13 years now.
* I read books a lot.

Things I notice about my eyes:

* Can be super dry at times; burns when I force them shut.
* When I blink sometimes, it feels like there is a tiny grain of sand between my eyeball and pressing against the inside of my eyelids.
* In the mornings, when stare at the blue sky (that is gently being warmed by the rising sun), I notice quite a bit of 'floaters' in my eyesight.

My treatment:

* My ophthalmologist prescribes to me a combination of **OLOPAT** and **Patanol**.
* I was told to take Patanol for 3 months

Although Patanol does help to relieve the dry eyes, it doesn't fix my problem. In fact, my doctor does not tell me what is the cause of my condition. There has been recent allegations towards the hospital in which the doctor practices — they prescribe medicine whereby patients must continuously re-buy regularly so that it is more profitable.

db2wjs,Help! Slight difference in vision between both eyes is driving me crazy. Already saw 4 doctors. Any input is appreciated!,"Need to get some input as this is making me crazy.  

  
I have been wearing contact lenses (dailies, -3.75 on both eyes) for many years. I’ve used Acuvue, but lately I switched to CooperVision Dailies and I have been very very happy with them.  

  
About two months ago, I suddenly started having issues with my right eye. It more or less coincided with vaping out of a THC/Marijuana cartridge that made my eyes really red the next day. I obviously stopped vaping from that cartridge. I can’t assume one way or the other whether this was related or not. It also coincided with my Coopervision daily contacts running out, and going back to some leftover Hubble Contacts from when I had a subscription. However, the Hubbles were being rejected by my eyes (that’s why I switched to CooperVision in the first place). 

  
The issue is that I feel like there is a slight variation in vision between my right eye and my left eye. The issue is in the right eye. I can’t say it’s blurry, and the really strange thing is that when I try to compare the vision in each eye by covering the other one, I can’t see a difference. Sometimes, even, the left one seems like it’s a bit blurry. Lately I’ve noticed that the letters on green highway signs look sharper in my left eye than my right eye.  

  
I went to renew my prescription and get new CooperVision contacts before I noticed I had an issue (originally I just thought that my eye was rejecting the Hubble contacts. I always thought these were very low quality) but when I went back to the CooperVision, I noticed I was having issues seeing.  

  
I went to the doctor that did my contacts/eyeglass fitting and she said that I had conjuntivitis, so I should stop using contacts for a week and use artificial tears. I did this with zero positive results. Keep in mind, this is a doctor that does eye exams at a store in a mall.  

  
I went to a different one (still at one of those eyeglass shops, but somewhere else) and he said that I didn’t have any conjuntivitis, but that my eye was dry. He prescribed fluorometholone for a few days and artificial tears. This didn’t help either (in fact, I think the fluorometholone makes my vision blurry).  

  
When using eyeglasses, I was using eyeglasses that had -3.75 in both eyes, just like my contacts. I had those made last year at some point. The new prescription the Dr at the mall was: [https://imgur.com/IL6gHuI](https://imgur.com/IL6gHuI) 

  
After a couple of weeks, I went to another doctor. This time with a (more) qualified doctor at a hospital. He did refraction again, dilated my pupils, and said that everything looked good and healthy, and he said that he does not know why I was having these symptoms. He said I had the wrong prescription in my eyeglasses from last year, so he gave me a new one: [https://imgur.com/E75mwI5](https://imgur.com/E75mwI5) 

  
At this point I thought that maybe I had two separate issues: One was having an old/wrong prescription in my eyeglasses, and that’s why I didn’t see correctly when using them. The other one was the mysterious issue with my contacts. So I had new eyeglasses made. However, I ended up using the prescription from the first link above. Unfortunately, this didn’t correct the issue, although I definitely see better with those eyeglasses than the old ones. 

   
I went to ANOTHER doctor who said everything looked fine and that my eyes were healthy. He did say my eyes were more red than the typical eyes, and he prescribed something for allergies (this didn’t work either). Keep in mind, I’m a daily marijuana user, so this may contribute to the redness. However, I’ve never had problems with marijuana and eyes, and I’ve been a daily user for years. 

  
Again, the issue is a slight difference in vision between the two eyes, and I can’t really put a finger on exactly how to describe it. I just feel like something is off. So I’m wondering:   


1. Is there a big/noticeable difference between the two prescriptions from the two links above? Now I’m thinking maybe I should get eyeglasses with the second prescription as this one was made with refraction with my pupils dilated. 
2. Any clues as to what the next step can be?

dc0u7r,Rapidly Deteriorating Vision Following Trabeculectomy,"My father, who is in his 60's, recently had a trabeculectomy procedure performed for his open-angle glaucoma. Prior to this procedure, when he started noticing some of his vision decreasing, his vision registered around 20/150 with an average pressure (best I can remember) of around 17-20 while just taking Travatan and Bromonidine. He was still fairly functional day-to-day and continuing to work without issue except for reading taking longer and driving just recently being out of the question. He had also complained of some color vision loss and things looking dulled out. 

Following the procedure, now 4 months later, his vision registers anywhere from 20/500 to 20/1000 depending on what kind of day he is having. His pressure spiked to 25-35 just after the surgery. Lowered to 13 for a very short time, and now rests around 16-20 every time it is checked.

His central vision is nearly non-existent the way he describes it and his pressure keeps spiking any time they try to take him off or change the dosage of any combination of now 3 drops and methazolamide pills, even now that the bleb has opened. 

The doctor seems to have used every viable med he can think of to regulate the pressure, but has him on more drops than before and now pills, which irritates his eye to the point where he has to keep it closed whenever possible to avoid excess pain.

Has anyone heard of this significant amount of vision loss following this procedure? Any recommendations on the next steps to take, if any?

I go see an ophthalmologist who does a more in depth look at my eye and he says everything looks healthy. Again, the pain persists. I notice that my right eye sees things a smidge darker which  is especially noticeable at night.

dd7m07,If you had early onset cataracts (mid-40s),"Which IOL would you choose?

Monofocal, Monofocal/Monovision, Multi-focal, Accommodative?

Ideally the answer would be an accommodative IOL, but in the US the only one approved I believe is the Crystalens and I'm not sure how much benefit that product yields.  You read that it provides up to 2D of accommodation but some studies have show it to be as low as 0.4D.  

Are there any better accommodative IOLs on the market in other countries? I'm willing to travel. Are there better accommodative IOL nearing approval in the US or Canada? 

What about Multi-Focal IOLs?  Seems like a mixed bag to me. I hear people reporting low contrast, visual distortions, halos, etc. When they work do they really significantly reduce the need for reading glasses?

Monovision might be a decent option for me.  I wear glasses and I've had prescription shifts where I've had one eye undercorrected by as much as 1.25D while the other eye was well corrected, so I essentially had monovision in those instances.

I'm most interested in accommodative IOLs, but it seems that there's got to be something out there better than the Crystalens.

So, i experience like a sudden vision loss maybe 5 times a year. It happened today again. I started having it at my early 20's but now its more often this is the 5th time this year.

So it goes like this. Not sure why but my eyes are so sensitive to light that i lose my eyesight and all i can see is white, everything is white and i cant see anything only maybe if I focus much on a human face i can barely see his nose nothing else. Everytime i experience this, when my vision is back to normal i experience headache pain, but to be specific the pain is above my eyes and the front of the head, mostly on one side. At those moments of vision loss im desoriented,confused and just waiting for my vision to come back. Im wearing glasses with blue screen protector because i work on a computer, but today i arrived at work, i put my glasses on i turned on the computer and when i looked in the monitor because our software is all white, i lost my vision at same moment.

Sometimes i lose my vision for computer screens , sometimes when i get of the computer after working for some hours and go outside not sure why i lose it while im walking, or maybe the traffic lights are the reason. One time i just woke up , went outside to drink cofee at the balcony i lost it again. Not sure if digital eye strain i dont know what it is.

I also have these white floating stuff  (not sure how they call them) in my vision all the time. 

The doctor made me do test EEG for epylepsy, the results were totaly great. Next step is MRI. I read on the internet about Multiple sclerosis, so not sure if its it.


Sorry for my bad english its not my native language, but i need some information if anyone else have experienced this. Some of the doctors say that they think its not multiple sclerosis so not sure what to think.

deizd9,Small wave on Amsler Grid,"Hi 👋 

In short, I am a 29 year-old Caucasian male with very minimal prior/current vision impairment (very mild distance prescription only).  Four months ago, I went to an eye center for a routine eye exam- my first exam in 10 years- as I thought I might need a slight prescription to renew my driver’s license.  The OD referred me to a retina specialist due to the drusen he saw during eye dilation. The retina specialist diagnosed me with macular dystrophy, specifically basal laminar drusen/cuticular drusen, and recommended annual follow-ups/weekly tests on the Amsler Grid. Said 80% chance likely to have no vision loss.

However, for the past couple of months, I have noticed a slight wave on the Amsler Grid with my left eye in the upper right quadrant. The wave is small (a straight line the length of two tiny squares) and will move right when I focus my eye towards  it and also sometimes resolve. 

Do you think given the fact that I have cuticular Drusen, that this might be an early sign/ start of central vision loss? Could it be something else? I have been extremely stressed as of late &amp; I heard stress can cause issues with the eyes.

df2xvx,'Ocular Migraine' Differential Diagnosis,"I have been experiencing intermittent visual loss, predominantly in one eye, for fourteen months. It has happened approximately 8 times in this time span. The symptoms include an insidious onset of visual loss (generally beginning with central visual loss and progressing outward) followed by recovery of vision within thirty to forty five minutes. It has affected a single eye on each occasion with the exception of one occasion where both eyes were affected and rather than my normal central vision loss I experienced complete loss of vision with the exception of a narrow window of sight near the bottom of my usual visual window. The episodes are painless, self-resolving, and don't appear to have any triggers.

I have a history of double vision caused by a lazy eye. The double vision used to be very predictable and would occur only when I was very fatigued and when I was looking at distant objects. I also have visual snow. In August I experienced a greying of my vision and expected an ocular migraine to follow. Instead I began seeing double and have not stopped. As stated, generally my double is predictable and easily remedied with sleep. This double has differed in that it occurs at all times and when viewing things near and far (even things as close as my computer, hand, phone, etc). The double has improved/lessened over the past three weeks but still remains (before it was every waking minute, now it's probably 60% of the time).

Approximately a year ago I was diagnosed by my PCP with ocular migraines following a normal visual exam. I sought assistance again this time as I'm now seeing double in addition to the other symptoms. I got an MRI to rule out MS and am pending a visit to the neuro. The MRI showed deep white matter hyperintensities. Differential diagnoses include migraine. 

My primary question in this:

Do ocular migraines cause double vision as well? I am not finding anything that suggests they do. I understand my visual loss is consistent with ocular migraines but want to ensure I am not missing anything that could be the cause of my double vision as well.",1,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/df2xvx/ocular_migraine_differential_diagnosis/"")",2019-10-08 10:08:28,

dfb6lx,"Weird symptoms, could be one of a couple things?","Hey all! 25 y/o m here. For the last few years I've noticed double vision/ghosting both at distance (~30ft) and on screens at pretty much any distance. It's not necessarily debilitating, but it can be annoying - especially while driving at night, and it's been slowly getting more noticeable as time goes on. I can see perfectly fine (barring screens) close up, but after a certain point things just get a little.. softer? Not sure if I'd consider it ""blurry"" as it seems more like the edges of things are doubled slightly. 

I've spent tons of time researching it and definitely terrifying myself over the possibility of something major, but it seems like it's most likely either dry eyes (I work and play behind a computer almost all day every day and have for many years) or astigmatism. When performing a pinhole test, my focus seems to function properly. I can also move my brow and/or eyelids in certain ways to get my vision back to how I think it should be, but that doesn't last after letting go. 

The strangest part is that the 'intensity' of the ghosting changes almost every time I blink. My eyes feel sort of watery, sort of gooey, sometimes burn and are almost always red. I can't seem to find anything online that explains why blinking would have such effects on my vision, so I'm pretty in the dark there. I've recently purchased a bottle of Systane Complete at the recommendation of a few people on reddit, but the changes have been negligible if anything (it feels like it might be doing SOMETHING, though that could very easily just be placebo.)

Any tips would be appreciated! I'm sure my best course of action is to just get an eye exam, but I figured I'd check here before spending the money that I don't have.

dfq81r,Should I go to the ER for this?,"I was out for a bike ride a few hours ago around my university campus. It is particularly windy. Something blew into my left eye and I had the all-too-familiar sensation of something being stuck in my eye. I got home was getting a bit concerned when I didn't feel it go away. I spent several 10 minute sessions trying to flush it out with running water, holding my head at different angles each time. 

It's been a few hours since the bike ride. I still feel ""it"" scratching my left eye when I blink, or when I close my eye and rotate my eyeball from left to right. It hurts pretty acutely when I feel the scratch. My vision is still normal. ""It"" does not seem to move, though tilting my head back, with my face toward the ceiling does seem to negate the effect. Facing down enhances the effect.

dggeot,Suggestions for keeping a BCL moist overnight,"Hi all, I was recently diagnosed with RCE, and have been wearing a bandage contact lens for the past 4 weeks. In 2 more weeks it comes off. The lens is mostly a great help but sometimes it gets dried out during the night and in one case I feel like the dry lens may have contributed to a small tear which of course is not ideal. I had been using the Refresh Long Lasting Hydration drops at night because I could not find the overnight options (and I figured maybe there was not much difference). But after the incident with the tear I made more of an effort and tracked down the Refresh Celluvisc which is the overnight gel formula. I am not sure about the gel, I can feel that it coats my eye which does prevent it feeling dry but I wonder if it's an issue to use it with a BCL. It also feels like it takes a while for my tear production to kick in after getting up when I've used the gel (I have been applying Blink Gel Tears Contacts formula shortly after getting up to counteract this, but I did that before I used the gel too).

dha1ju,About subepithelial infiltrates (SEI),"I recently had a pretty bad case of viral conjunctivis. Now, three weeks later, then redness, swelling and tearing is gone, but one of my eyes is now plagued with SEI. My vision is extremely blurry in that eye, as in, I could not read or write anything if both of my eyes were like this. I have seen an optometrist and an ophtalmologist a few days ago, and they have given me  corticosteroid drops (Fluorometholone 0.1%) to apply for one week.  My questions are:

1) If I understand the science behind this, the infiltrates are essentially due to white blood cells fighting off the virus residuals in my cornea. Is that correct?

2) How long does this usually last? The half-blurred vision is giving me constant headaches. It's been about five days now and it feels like it hasn't improved at all.

3) Am I still contagious? Can the virus residual still find its way out of my cornea and onto other people?

dhd4gf,Blind spots and other issues,"I have been having various problems with my eyes and have been to my Optometrist for an appointment I made a while in advance that coincidentally was when I began to experience a few problems but no blind ""spots"" yet in my eyes, like eye pain, ""flickering"", colors appearing a shade darker. 

My Optometrist did not find anything and I did not mention anything in hopes that it might just ""go away"" eventually. When it didn't go away I made another appointment about 2 weeks later around the end of August, same establishment but different Optometrist who couldn't find anything but said I had allergies in my eyes and gave me allergy drops, to which over a month later of the 2 months I am seeing no improvements at all besides a temporary relief of eye pain.

Around early to mid-September I started to notice more floaters in my left eye, which I've always had floaters in my eyes for 4 years now, in my left eye I am noticing one new big floater and in both eyes dozens of new perfectly circular floaters, my left eye also has minor flashes now and I experienced one massive flash in my peripheral but nothing else.

It is around $80 for everytime I go to that doctor so I decided to schedule an appointment with family doctor and she could not see anything inside my eyes around a week ago in October, and here's where the main concerning thing begins, about a week ago I began to see ""blind spots"" in both eyes around the same time that are not my Optic Nerve blind spots, in particular there is one spot in my right eye between my central gaze and my Optic Nerve blind spot where I can make my mouse cursor almost completely disappear inside it. Left eye:  [https://i.imgur.com/crGOYHD.png](https://i.imgur.com/crGOYHD.png) and Right eye:  [https://i.imgur.com/a2OByzB.png](https://i.imgur.com/a2OByzB.png). The big black spots are the Optic Nerve blind spots that I put there to show that they aren't my optic nerve spots. All the small black dots are ""weak spots"" where stuff seems to go fuzzy, and I have 2 or so spots in my right eye where I can make stuff almost completely disappear in them and I think around 2 in my left eye as well. 

Just wondering where I should go from this point because it would be another $80 to go to my Optometrist again for an exam in which they likely won't even find anything wrong just like the last time, or go back to family doctor again and try to see what can be done, in which case I went for an eye exam in 2018 to the same Optometrist and he referred me to a ""specialist"" (which I am assuming would be an Opthamologist?) and to this day, 1 year and 2 months later have not received any calls from the specialist to come in for an appointment. 

To add my family doctor asked me if I wanted to do a blood test, which not sure how that would have to do with my eyes but I went to do it anyways on Tuesday and am still waiting to see the results for that so I am not sure if that would give any clues on what is going on with my eyes or I would just be wasting my time waiting for the results.",1,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/dhd4gf/blind_spots_and_other_issues/"")",2019-10-13 09:54:45,

diqlu9,Seeing sparkles and dark blobs,"Hey r/eyetriage, I have two issues that I would appreciate getting some help explaining.

First off, for over two months I've been seeing sparkles when I look at something bright. It happens both with artificial light sources and white coloured surfaces reflecting light. Basically, when I look away, or close my eyes, I see little purple and greenish sparkles in the afterimage that usually disappear in a second. It only seems to happen in my central vision.

The second issue - since mid-summer I've been noticing dark blue blobs in my vision when I enter a dark room from a well lit one. It happens regularly when I come back home from the uni - blue blobs that move around my vision and dissipate after a couple of seconds. It doesn't seem to happen in complete darkness, like when I turn the lights off before going to sleep.

I have high myopia (5.5R/6.5L) and I've seen my ophthalmologist about these issues last month - he said my eyes are physically fine (apart from the nearsightedness of course), and it could be me adjusting to new glasses, or just ageing (even though I'm only 25).

djiltf,long-term use of steroid drop for marginal keratitis,"Long story short, I have had many corneal ulcers in just one eye and lots of scarring from them, thought to be marginal keratitis.  I saw a new eye doctor with a new ulcer, who thinks I should be on a steroid drop once a day permanently to prevent further damage and symptoms.  I am worried about cataract development though.  I did have a few months this year of remission, when I wasn't working on the computer nearly as much.  A few years ago, I did simple lid cleaning twice a day on the advice of a doctor and did well for a couple of years.  I stopped the cleaning due to life turning upside down and stress and tears, and soon after developed another ulcer.  I never really resumed the lid hygiene; I guess I wasn't convinced at the time it was preventing recurrences.  I thought stress and increasing time working on the computer were contributing.

Now I want to give lid hygiene another try if it would save me from the daily steroid drops, expense, and side effects.  It also seems my current computer work is less aggravating somehow, meaning my eyes feel less dry and pretty great actually (It's hard for me to tell if discomfort I have is from dry eye or a low-grade hypersensitivity response).  I have been doing the lid hygiene the last couple weeks as well.  

I already asked my eye doctor if I really should use the drops indefinitely, and it sounded like it was preferred to recurrences and is not a big deal and just need pressure checks now and then.  I did mention I had used lotemax when I was first diagnosed and was prescribed that if I wanted, considering the cost, but otherwise, it would be pred AC.  If I must use a steroid forever, what is the current safest yet effective one?      Is there an alternative to the steroid drops to prevent recurrences, or is it truly too risky to try?

dkjr5k,risk of cataract with long-term steroid use,"Hello,

My new optometrist thinks I should use a steroid drop a day to control a hypersensitivity response that has led to corneal scarring and neovascularization over the years.  I was prescribed pred AC but when I mentioned I had also used Lotemax in the past , I was given an Rx for that as well.  IOP is being checked, more closely at first.  

I'm also worried about cataract formation.  None of my eye doctors has actually mentioned that as a possibility.  My research shows it's a worry more for oral steroids.  While the risk of increased IOP can be found, I haven't found any info on the chances of developing a cataract with daily steroid eyedrops.  I could ask at my next appointment, of course, but it's a ways off and I just wanted to have an idea.

Sometimes when I have looked down it appears too. I've never noticed this before, but it could perhaps be I'm just more self-aware.

Also, I think when I sleep in certain positions, I get more phosophenes rather than sleeping in other positions. I also remember one time in work where it was sunny and hot outside and I ended up to have some kind of aura in my pheriphral vision, which looked to be some kind of phosophones that may have lasted for 10 minutes. What's strange is that if these were migraines, I don't have headaches.

I typically do not notice these spots in the day, probably because I'm focused on something such as playing video games or anything else. But this has bothered me mentally for months.

dkwn02,Neo/Partial LSCD no contacts (please help),"(Already posted on optometry and got a good response was wondering if anyone here had any insight)

A month ago I had an eye exam that showed Neovascularization at 4 o clock and 7 o clock. I saw another optometrist who said it looked more like pannus. I have never worn contacts and the opticians said they’ve never seen anybody with neo who hasnt worn contacts. However I did get hit in the eye playing sports over 4-5 years ago (eye went red Subconjunctival hemorrhage) healed within a week, but I have had a half dozen full eye exams with an ophthalmologist and opticians in that time period of 4 years since the hit and they’ve always said my eyes are healthy and havent even mentioned neo or pannus.

I went to see 2 ophthalmologists since my neo was discovered who didnt mention pannus and said it was blood vessel growth they believe it may be due to a dry eye as I have a tear break up time of 2 seconds in the eye and what looks like MGD. But they said take eye drops and do warm compress massages for now. They believe it wouldnt be caused from the trauma from 4/5 years ago as some neo/pannus would have been picked up much sooner and this has just come about in these past 9 months. (Last eye exam by ophthalmologist Dec 2018, injury april 2015, neo picked up September 2019)

I was wondering after doing alot of research could i possibly have limbal stem cell damage from the hit which has taken 4/5 years to grow or is this not likely?

Im trying to figure out why these vessels have grown as my eye seems fine, albeit these last 9 months it has felt irritated and dry. But could it be possible ive got slight limbal stem cell damage or would this have been picked up by ophthalmologists in the past 4-5 years? Or even picked up at a recent check. 

Besides this what could it be could it just be neo from dry eye and a lack of oxygen somehow from that? Or can you have an injury years ago that causes neo now 4 years later?

[https://imgur.com/a/MT474r4#0cLBR8K](https://imgur.com/a/MT474r4#0cLBR8K)

Currently taking Doxycycline Hyclate for 3 months with little improvement. Have tried Gentamycin and AzaSite to no avail as well. I use warm compresses, eyelid wipes, systane and clean the eyes often.

I've gone to two different doctors about his problem for the past year. Literally this started last October with a eyelid pimple in one and a stye in the right eye. They told me that this is Blepharitis. Though that is the diagnosis I don't have much crust. This mostly affects my left eye specifically and it feels like the eyeball is inflamed or swollen. When it really feels swollen it feels like it hurts to look up or down. I have so many floaters floating around which change day to in shapes and sizes. They honestly resemble fungi spores. The floaters have gotten worse in the past few months to where they block texts on a phone and peoples faces when talking. When these pimples begin to show it constantly feels like an eye lash is embedded in my lid and it drives me insane with the already pain and swolleness of the entire eye sock area. 

It was only tonight that my right eye started bothering me and felt like an eye lash was in there and before showering i was looking at my eye in the mirror and noticed a weird looking what I thought was a bubble floating in the liquid as I pull my eyelid down. It seemed to be free flowing as I moved my lid. I ended up losing it but as I pulled my lid down further I saw a larger yellowish clear lipid looking pimple on the bottom most inner part of my right eyelid. That seems to be where the lash sensation is coming from at the moment.

Now for the most embarrassing part that I still haven't told my drs because I feel weird. About a year and half ago I was eating my GF out in her car when she ejaculated and it had a direct flow into my left eye. It burned and being in the car I didn't have much to wash my eye out with other than a water bottle. This is where The floaters with fungi looking structure come into play. Could this have caused a fungal infection slowly? like a yeast infection? even though she didn't have one at the time. 

Other issues. I work at a hospital so I have direct contact with patients and last year I got what I believe to be a skin particle in my left eye from a patient who was very flaky and when I mean flaky this dude moved and dust would come off of him. I did wash out my eye but not the best it should have been.

Final thing to mention. Last December two months after the eyelid pimples began I started to get crazy vertigo and the worse headaches you can even imagine. The headaches and vertigo seem to come and linger always within a day after the pimples begin to show. So it's like when my eyes flare up I expect the next day to began my migraine from hell with a tight throat thick mucus and clogged sinuses. Now I don't know if this is just craziest coincidences or there is some kind of infection that is all connected. I've been to 2 ENT's 1 neurologist 2 CT scans and an MRI to which nothing impressive was shown. 

I'm not sure what else to do to ease this or feel normal again. This is seriously impacting my life. Sorry for any spelling mistakes I'm tired and my eyes are burning.",4,8,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/dluhe3/what_kind_of_infection_is_this/"")",2019-10-22 22:07:20,

I have cataracts, and while they aren't really affecting vision yet, I can't help but think ahead to the IOL and cataract surgery.

My question is if I got my IOL to keep my distance glasses, what affect would this have on my daily life? Would I eventually need reading glasses as I get older like most people?

dn1286,Do you think I have a fungal eye infection from a tree branch? My ophthalmologist is dismissing the idea," 23F hispanic

Background: I was poked in my inner lacrimal fold with a tree branch halfway through my treatment with Neo/poly/dex steroid antibiotics for some tiny eye cysts underneath my lid. I decided to continue the antibiotic drops hoping the infection that developed would go away before i made another expensive trip to the doctor. The condition had not gotten better in a week and I am having red eyes, as well as a lot of yellow discharge throughout the entire day. I let my ophthalmologist know and he wanted to give me two more weeks with the steroid antibiotics but i told him about the risk for glaucoma with that and he dismissed me and said naah, you'll be fine. its only a tiny amount of steroid--- yet he changed his mind and gave me a prescription for drops without steroids.

The first antibiotics treat gram negative bacteria, the second treat gram positive as well as good activity against gram negative (moxifloxacin) but also $100 more expensive and very costly for me. I told him i was worried this might be a fungal infection because I got this after the \*tree branch\* which is a way you contract fungal eye infections. He didn’t seem to care and told me to just use antibiotics for two more weeks. I also told him how I thought the infection spread from one eye to the other and he outright laughed and said that is not how infection works. But I was using the same paper towel for both eyes so I don’t understand how that is so far-fetched. I also had severe vision loss (extremely blurry) in the eye that got poked and he said it was due to my dry eye. But both of my eyes are dry and I would expect to have vision loss in the one the infection traveled to as well, so he said “oh, then it’s just trauma”. A week into the infection I started getting shooting eye pain in the center of my eye ( about 3/10 on the pain scale if 2/10 was a pinch) in the morning as well as a feeling of pressure behind the eye. However, they checked my eye pressure and they were normal (14&amp;15). I have a feeling of grittiness as well as light sensitivity more predominant in the originally infected eye.

I feel like he is taking my money and trying to make me go for more visits with products that won’t help. He doesn't know what is in my eye but it seems like he wants to go through the entire repertoire of antibiotics before culturing my eye sample to see exactly what I have and how to treat it properly. Do you think I have a fungal eye infection? How long would it take for me to see graying of my eye caused by fungal eye infections?

dn7pyi,Surgical Vision Correction of Myopia with Dry Eye Syndrome,"&amp;#x200B;

I used extended wear soft contacts (-5.5 and -6.0) for many years with no problems up until a few years ago. After a few bouts of GPC, I was diagnosed with Dry Eye Syndrome. It is mild, but I have become completely intolerant to contact lenses. I've tried many 1 day versions with no success - they are just too uncomfortable after even an hour.

I was unable to qualify for Lasik because of ""small areas of cell death"" on my eye that were revealed with that green dye; the surgeon felt this was due to my dry eye and gave me lots of prescriptions to try to improve the condition of my eyes for surgery. My eyes felt pretty good, but after 2 follow-ups he was not comfortable with my progress. At that point, I felt that I clearly was not an ideal candidate, and so became worried about what my outcome my might be, would my dry eyes significantly worsen, etc., so I stopped trying to qualify.

I do not want to be limited to glasses for the rest of my life. Are there any good surgical options out there for me? (Not sure if this matters, but I did have had one instance of an ocular herpes lesion in one eye - treated successfully). Also, I read something maybe a year or 2 ago about a new surgical technique still in the testing phases that didn't involve any corneal cutting at all - any info on the name of this procedure, etc. would be much appreciated.

dnmg3y,Dark blob in peripheral vision,"Hello, I have been having concerns with my eyes for the past few months but lately my symptoms have been getting more concerning.

I went to an optometrist to rule out any sort of retinal issue or other issue that needs to be addressed, and he said my eyes look fine and that the flashes and floaters can be caused by eye strain (I am very far sighted). 

Fast forward a few weeks, and I have developed a dark blob at the very side of the vision in my left eye. It is not present in the vision of my right eye. I can only see it when I blink, and after I blink it lingers for a fraction of a second before disappearing; it basically flashes on and off when I blink. It can best be described as a black blob. I can only see it when I tilt my head at an angle, and it has been there for at least three days, although I kind of think that I remember seeing it as far back as last week.

dnr70r,"After an air freshener got in my eye, wide range of treatments aren't solving the issue","Almost 4 months ago I had the misfortune of having an air freshener go off right in my left eye (didnt touch the right) when I was out in public and I had to leave to find somewhere to flush it out with water which took about 10 minutes until I could, which I did for about 15 minutes. It stung a lot and the next day had dry eye symptoms, something I'm familiar with. I saw an opthamologist the next day who said the usual, try artificial tears and 4 months later with 3 different opthamologists and gone through around 8 different eye drops and nothing seems to help it. As a preface, all 3 opthamologists have done combined I think 7 or 8 eye tests, slit tests etc all the usual stuff and confirm over and over that there's no damage.

The symptoms have gone all over the place but one thing is constant, the upper, inner corner of the eye feels sticky. Every morning I wake up and the left eye is pretty much watering and theres sleep built up while the right eye is clear and theres the persistent feeling of something gritty in my eye and itchyness in that upper corner. There are no other dry eye symptoms, only those two. For the first few months I was given steroid creams to take the inflammation down, then I was given anti-allergens as my eye showed symptoms of allergies (again, the left only). No changes to anything, by now I stopped the artificial tears as they did nothing. My eye started to produce an excess amount of mucus all day long, leading to a period of mucus fishing syndrome where multiple times a day I would find myself removing visibly large amounts from the corner. I was very well aware of how to stop this but the production was way too high.

A second opthamologist identified MGD in the left eye only and said it was actually quite noticeable and appeared to have flared, likely the cause of all this mucus production. so I went to a specialist. I've been doing to warm compresses and had MGD expression with the blephasteam process done along with trying more medicated drops. The excess production is certainly down like 98% of what it was, but nothing appears to be improving with regards to the main symptoms and the itchyness remains. The third opthamologist has explained to me how blocked the glands were when I first saw her and how they are clearing up noticeably so it appears its all getting better but I feel the same. Whether or not there was excess mucus production, I constantly feel like there is something sticky in my eye and every day I wake up its the same story with one dried up and the other perfectly clear.

For what its worth, I am super susceptible to allergies and have OCD which can manifest itself in a form of hypochondria. I'm the sort of person who gets a cut while swimming and my mind instantly focuses on stories of flesh eating bacteria living in water. There's no doubt that the constant itching my eyes isn't helping anything but I never actually touch my eye, just the area around. Sometimes what I do is actually just get my finger a bit cold and press the area between the eye and the nose, since cold touch is really good at stopping itches (I've had eczema, cold is amazing). I've gone through at least 8 different drops to help dry eyes, not a single one of them appears to do anything. Going off the drops also changes nothing.

So yeah, any ideas appreciated. Thanks. I'm aware theres a possibility this could al go away if I just stopped touching my eye for like a week, but sometimes the itch is insane and no drops help.",0,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/dnr70r/after_an_air_freshener_got_in_my_eye_wide_range/"")",2019-10-27 02:40:15,

do6chr,A rare eye problem,"
I am 22 years old and I have a high myopia L-9.5,R-10 along with a cylindrical 2.25 in both eyes. When i was a kid, i was afraid of the doctor, so i did not tell my parents that my eyesight was waning, resulting in me wearing a wrong spectacles of power 2.5 for 8 years, durimg which i feel i have damaged my eyes.I am now wearing the correct spectacles for the past 5 years. I see a multitude of floaters along with black dots, whenever i look at almost anything. In addition to it, my main problem is that, i see millions of black dots, that are moving at a very fast pace in the periphery of the vision. They are closing in as the years have gone by. Apart from it, i am able to see the pukinjees tree sometimes when i open my eyes along with the pressure phosphene that one gets when we press our eyes. One of the pressure phosphenes has blocked a very small part of my peripheral vision. Also, recently, i cannot close my eyes for long as i see millions of flashes, along with the feeling that the flashes are flickering. When i open my eyes, the flickering of image continues for about 20 seconds. I have been to multiple doctors and they claim that everything is fine with my eyes but i feel that my vision is waning as the black pressure phosphenes are enclosing and the millions of tiny dots are also moving towards my central vision. In addition to this, i cannot sleep because of the problem mentioned above.

do8fvf,Seeing bright flashes of light,"Im 14M, I have normal vision 20/20, have never worn glasses before.
  It started last week when I woke up from a nap (in the afternoon), then to be greeted by bright flashes, of white light that were seeming to appear every few minutes before they stopped again. Keep in mind that the room I slept in, when I sleep, I would face the open window. 
  Anyways, I thought it was some kind of eye strain due to my facial muscles near left eye feeling tense and I felt tired to open my eyes. That night, I slept on the living room couch and weirdly I saw the bright flash appear in the room where I first saw them, but weirdly it was shining between the gap of the door. 
  So fast forward to now, I have rested my eyes as much as I could, and I'm still have that weak/tired feeling of opening my eyes, the bright flashes had stopped occuring until today. Now the bright flash I saw happened (at night) in the exact same roomthat I first mentioned and when was not facing the open window, when the bright flash occurred, it seemed to have occurred at the side of my eye, as if it is seen directionally which is so weird. 
  So now I am confused on whether I am actually seeing these bright flashes of light which is caused by an eye problem or the bright flashes are coming from an actual light source. I know that the only light source I have in the room is the led on the ceiling, but the bright flash is coming from the open window.

doj86o,glaucoma help- hydrus stent vs. goniotomy with cataract surgery,"Hello- I'm a neurologist looking for advice on how to manage my dad's advanced glaucoma. He has a hemifield visual field cut from glaucoma in OD, an inferior arcuate defect in his OS. I wish I knew how to attach his visual field pics (HIPAA de-identified of course). He also has cataracts and macular pucker in his OD. He uses his eyes a lot to read, so these issues have become especially bothersome. Also, his IOPs on cosopt and xalatan have been pretty good (about 12-16) so it's not like they are very elevated. I suspect he has normotension glaucoma and my understanding based on my reading is that in these cases, it is good for IOP to be &lt;12. Our local glaucoma specialist recommended a goniotomy procedure (not sure which one, as it seems there are many...based on my own reading, it sounds like Kahook Dual Blade Goniotomy with CS might be a good option). The other glaucoma specialist who is at Wilmer Eye Institute (Hopkins) recommended a Hydrus stent with CS. Now, I am a bit skeptical that the stents will work given his glaucoma is so advanced and they are mostly approved for mild-moderate glaucoma and I suspect they would not lower his IOP enough. However, this glaucoma specialist said he has seen good results. My very basic understanding is that the Hydrus stent with CS may be less effective in the long run but has less risk/adverse effects, whereas the goniotomy has more risks/side effects but is more likely to be effective. Is this understanding correct? He has seen a couple glaucoma specialists and we have gotten mixed advice, so are not sure how to proceed. Of course, by not making any decision, we are making a decision- which is to just let my dad's vision slowly get worse. It would be great to get some other people's input, and maybe even some recs on who to see in the country, though my understanding is that in these cases, it is better to stay local in case he needs follow up? In that case, maybe just sticking with his local glaucoma specialist would be best, since the Hopkins guy is 3 hours away?

dovon3,Peripheral flashes (PVD),"Hi!

I am 23 years old and a month and a half ago I was playing football and was hit hard by a ball right in my right eye. In the minutes after I was hit, half of that eye's vision was just a big gray/black spot which gradually became better. I immediately went to the doctor who did all the examinations and said that the retina was fine, but there was a vitreous hemorrhage which would gradually disappear. I had appointments every week and a half to get my eye checked until after one month after I was hit. In the last appointment everything was fine, and the hemorrhage was disappearing (although there were still traces of it).

However, most of the times when I am somewhere with lots of light I see some peripheral flashes which bother me. I read in the internet that these are caused by PVD, but I could not understand if they will slowly disappear.

Is it likely that the flashes will eventually disappear and that PVD no longer affects me?

I am reaching for ideas here. I have had pain and extreme redness in the outside corner of my left eye for months now. I have been to my Opthamologist multiple times and don't feel any closer to an answer.

My Opthamologist has me using Refresh PluS eyedrops 3-4 times a day, warm compress once per day, prescribed me a steroid ointment for my left eye as well as tried Prolenza which is a non-steroidal eye drop. 

Some of the above seem to help sometimes, but other times not at all. My other eye is prone to dryness and redness, but doesn't exhibit the extreme redness or irritation/pain.

dpupr9,Contact lens confessions,"You know how people lie to their dentists when they're asked whether they floss regularly?  Well, I'm trying to decide whether to be honest with my opthalmologist the next time I go for an eye exam.  I thought I'd test the waters by posting my ""confession"" here anonymously first!

I've been wearing contact lenses for decades; I got my first pair when I was 12.  I started with the non-disposable kind, with the nightly cleanings and weekly protein removal solutions.  I followed instructions pretty closely back then.  

Nowadays I have the disposable kind; I think they're supposed to last 2 weeks per pair, or maybe 4 weeks.  At each eye exam, I get 4 boxes, 6 lenses per box, and I think I'm supposed to call for refills when I run out between annual visits.

The thing is, (I'm so scared putting this out there, even anonymously!) I wear the same pair for months at a time.  I sleep in them.  I never take them out to clean them, because they never get dirty -- except on the rare occasion when I cry for an extended period of time (like during a 2-hour sad movie), in which case I do take them out, scrub them with my Clear Conscience Contact Lens solution (which is probably expired), and then either put them right back in, or experiment with my glasses for the rest of the day (glasses give me a throbbing pain in my temples, but that's a question for another post).

Sometimes when I take them out after a crying spell, I'll throw them away and start a new pair... I'm not \*trying\* to make my supply last forever, I'm just reluctant to throw away a perfectly good pair of lenses if I have the time and energy to scrub and rinse them instead.

So the 4 boxes of 6 lenses each last me 2 or 3 years (maybe longer).  I don't have a regular opthalmologist because I've moved a few times, so I don't get a lot of reminder emails or postcards for annual exams.  I make an appointment for an eye exam when I'm down to my last few pairs.  Each time I do go, my prescription is slightly changed (I'm myopic with astigmatism), although the changes have become smaller as I approach middle age.

I think that perhaps my eyes don't generate as much protein deposits as other peoples' eyes do.  My contacts aren't significantly dry or uncomfortable when I wake up, either, unless I've slept with the ceiling fan on high all night, so I must be pretty good at making tears (which is such an unfortunate homograph in this context!).  The other thing that may be unusual about me is that I've never, to the best of my knowledge and my mother's recollection, had a bacterial infection.  I've had viral infections (colds, flus, chicken pox, canker sores), but I've never had a UTI, ear infection, eye infection, sinus infection, strep throat, food poisoning, or even an infected cut.  I once asked in some medical subreddit whether that is unusual, but I didn't get any replies.

I understand that, as doctors, you might open yourself up to liability if you say ""that's fine; that's normal; keep doing what you're doing.""  I anticipate that, if I get any responses at all, they will be cautionary tales of other neglectful, noncompliant contact lens wearers who tempted fate like this and then contracted some devastating eye disease -- and I would believe you.  I know my lazy contact lens habits are irresponsible and risky; I don't do it on purpose. (I have a pretty severe case of lifelong treatment-resistant depression and inattentive-type ADHD, which limits my personal hygiene and self-care routines to the basics.  But -- ironically -- I do actually floss every night!)

After one week, recovery is going well, although a little bit slower than I thought (eyes a bit dry and sensitive). I still have a decent amount of the drops I was supposed to take for only one week. 

Is there any issue if I keep using them for a couple of days ?

Reasoning is
1) I still have some and probably will not need them (and the pack is open so I cannot just return it)
2) although recovery is going well, I still have minor discomfort which is probably due to my eyes being dry

dqrfzl,Seeking help for GPC,"I’m a female patient and I visited the eye doctor last week (for my yearly exam, but my eyes just happened to start being irritated and itchy). I mentioned to him about my eyes being irritated and he flips my eyelid and says I have small bumps on them caused by my contacts. I’ve been wearing acuvue oasis contacts for years and never had this problem. I’ve been wearing them for a month and never sleep in them. Another thing I forgot to mention to him was I switched to a waterproof mascara around the same time this started. I quickly switched to a kind for sensitive eyes and contacts. So I’m not sure if that has anything to do with it? 

He was pretty vague on what I should do, but he gave me a new contact solution and said if they aren’t better in a month or two then to come back. This is a LONG time to go with feeling like this. He didn’t say to stop wearing them, but I got new glasses and I’ve been three days without putting them in. They still bother me but today hasn’t been TOO bad.. Any recommendations on what I should do? I’ve tried a few different kind of eye drops but none have seemed promising so far. Should I call my doctor and see if he’ll prescribe me some kind of drop? Any advice is greatly appreciated. I’m scared I won’t be able to wear contacts again.",1,1,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/dqrfzl/seeking_help_for_gpc/"")",2019-11-02 15:19:35,
dqsd55,photopsia at young age," 

Male, 15, Asian, 172cm, 49kg. I wear glasses at 2.75 dioptry, one eye is weaker than the other one not sure which one but im guessing its the right eye weaker.

* I have been having Photopsia symptoms. During the day i see floaters on my right eye. (having this symptom for atleast half a year, thought this was normal since everyone saw floaters)
* I used to see floaters on my left eye but i feel like that was 1 or 2 years ago, since then nothing wrong with it. Now for the past month or week i have been seeing flashing lights on my left eye when trying to sleep.
* And this week i felt some eye pain, like 15 second sting in my eyes once or twice per 3 days.

I have done some of my research and it could be retinal detachment which could lead to blindness but i doubt it because im at very young age and never had retinal detachment before. Or it could be migraine aura which im asking if it is possible. And the third option is that it could be just the liquid pulling on the retina.

But im not really sure if im right about my research, i don't speak english very well yet so i am here to ask.

edit: that question sounds should i be worried? is retinal tear or detach common in young people? my eyesight used to be perfectly normal until i started to do a lots of job on computer screens. should i be worried about my vision? could i go blind at this young age?",1,9,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/dqsd55/photopsia_at_young_age/"")",2019-11-02 16:30:37,
dqtewx,Post-LASIK vision still terrible...,"So I posted in an adjacent sub about a year ago and got a few responses, though nothing that really solved my current predicament.  My eyesight unfortunately hasn't improved.  I figured I would post some more info and see if anyone has any additional insight.

Basically, my symptoms are akin to a really bad astigmatism: lonnnng light rays, vertical ghosting of images/text, glowing objects, etc.  I've been told it's probably an ""irregular astigmatism"", however I'm really not getting concrete answers as to what the cause is or how to fix it; I'm told topography is inconclusive.  I've seen multiple docs including cornea specialists, retina specialists, and even a neuro-ophthalmologist.

Some highlights below:

\- 32/M; had LASIK done late 2016.

\- Symptoms are persistent (as in they don't fluctuate) and are present 24/7.

\- Definitely not dry eye (we've ruled this out).

\- Tried RGP lenses and even a specialized PROSE device lens; in all instances my vision seemed to get worse.

\- Visual aberrations seem to change a bit depending on how wide I open my eyes, though still always present (IDK if that means anything).

\- Pinhole test seems to block aberrations but only if it's PRECISELY straight on; a degree off here or there would result in return of symptoms. Coz of this, I use Briminodine every now and again to shrink my iris but it's effects are middling at best.

Do these symptoms sound familiar to anyone? Anyone know what part of the eye could be causing this? Trying to turn over every stone here. I'm sort of at the end of my rope... my quality of life has been steadily deteriorating and I'm not really sure where else to turn. If you need more info, feel free to DM me to discuss.

Recently started getting photophobia have seen two ophthalmologists - used prednerfin forte in my L eye for a few months and have now swapped to flourometholone 2x each eye daily. 
They can not figure out the ‘why?’

OCT scan could not view my left eye due to the silicone oil. They will not operate just to have a ‘look’ :(

The next step will be retrobulbar alcohol injection L eye followed by a possible evisceration.

My question is basically does anyone know if the injection will be beneficial for the photophobia as my L eye is not painful the photophobia is annoying and affecting both eyes.

Or any other tips to help with sudden onset of photophobia? Vision is R eye is 100%.

dsiaz5,Anyone else with PVD have their vision change?,"I got my floaters 2 months ago from a PVD all of a sudden, and they suck but I tell myself that I've gotten used to them by now. What I haven't gotten used to however is the overall change in my vision. It seems like everything has a weird haze or aura around it, and maybe like I have tunnel vision and can only focus on one object at a time. When I look at the ground or something it looks pretty off sometimes,like the lighting is different in each inch of the ground. It almost doesn't look solid, it's hard to explain. What I noticed though is when I cover one eye and look with the other, things seem to look a lot better. I went to an Opthamologist and she told me that its simply because my right eye is weaker than my left, and my glasses don't correct it enough, so there's a blurrier image and a clearer image combining and that's what's giving me the weird haze affect. I'm gonna go back to get a new prescription done, and I hope that new glasses will mostly correct my vision, even if I still have floaters. I've been feeling dissociation, depression, and anxiety since this happened, really because whenever I look around when I'm outside, everything looks fake, like I'm looking at a screen or in a dream.

I've been suffering from Coeliac from a year now and have been experiencing eye flashes in my left eye for about two months. They aren't regular and tend to come at frequent intervals only when I watch TV or a computer screen. I rushed to an ophthalmologist the first instant Inhad one, he checked my retina and said I was alright.

I started getting black floaters in the same eye day before and they just stay when I look in the horizon. The eye feels tired and shit. I went to my eye doctor and he again says there's nothing to worry.

Now he's a professional and everything and he definitely knows better but with the pain, the floater and the flashes--everything in the same eye, I feel there's something off and I cant help but feel that maybe my disease is a connector to my eye issues. I've only had a retina scan done till now, if it matters.

I'd like your opinions on these. Am I missing something here...I mean should I change my doctor (the tests would come just the same) or is there something which needs to be tested or some link everyone is overlooking.

However this time its different. My left ear has been feeling clogged, like there is something inside of it. It doesn't hurt and I can hear fine, but its pretty unsettling. I've made a doctor's appointment and I'll get it checked out on Tuesday.

But I also noticed that my left eye has been blurry. It's not anything severe, I see fine, but I noticed when I close my right eye and look only through my left that there is some blur. Sometimes it can also...tingle..I guess? I can't explain the sensation but I'm not feeling any pain.  Could this be a side effect of my cold? I've never had this before.

Maybe it's nothing but I would like to hear your opinion. If it doesn't go away on its own till Friday, I'll get it checked but I'm interested in your thoughts.

Upon looking closely at my eye in a mirror I noticed a circle around the eye on the white part of the eye. It made me think very strongly that I still had lenses on (which would have been put during the surgery itself as of course I had removed them before the surgery).

Called the surgeon and got the ok to try and remove them after cleaning my hands, and turned out I did indeed have lenses in my eyes for almost three weeks.

Will ask my surgeon on Monday what I should do about drops (start again from scratch or continue with the planned schedule), but what I wanted to ask here is: did having the lens in my eye for 2-3 weeks protect my eye compared to not having one, or could it potentially have harmed my eye / recovery ?

I am a 23 year old male and was diagnosed with this condition around 6 years ago by my Ophthalmologist which I continue to see to this day. 

The condition only appears in my Right Eye. And whenever I start experiencing pain and blurriness I visit my Ophthalmologist which puts me on a treatment of Prednisolone Acetate Eye drops to reduce the inflammation, and I continue to use the eye drops until the cells that form in the eye causing the inflammation clear up.   

Originally I was not concerned with this condition as it would use to flare up once every two years, however the flares have become more frequent, increasing to once per year and now once every few months. 

My Ophthalmologist says there is no known cause of this issue, and there is no permanent treatment to prevent the cells from forming and causing the inflammation. I was also told that the increased frequency of these attacks will have long term consequences such as glaucoma and other possible eye diseases. And unfortunately we can only use treat the current condition with the eye drops and treat any other diseases that may occur in the future as they appear.  

I was hoping there may be an Ophthalmologist on this page that has treated a similar patient and had any successful treatments or any advice to reduce the frequency of attacks.

dvfj6z,Pulsing tunnel vision in one eye,"So this weird thing has been happening occasionally for about a year. The vision in my left eye darkens/fades or sometimes it goes black around the edges like tunnel vision in this pulsing rhythm, so it goes back to normal then darkens, back to normal then darkens etc. A few times, it's been more like the eye goes blurry and kind of weak for a minute then back to normal. It's always over in a few minutes. 

It first happened when I was cycling and I thought maybe it was just because my heart was going fast or something, then I noticed it should happen when I'm focusing hard on something that's small /difficult to see, then more recently I've noticed it happen for apparently no reason at all.

I've also been getting pain on that side of the face recently. It's difficult to pinpoint whether it's coming from the sinus, the eye or my teeth (I'm booking a dentist appointment because my teeth need checking anyway).

dvvvw9,Vertigo and eye pressure but MRI/Balance Test are fine. Corrective lens helps slightly. At a loss.,"Hey all, 

My dad (55)  has been experiencing vertigo for the last 3 months, especially when turning his head or driving/using his peripheral vision. He has met with his GP, an optometrist and and ENT, and he had an MRI and balance test as well as several Epley maneuver treatments, but all tests and blood/eye pressures read normal. 

When he wakes up in the morning, he feels pressure and a bit of weepiness in his right eye, but the vertigo/lightheadedness is fine until about 5-10 minutes of moving around. 

Strangely enough, while his vision wouldn’t normally need correction, a slight corrective lens in his right eye allows him to turn his head without a sense of vertigo. Same if he closes his right eye. The optometrist was shocked and tested multiple times to make sure it wasn’t placebo. That said, he hasn’t been able to try the new glasses much yet because they add to the constant lightheadedness. 

He’s scheduling an appointment with an ophthalmologist next and potentially a neurologist, but it will be awhile before he gets in, and he’s pretty disheartening. I know Reddit can’t diagnose, but I was hoping to shout this into the void in case anyone has dealt with similar cases or has an idea of what we should investigate.

dz1qyu,Can eye exercises help a foggy eye?,"I have some fog and a dark spot (seemingly vitreous) in my left eye. This started about 6 mos ago. I went to the ophthalmologist about 4 weeks ago. (In a diff country and my language skills aren't amazing. Which is why I'm asking here.) They gave me eye exercises to do, and I don't understand the point. Can these exercises really help my symptoms of fog and dark spots? 

Longer story:
They did a round of testing (including a retinal exam.) It looks like there is no retinal detachment, or macular degeneration. I did another round of visual testing (for 40 minutes!) And in the end, the woman gave me a series of exercises to do. This includes (briefly) looking at the tip of a pen near and far, reading at a letter chart close and far, reading something slowly near and far. 

My actual eye sight has not changed. I can still read visual charts near and far with my glasses. But my left eye is just bothersome and foggy. :/

I am supposed to do these exercises three to four times a week for 40 minutes. I've been doing them for two weeks, but I really don't understand the point. Nothing is changing. I read that they best work for lazy eye or cross eye. I've also read that these exercises can help with digital strain, or dry eye, possibly.

But my main concern is the fog and dark spot, which is starting to cause me to squint and affect my vision, making my left eye cloudy. Can these exercises help my current issue? 

A little about me:
* I am middle age female. 
* I have admittedly terrible eyesight. - 12 in left, - 11 in right. It has been stable for about 10 years. 
* Astigmatism in both eyes.
* Dry eye, probably from digital strain. I use muro and eye drops 3x daily. 
* I wear mostly glasses, and a pair of soft daily contacts, about once every 2 weeks. No problems there. 
* My two pairs of glasses are two years old, and 4 years old.

What else can I do?","Hi there, I'm a 33-year-old male and I've lost central vision in my right eye 2 years ago. I've got centrocecal scotoma and I can't read even one letter from the ophthalmic board. My peripheral vision is OK. The loss of vision was quite acute, but a month after it started the loss, became bigger and remains at this level till now. It happened during a very stressful period of my life.I  used to have 2 similar episodes in the past, 7 years ago and 3 years ago, which the first one lasted for 1 month, second for 7 months and afterward I had a spontaneous recovery and my vision went back to perfect. Anyway, the vision loss back then was less significant than it is now. During these episodes, I observed that my vision got worse during exercises/ heat. 

Here's the summary of various tests I've had since the vision loss has started:

**• Vision field test: Right eye - Outside normal limits, centrocecal scotoma; Left eye - OK**  
**• Cerebrospinal fluid: oligoclonal bands type II have been found**  
**• Visual evoked potentials: right eye - bad, there's a delay; left eye - borderline/OK**

• Leber's neuropathy: negative  
• Basic optical examination: OK, discs of both eyes are normal, everything looks normal  
• Colors vision: OK, normal in general, but with the sick eye I see blue colors as more vivid  
• Fluorescein Angiography: OK  
• Optical Coherent Tomography (Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov): OK, same results even compared with 2016.  
• Brain MRI: no demyelination, OK (results from 2016 and now)  
• Eyes MRI (nerves and sockets): no demyelination, OK  
• Spine MRI: no demyelination, OK  
• Solu-Medrol i.v. for 5 days: no answer to treatment, no recovery at all  
• Lime disease: negative  
• Toxoplasma: negative  
• Doppler USG of neck arteries: OK  
• TSH, Cholesterol, glucose in blood, blood morphology, urine: OK  
• Neurological examination: OK  
• B12, Folic acid levels: OK  
• EKG: OKHere's the list of meds I've taken during the treatment:• Dexamethason  
• Solu-medrol (3x i.v.)  
• B Vitamins  
• Sertraline  
• Brintellix (Vortioxetine)  
• Pregabaline

The neurologists and ophthalmologists that I've consulted have said that they have no further idea on the treatment so they send me to the psychiatrist. I was obsessed with this disorder, read about the symptoms on the Internet a lot and couldn't sleep, which led me to anxiety and depression.  
The psychiatrist has diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder but after two years of treatment with  Sertraline, Vortioxetine, and Pregabaline no effect on the eye. I just worry less about this, haven't accepted it yet, though.

e073b0,I only have depth perception when wearing sunglasses??,"Hello, I have this weird thing I've wondered about for a few years and I was wondering if this was something that happened for everyone or if I was just weird?

When I wear sunglasses (or I think anything with polarized lenses), the world looks more 3D. 

An example: I was standing at the bus stop earlier today and I noticed that some clouds looked all seperated from one another. If I took the sunglasses off (14$ Walmart glasses), I could still tell which cloud was closer by where they overlapped, but they all look on the same plane, like a photograph. But with the glasses on, they looked seperated from each other by another element. Depth, I guess. 

Like I said this isn't the first time I've noticed the sunglasses make things look 3D, but I've never heard anyone else talk about it.

What could the cause be?","I’m not sure how urgent this is because my vision is totally fine now. I’m going to see my optometrist in a few weeks to get my eyes checked out. I will definitely go to Urgent Care if I experience this eye sight issue again.

For the last six months, I’ve noticed that the vision in my right eye is slightly dimmer than in my left eye. I’ve also noticed that my night vision has been noticeably worse in both eyes for the last six months. I had an eye checkup around that time, but I forgot to mention these issues to my doctor. The eye checkup went fine. During these last six months, I regularly watched TV in a dark room while lying on my left side in bed for hours at a time each night. I feared that watching TV in a dark room was causing my issues, so I stopped doing that for a month or two. My vision was totally fine during the last few months.

But last night, I did it again. I was lying on my left side in bed watching shows on my iPad for only 15 minutes. I was using f.lux and didn’t have any lights on in the room. Everything was fine until I turned off my iPad (which was the last source of light in the room). 

Suddenly, my view went pitch black on my right side. I could see stuff in the darkness with my left eye just fine, but my right eye was completely useless. I turned on my light and realized that I had gone color-blind in my right eye. The color-blindness in my right eye persisted for 5-10 minutes. Then, my eye sight went back to normal.

For the last few hours, my eye sight has been totally normal, though I might have a few more floaters than normal (in both eyes). Something extra odd about this: A few hours after this happened, my night vision seemed to dramatically improve in both eyes.

I’m 99% sure that looking at a screen in a dark room is the activity that is causing this, so I’m not going to do that anymore. I'll be seeing my optometrist in a few weeks and I will go to Urgent Care if this eye sight problem happens again. I’m just not sure if this is indicative of an emergency.

How serious is this? Which type of health issues could be responsible for temporary blindness and temporary color-blindness in one eye? My eye sight is fine now, so should I wait a few weeks to see my optometrist?

e0xjur,Question regarding the nature of a healthy peripheral vision,"Hi! 

So, a few months ago my eye doc said that I might have glaucoma because of a large optic nerve cupping. I did all the usual tests, they all came back pretty good (a few borderline spots in my OCT) but he said that we'll have to check again for a few months before having a meaningful result. 

Needless to say, I'm basically scared shitless since then and always double check my visual field and whatnot. 

Now today at my girlfriends apartment I noticed something. There are lots of leftover ""drill holes"" in her bedroom walls and I noticed that when I don't look directly at them, some of them disappear in my peripheral vision. So what I'm asking is..

.. is it normal for your eyes to tune out some things in your peripheral vision or should I be worried about progressing vision loss? Note: The drill holes were near a window where light was shining through it, that's why I'm wondering if they might have gotten ""tuned out"" of my vision because of the difference in light.

* Squinting improves the double vision / ghosting quite a bit.
* The double vision is worst when looking at a high-contrast background (eg as above, white text on black background).

e2thbn,Normal saline for RGP rinsing?,"Posted this a few hours ago in r/keratoconus, but didn't quite get an answer.

I was diagnosed with keratoconus a couple of months ago, and fitted for the first time in my life with contacts (RGPs as stated above). They told me to buy a cleaning kit consisting of a conditioner, a soapy white liquid with a red cap described as ""cleaner"" (both if those in a single box labeled ""gp system"", from Avizor) and a big bottle of multipurpose cleaning solution.

Off I went with a sharper vision than I had in the last 7-10 years. I still see some halos at night, and I'll address that next time I go, but it's a huge improvement.

Anyway, they gave me the following cleaning regime after taking out the contacts at night:  
-Rinse cleaning case with the multipurpose solution.  
-Put a drop or two of the cleaning liquid on each lens.  
-Rub firmly but gently each lens for about half a minute.  
-Rinse with the multipurpose solution until it runs clear and all the ""soap"" has washed away.  
-Store in conditioner.

After doing a bit of research (couldn't quite find what I was looking for) I was left wondering: can I use sterile normal saline solution for rinsing that soap? I went through my bottle of multipurpose (350 ml, costing about $180 MXN) in like 20 days and it really feels wasteful, even more so considering that the saline is almost 8X cheaper.  
I know normal saline doesn't have the antiseptic properties of the multipurpose, but I don't see why I can't rinse the soap with that if I'm still storing my lenses in the conditioner, which seems to have about the same ingredients as the MP. I don't have any issue in using MP for the last couple of rinses if needed, it's just that rinsing them from the beginning until no soap is left really uses up a lot.

I tried asking about this at the hospital, but I was told some BS sounding stuff among the lines of ""you can't do that because the saline will form mineral deposits"". Tried to argue that the multipurpose was &gt;99% saline, just with a bit more added stuff, but they weren't listening.

I'm 26, female, take Humira and lotemax (I think that's the name) and Xiidra. 

In June I got diagnosed with Uveitis from my Opthalmologists. I had been struggling with eye pain and other random symptoms for a few months when they caught it. Both eyes, anterior Uveitis. My eye doctor gave me all kinds of drops and eventually I saw a Rheumatologist who started Humira. 

Fast forward to now, and the Humira helped the Uveitis but I developed ear pain that an ENT hasn't figured out yet. Three weeks ago I started having major sinus issues and ended up back of predinsone and antibiotics so I can't take my Humira. 

Tonight I laid down for bed and the second I closed my eyes I saw really bright flashing lights, kind of like strobe lights. They were intense enough to be uncomfortable so I turned the light on and although they persisted for a few minutes they went away. Lay back down, flashing lights start again. I am also seeing weird blobs of color moving around. The lights are in both my eyes and in the peripherals mostly. 

Curious- is this an issue I need to have looked at? Tomorrow is Thanksgiving and I'm going out of town.

e3f087,"Greetings! I have had this terrifying symptom (worsening) for a couple of years. I've been to a couple Opthalmologist, and now I have a new symptom- and an example of what it looks like. (No answers so far) Would love to have some ideas or insight before I go to my next appointment next week.","Symptom #1.  So for a couple of years now (maybe four) I have had intermittent-or pulsing - ""missing"" vision in both eyes in my central vision.  If I have both eyes open, one or the other always compensates for the lack of vision in the other and so I really only notice the anomaly if I have one eye closed, or am searching detail on a 3D object.  I have had visual field tests.  The eye always ""wakes"" for the stimulation of light.  In fact, I could be gazing at a lamp, and everything around the lamp goes dark.  But!  If I stir the eye, everything comes back into view.  This is always happening.  Not a migraine.

Symptom #2 (new symptom). I am going to see a new Opthalmologist (I just moved to this area). This issue started a couple of months ago.  I only notice it when fixing my gaze on a blank lit wall, while in a dark room (so staring into the hallway from my bed) and more importantly, while watching TV.  I notice it frequently while watching TV, but NOT while using my phone or computer screen. So, distance only.

[Here is a flawless example](https://gfycat.com/silverglumdingo) of what it looks like when it happens (and unless I really try to fix my gaze to search, I notice it intermittently, but with frequency). The dots in the poor quality gif- it looks just like that.  And they ""move"" along with the image I'm watching. And then I stop noticing it or it goes away.  It happens so suddenly and each time it startles me, and is giving me anxiety.

I have dry eyes, for which I take eye drops.  But I've also noticed that when I wake up, I see a photo negative type image of a honeycomb pattern (actually weirdly uniform pattern), and the lines are shimmering, and the inner parts look almost like warping in space or something.  I can't put my finger on how, but the honey comb seems related to both dry eye as well as the weird dots issue.  This goes away after I've fully woken up usually after 4 mins or so.

e4n24u,Vitreous detachment took some of my macula with it.,"In mid November I started to see a circular flash in my left eye and an area right in my central vision was obscured. It reminded me of the first part of a migraine where my central vision is interrupted. A visit to my optometrist produced the diagnosis of the vitreous in the midst of detaching and a large floater right in the middle of my vision. She said it likely that a small piece of my macular was pulled off and that is what I’m seeing. She said to give it a couple of weeks and I won’t see it anymore, my brain will account for it. However this is not happening. I find it hard to read (books, road signs, emails) and is affecting my job and home life.

e4sknu,Recurrent dry spot on edge of iris?,"Hey! So I have this spot on the edge of my iris thats been feeling super dry for like a week. Here’s the story:

Two months ago, I either irritated my eyes by getting waterproof mascara in them (sometimes I miss and poke my eye/contact), or the smoke from a bonfire that night irritated the shit out of them. Had red eyes for 4 days. Then normal.

Occasionally since then, one eye will get inflamed in the same way but to a lesser extent. Two different tubes of mascara, both new/newer, one waterproof one not. I’ve switched contacts at least once in this time, and rinsed and let my contact case dry out in between contact sets.

Now, there’s a spot on my eye that’s just not feeling right. It’s about 1-2 mm wide, maybe 2-4 mm tall, and is right where the redness always seems to start—in line with the pupil but on the nose-side of the iris, right at the border. It constantly feels dry there, and I can’t wear contacts for more than a few hours without it bothering me. I’ve been wearing my glasses for the better part of a week now, with only mild improvement. Have been using some lubricating eye drops, not sure it’s helping.

Any clue as to what’s going on? It’s not painful, just confusing. And ideally I’d like to be able to wear my contacts again, lol!

e55lc3,360 Laser Cerclage,"Hello. I've posted here for advice before and was respectfully looking to gather some opinions on a medical procedure that has been recommended to me. I posted this earlier today in the optometry subreddit and wanted to do so here as well.

I am a highly myopic (OD: -12.00, -3.25 | OS: -9,-3.5) male in my late 20s. High myopia runs in my family but there have been no cases of true vision impairment that I am aware of. About a year ago, after my first ever dilated exam I was diagnosed with asymptomatic lattice degeneration. At the time, it was recommended that this condition simply be observed and that no further action be taken. I had my last exam at the same facility but with a different doctor, who recommended that I undergo 360 Laser Cerclage even though my condition hadn't changed since the last time I was in. I tentatively agreed and my pre-op screening is on Friday. I was hoping that I could ask you folks a few questions so that I have a basis for comparison when I ask my doctors the same thing later this week. My questions are as follows:

1. How much does this procedure actually reduce my risk for experiencing an RD? Enough so that one might say that I *need* to have it?
2. The form I was given states that some risks this surgery poses include RD, cataract, inflammation, decreased vision, and the need for additional surgeries. How commonly do these addition risks occur?
3. I already struggle with floaters. Will this procedure create more?
4. Some doctors believe that prophylactically treating lattice degeneration makes no difference in high myopes. In your experience, is this true?

Any insight members of this community can give me regarding this procedure would be very much appreciated. I've never had to undergo any kind of medical procedure to speak of so this is a little nerve-racking for me.

e5iwh1,Question about Symptoms of Healing Eye Scratch,"I managed to get jabbed in my right eye with a finger last Friday evening. Saturday, my eye would water and hurt intermittently, but I could otherwise see fine out of it. Same story Sunday. I had a late flight into LA Sunday night, and woke up in my hotel Monday morning and the vision in my right eye was blurry and wouldn't clear up.  


I went to urgent care, they dyed my eye and confirmed there is a scratch on the top of the eye (not the cornea I believe) and gave me antibiotic drops and recommended sleep to keep the eye closed. I slept most of the day yesterday and it seemed like the blurriness was SLIGHTLY better before bed last night. But I woke up again with blurred vision as bad as yesterday morning.  


I'm sure I just need to keep taking the drops (I'm also taking ibuprofen), but **I'm primarily looking for an explanation of why my vision went blurry 2.5 days AFTER the injury? Does swelling during the healing process cause blurred vision that maybe didn't happen during the first couple of days?**  


I'm mostly trying not to freak out, and also wondering how long I should give it to heal before being concerned enough to go to an eye specialist.

e5mbpp,Ophthalmologist is stumped,"I have an appointment next week to see a retina specialist, but I thought it couldn't hurt to see if anyone had any idea what could be wrong with me. I've seen my ophthalmologist four times over the last month, plus getting a second opinion from another ophthalmologist.

I'm 33, and about a month ago I had a dark spot appear in my vision in my left eye. I was examined by my ophthalmologist, and he said he saw one small hemorrhage in each eye (it was far into my peripheral vision in my right eye). He originally suspected diabetes or high blood pressure, but some tests from my primary doctor ruled those out. The hemorrhages showed up immediately after being upside down for a little while, so he suspected it may have been the result of increased pressure in my eyes from that. The blood tests showed high cholesterol and some slightly elevated markers for inflammation (positive ANA, C-reactive protein 0.6, sed rate 25). I have a skin condition called hidradenitis suppurativa that could be responsible for these, though.

The next week, I saw another dark spot appear in my vision in the left eye, but it was different this time. It was more like the spot that appears when you look at a bright light and then look away. It was intense, but only lasted for about 20 seconds. I was just sitting on the couch reading at the time, not looking at anything bright. On exam, my ophthalmologist didn't see anything abnormal. I've experienced these spots a few more times since then, usually when I'm at rest, but they always resolve very quickly.

The week after THAT, I noticed that I had a new floater in my left eye and a bunch of new floaters in my right eye. I had ANOTHER exam, and he wasn't even able to see any floaters. He didn't see a PVD or anything else abnormal, just said that my hemorrhages were healing up well. The week after this I got a second opinion, and he didn't see anything either.

Last night, I had what I thought was another hemorrhage appear in my left eye. It was smaller than the original hemorrhage. It started off as a small, very distinct spot that was slightly oblong. After about 10-15 minutes, the borders had spread out irregularly and it had grown a little bit. After an hour, it had grown a little more and become less distinct with fuzzy borders. When I woke up the next morning, I couldn't see it anymore. I saw my ophthalmologist today, and he didn't see any sign of another hemorrhage. Again, he said that my eyes looked perfect - the hemorrhage in my left eye was mostly healed, and the one one in the right eye was completely gone.

He said he doesn't really know what's going on. He referred me to a retina specialist, and he wants my primary doctor to send me for a carotid doppler, even though the symptoms don't really seem to match an arterial blockage. I don't really seem to have other symptoms - no flashes, no blurred vision, etc. Does anyone have any ideas on what could be going on?",1,7,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/e5mbpp/ophthalmologist_is_stumped/"")",2019-12-03 11:37:44,
e5pl6j,Sudden double vision,"Last weekend I left my house around noon to run some errands, and was overwhelmed by an onset of double vision when I tried to focus on objects down the street. Things at room distance appear less doubled, so I may have been seeing double since waking up in the morning, and not noticed it until I left my apartment to go outside. My distance vision is still double almost a week later.

Some background is that I've been working on a computer project almost non-stop, 10 hours a day, for the last month. I am in my 40s and don't wear glasses, though I have a very mild old age reading prescription. Very recent blood tests indicate that I don't have diabetes, am negative for thyroid problems, and all my other readings are normal except for slightly elevated uric acid, which has sometimes caused inflammation in my history.

I went to an optometrist who took six photos of the inside of my eye and did not see anything unusual. He suggested some eye exercises which have been helping a little, but I still have double vision and I'm growing concerned that there is something else wrong which is much more severe than old age vision issues. I'm trying to determine *why* I am suddenly seeing double, to make sure it's not a part of a bigger problem, and I'm not sure if I should see an ophthalmologist.

My question is: could it be possible that I've always has unaligned eyes since childhood and have been able to compensate for it until now, and that my eye muscles have ""given out"" on aligning them properly? Could eye strain be responsible for causing the double vision, and can it resolve itself over time? Finally, how indicative is this of a tumour outside the eye pushing down? There was no evidence of a tumour in the optometrist's photographs but maybe it's outside the eye, between the frontal lobe and the eyeball? When should I be concerned about this, if at all?",1,9,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/e5pl6j/sudden_double_vision/"")",2019-12-03 15:13:57,

e63ip7,Weird blurry spot in top left corner of eye?,"A few months ago I noticed a weird blurred spot in the upper corner of my left eye.  At first I thought it was a random floater and didn't pay much attention to it.  A day later it got bigger and I got worried.  I made an appointment with my eye doctor and she dilated and checked everything and said everything looked good, my eyes were in perfect health other than being super nearsighted.  She did mention that it seems like my eye might be having troubles focusing and mentioned something about the gel in my eye that might be causing the issue.  She said originally she was worried my retina was detaching but after checking it, she said it was fine.

I had been to the eye doctor about a month before for my annual checkup and the vision in my left eye was -6.25.  When I went in for the first appointment for the blurry spot she told me my vision was -6.5, not too worrying.  The next day I went in for a peripheral test and there were no issues, and after another exam with another doctor my eyesight in the left eye was -7.5.  Two days later the spot was getting worse and I went back in and the Dr. rechecked everything and my eyes still did not have anything wrong with them but my eyesight had advanced to -8.5 in the left eye.  She suggested readers for work while on the computer, roughly 8 hours a day.  She did not seemed concerned that my vision in the left eye had gone from -6.5 to -8.5 within a few days.  She sent me to an ophthalmologist specialist who did a bunch of test, and looked extensively in my eye and found no issues and told me to come back if the issue got worse.  At this point the spot or vision was not getting any worse, so I decided to live with it.  I think my brain kind of tuned the spot out after a while.  

Recently, in the last two weeks, the spot has returned.  I can see it again and its about the same as it was before and at this point after 3 doctors looking in my eyes and not finding anything I have lost some faith that this can ever be resolved.  Its an annoying spot and does interfere with my daily life.  Some days its worse than others and some days I feel like I am sensitive to bright lights, when I never have been before.  Its kind of like everything gets aura-y.

I think I have given as much info as I can about what has happened.  Does anyone know what might be going on?  I'm tired of being told everything is fine, when I can see that there is definitely something wrong and never had an issue like this before.",1,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/e63ip7/weird_blurry_spot_in_top_left_corner_of_eye/"")",2019-12-04 10:32:41,
e6553i,Retinoschisis and Intraocular Pressure,"TL;DR:

* Is intraocular pressure a symptom of retinoschisis?
* Is retinoschisis related to any autoimmune diseases?
* Is there any correlation between problems in different eyes?

Background:

* 2009 - First diagnosis of iritis in the left eye. Treated with Prednisolone Acetate drops. Had many blood tests done to check for autoimmune issues due to frequent recurrence. Tests came back negative.
* 2010 - First diagnosis of macular edema in the left eye. Treated with intravitreal injection.
* 2011-2018 - Iritis in left eye flares up every few months to varying degrees. Drops are always on hand. 
* 2019 - Flare ups in the left eye start occurring more often. Discussed with doc that whenever I stop treatments for sinus issues, the problem comes right back, just like the iritis. Treatment is extended to several weeks to taper off the Prednisolone more gently. This is effective.
* October 2019 - Diagnosed with macular edema in the left eye. Treated with Ketorolac drops. Rheumatologist had new bloodwork done to check for autoimmune issues again. Only positive result is for presence of inflammation. Too generic to make any determinations.
* November 2019 - Diagnosed with retinoschisis in the right eye. Severe pain in sacroiliac joint made me unable to walk for about a week.
* December 2019 - Feels like there is increased intraoccular pressure in the right eye. Doc says macular edema is improving, but vision is still blurry. Seeing doc next week.
* As long as I can remember, I've had sinus problems and intermittent discomfort in the sacroiliac joint. This may or may not be relevant. Just mentioning it because docs have looked into autoimmune issues.

e6cqcr,"Can you choose which eye you ""look"" out of?

Not only can I choose which eye I look out of, I do not look out of both eyes unless I make myself (then I have double vision).

e6urwk,Do I need Lipiflow? How bad are my Meibomian glands?,"I originally posted this in r/optometry but I'm looking for as many opinions as possible so posting here too.

In November, I went for a regular eye checkup to the optometrist I've been seeing for the last decade or so. Usually, I trust her judgement in everything, but her practice was bought by a franchise and has become noticeably more commercialized since then. This time when I visited, she took a photo of my meibomian glands (second photo) and told me that because I was not blinking/staring at screens for too long, about 30-50% of my glands were atrophying or dead. I've never done this test before, so I don't know how much of this atrophy has occurred in recent years. I was also surprised about the severity - aside from occasionally watery eyes, I haven't noticed any symptoms of dry eyes (no grittiness, pain, etc). She said that the only way to save the rest of the glands was through Lipiflow - a $1200 treatment, not covered by insurance. She also said that it wouldn't be a long term fix, and that I'd have to do it once every five years. I'm 20 years old and a full time student, so this was not good news for me.

She booked me for a dry eye evaluation, and in the interim, she sold me a gel eye mask and told me to do hot compresses for 20 minutes a day, which I've been doing religiously. This week I had my dry eye evaluation, and the first thing I noticed in the waiting room was how \*every single patient\* who was leaving had purchased a gel eye mask. I'm aware that dry eyes is becoming more prevalent, but that was a bit of a red flag to me. Other red flags I've encountered are I spoke to my general physician, who had never heard of Lipiflow (although he's old and I believe Lipiflow is newer in Canada than the US), and several of my aunts, uncles, and cousins (Canadians and Americans alike) who are doctors have also never heard of Lipiflow before. One uncle who had heard of MGD told me the compresses were enough to fix the problem. The final red flag, however, is that my optometrist told me that this issue was \*very severe\*, but outright refused to refer me to an ophthalmologist, and then hesitated when I asked for a copy of the report, including photos. She did let me take a photo of one of my eyes, which I'm now posting to ask you: Am I being scammed?

I've done enough reading to know that Lipiflow is safe and does benefit several patients, but I need to know if **my** situation is severe enough to merit spending that kind of money. I can definitely see that my glands don't look right, but are there other ways to fix them? I don't want to regret doing nothing years from now. I do want to disclose that I was on Accutane between 2016-2017, and I've been on birth control (Tricyclen) for the last two years to manage menstrual pain/heavy bleeding. She knows I'm on birth control and she knew when I was on Accutane, but she never mentioned them in relation to this issue.

e73pxy,Question regarding visual flashes.,"Hello all, 

I \[29 M Caucasian\], otherwise healthy with no medical history, am having some visual distrubances : 

I have a history of optical migraines that began in January of 2017. Since then I've only had about 6 and I usually only get a slight headache afterwards, nothing severe. 

Recently (in about the last 7-9 months) I've been experiencing visual flashes in my left visual field (in both eyes, I believe). The flash occurs for around 500 milliseconds and appears to be about the size of a pinhead (the super tiny ballpoint pins). I've noticed a correlation between the occurrence of these flashes and A) stress, B) sleep deprivation, and C) high caffeine intake. I recently finished my applications to neuroscience Ph.D. programs, so all of these factors have been present. 

I went to the ophthalmologist today and he said that my retinas and optic nerves both appear to be healthy. He also said that he doesn't suggest further tests based on his observations. I told him that I am slightly worried as my mother's diagnosis of multiple sclerosis had been preceded by an episode of optic neuritis years prior. I questioned if the visual flashes that I am experiencing could be due to demyelination in my optic nerve(s) and/or a developing lesion in my visual cortex. He stated that he doesn't believe this to be the case, but wrote me a referral for an MRI to provide peace of mind. 

I was hoping some of you could offer your opinions/suggestions on this?

I also have always needed my phone at 100% brightness. I saw 4 eye doctors between January and October, including 2 retinal specialists ( one of the top ones in the nation btw). I had scans done of eyes and the doctors said everything was perfectly fine. No signs of anything.

Initially he thought it might be the cornea healing and was surprised in the 1 week post op when it didn't go away. My left eye was clear and good about 2-3 days post-op, then the 4th day started having the ghosting issues, where the faint double image appears to the right and disappears if I look at a bright light. My right eye has had it the entire 6 weeks, and the ghost image is stronger and appears to the left, it also sticks around if I look at bright lights. During the day, outside, where it's evenly bright out I can see clearly, but the dimmer the lighting, the worse it gets. So my pupils dilating must have something to do with it.

The other thing is that my pupils are not centered. My left one is almost on center but a tad bit closer to my nose. Righty is noticably closer to my nose. The doc doesn't seem too concerned about this though but I'm wondering what's causing it.

Would the ghosting be a result of the pupils being off center or astigmatism or some other reason?

- he sees them all the time (not just when looking into bright light) but they’ve recently gotten worse. 
- they move around and are different sizes. Sometimes they’re big enough to cover his entire field of vision. He can see through them. 
- his vision isn’t blurry when it’s just the colored spots but...
-...when the spots fade they fade to black or gray and he can’t see through that. The “blind spots” last up to a few seconds. He said they’re varying darkness (gray to black) and the darker the spot the longer it lingers 
- he sees them in both eyes but seems to be seeing more in the eye that hurts 
- he’s reported eye pain in the last 12 hours or so. Not excruciating but enough to bother him. The eye and eye socket hurt, especially when touched. 
- no headaches or vomiting 
- no big injuries recently - though he did hit his head hard at school a few times in the last couple of weeks (per the school nurse)

I’m not super worried but just wish I had an explanation. I went to an optician and he said the double vision wasn’t “true” as it’s more of a ghosting than anything else. I got checked at the doctors anyway this time last year and he said it’s probably nothing to worry about.
But neither of them gave me any explanation. 
I have it when I close either eyes, and ive been diagnosed with mild astigmatism in both eyes. I’ve had that since I was a kid but I never used to wear my glasses.

At August 2019, I feel something weird in my vision field. Something like 'shadow' blinking at ther cornor bottom of my eyes, at least 1 second everytime I close my eye, wait for a moment, and 're-open' it. I tell my doctor, she check my eyes with a device that looks like head-flashlight-device after dilated my pupil. And She said nothing wrong with my eye nerve and retina.

At September/October 2019, there's a new 'variant'. Something that looks like 'blinking water vapor' appear every morning (and sometimes at afternoon). It happen more than 1 seconds. It wont fade away even I close my eyes. Then my doctor check with OCT for macula, and there's nothing wrong. All graph are green, which mean it's good. She said it happen because of my 'Medium Myopia' that cause my retina attracted. But she confirmed that's not a problem at all.

But as 'paranoid person'. I feel scared every morning, everyday because of these blink(s). Anyone here have a problem like me?

I saw an optometrist recently, got retinal imaging, dilated eye exam, everything checked out. ""Your retina looks good, macula looks great"".

I'm a 27-year-old male.

I had LASIK surgery for near-sightedness about 5 months ago, and my vision seemed to have stabilised quite well after the first month but I'm noticing that now, 5 months later, I'm experiencing a few issues that concern me.

Firstly, my right eye seems to see things that are far away with much more clarity than my left eye. With things that are closer, my left eye seems to see things with more clarity than my right. I'm not so sure about the latter, but very sure about the former (very noticeable, but not extremely severe). 

Before the operation, my eyes had different prescriptions also, though I can't remember if they matched what I'm experiencing now.

I do plan to see my ophthalmologist for a control session soon, but I'm planning to travel at the end of the week (for a week), so won't be able to book an appointment right away.

Being totally honest, I use the computer a lot. I work 7hrs a day in front of the laptop, then I sometimes play video games or edit videos for many hours after. I know that's a bad habit and I should take breaks. I try where I can. Also, I'm going to look for some blue light glasses.

eap8e9,Do I have eye flashes?,"I (28 M) have been having eye floaters for the last 3 months. There seems to be half a dozen of them in my left eye and two of them in my right eye. I had never experienced floaters before, I didn't even know that it existed. Anyway, I've never had to wear glasses and I have a very good sight.

I've already seen an ophtalmologist and scheduled all the exams that she asked me to do. As I began reading about it on the internet, I also found out about eye flashes and at first I thought I didn't have those, I thought I only had floaters. But now I'm a little paranoid about also having flashes. It's just that I'm not sure wether what I'm experiencing is really eye flashes. Let me describe it.

Most of my floaters are on my left eye. Whenever I turn my head or my eyes swiftly from left to right, one of the floaters of my left eye seems to get bright, it seems to become a bright spot, and then the brightness disappears after a second.

It's important to note that it only happens when I'm at a bright room. It never happens when I'm in a dark room. Anyway, it ALWAYS happens whenever I turn my head of my eyes very swiftly from left to right in a bright room (especially looking at a white wall).

Can it be considered an eye flash?",1,1,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/eap8e9/do_i_have_eye_flashes/"")",2019-12-14 12:57:26,
eaqt5f,Bubble/ Bump on eyeball,"Just looking for advice for what to do and what Dr to see.

I have a bump that comes up on my left eye, in the same spot. It comes and goes. It is on the white part of my eyeball closest to my ear. 
I will have it a most days usually in the morning then it goes away for the day. Then the next morning it is back. Sometimes it gives me a few days off. Then I wake up one morning and it's back.  (It also comes during the day sometimes but usually the morning is a reoccurring thing)

It started in September for a week. Went to my general practitioner she said it was a sty (but I thought those could only be on the lid not the eye ball) so no intervention except for saline eye drops. It went away after a week. 

It stayed away until almost a month later in October. I have been to a ear,eye,nose and throat specialist twice. Neither time I went it was active when I had my appointment. So they said maybe it's an allergy to ragweed, gave me steroid eye drops for a week and told me it should go away.  Ragweed season is done in my area but the bump persists. The eye Dr also told me to use alaway eye drops. They do nothing for the bump itself but if my eye is itchy and I use them it helps that. 

It has been coming and going ever since. It hurts really bad when it is active, and is very irritating. 
It feels like something is in my eye, it burns and when it gets really bad sometimes my eyelids burn. (There is no physical change except the bump on my eyeball getting bigger, smaller or going away) 


[Bump on eyeball](https://ibb.co/61zDRqC)
I have more pictures if it would help. 

Update: I got put on methylprednisolone for a week for carpal tunnel and it completely went away for 8 days. Which is the longest it has not bothered me. 
Out of the past 58 days I haven't had the bump come up for 15 days. :( :( 


Any idea of what it could be? Any idea of anything I can take to make it go away or stay away? Any ideas would be helpful or what kind of Dr I should go see next? Again I am desperate and lost of what I should do about this.

Acuvue incredibly blurry, Air Optix completely clear... Why is this, what happened to cause this change?","Prescription (Biofinity Toric)

L +3.00 -.75 AX150

R +4.00 -1.25 AX030

BC 8.7 DIA 14.5

The only difference is that the Air Optix and Acuvue are both AX160/AX020 instead of 150/030 (didn't even notice this until writing this post, but the Acuvue are blurry with these too). Would this make a large difference? It felt like my eyes could never relax and clear. Always slightly out of focus which would cause fluctuation issues and accomodation struggles. Tried dry eye treatments (xiidra, omega 3 refresh drops 4x daily, added in Systane Ultra, warm compress mask, bought a vicks warm mist humidifier, duct plugs), nothing helps. Vision clearer without contacts than with contacts. Been driving me insane and honestly ruining my life to an extent, since it's been hard to handle the blur. But now after a year of back and forth (only get seen once a month), this Air Optix seems good? And I have a fresh pair of the Biofinity Torics in front of me too, and same issue, so it's very apparent the difference between two brand new lenses. Even switching back and forth, immediately, is obvious.

Why is this? I wore Biofinity Toric from 2011-2015 and then started having these issues with out of focusness / blurriness. Switched to glasses for awhile, but broke mine after a few years and have been trying contacts again as it helps me much more than glasses due to being amblyopic (right eye, not left which is the problem in this post) and glasses making me dizzy due to that / my prescription in general (?).

Additionally, I was told with my astigmatism, I cannot do scelerl / RGP lenses / hard lenses? Is that true? My major issue is that all light (especially blue lights, like on a router or christmas lights) has a double on top and behind it. I've been told this is irregular astigmatism, but I've also been told I am not a candidate for hard lenses due to dryness / astigmatism? Isn't that... what hard lenses are for?

ebun4v,PVD symptom still going after several years?,"Around 3 years ago, I saw a ""flash"" in my left eye. This was on the right side of my left-eye's field of vision, about half-a-centimetre to the right from the centre of the Amsler Grid and, and maybe 1/4 of a centimetre down.

When this calmed down a bit, it became a bit like a camera flash after-image which didn't go away, so I went to Specsavers and was referred to the eye unit at a nearby hospital.

They performed the full range of scans; a visual field test, something which involved laser-scanning my retina, simply looking at the problem with my eyes dilated...

As I was in my mid-30s, the doctor was really trying to convince me this problem was a floater, but I was pretty sure it wasn't as the problem was ""fixed"" (it moved in perfect tandem with the movement of my eye, no drift). Still, the nature of the tests they did meant they strongly believed I hadn't suffered a retinal tear or detatchment.

After much examination, the doctor said they believed I was suffering from a mild form of PVD, and that I should keep aware of it and only come back if the problem got worse. They said I should avoid anything which would ""jar"" my head for a few months, so stuff like intense exercise or rollercoasters and the like, but that I should expect this as I got older, and it *should* get better over time (though could take months).

It's now maybe 2 years later, and I can still see the mark in my eye. It's definitely less noticeable than it once was (like I have to drift my eye across the correct light conditions to see it, like if I drift it over the scrollbar at the edge of a computer screen) and it has become smaller, but it's still there - and it hasn't really changed since maybe a year after it first appeared.

I had a scare recently where I saw another mark in the same eye, but I'm having sinus pains after a recent bout of flu and fortunately this didn't stay. Still, it's made me super-conscious of this.

However, when I look up PVD symptoms online, such as here...

[https://www.rnib.org.uk/eye-health/eye-conditions/posterior-vitreous-detachment](https://www.rnib.org.uk/eye-health/eye-conditions/posterior-vitreous-detachment)

... they generally say that PVD symptoms should pretty much disappear within a few months, and this has remained.

I can live with it, but it's really annoying. Sometimes I'm reading text and my eye is drawn to it, like it looks like a letter further along the page is smudged. I write as a major part of my profession so you can see why this might be irritating.

It's also worrying living with the constant fear of it getting worse. I get nightmares of waking up one morning and my whole vision is covered in them.

Anyway, if anyone can offer advice, I'd much appreciate it. Should I go back to the eye hospital and suggest they examine me again?",1,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/ebun4v/pvd_symptom_still_going_after_several_years/"")",2019-12-17 03:24:40,

However, until then, I have two issues that I’m trying to understand:


1) When I turn my head but maintain focus on a spot (an exercise my physical therapist ordered) circles appear, one big grey one and to its right a small sunburst that looks like a pull/warp deformation from photoshop (think a circle of grey with a black hole effect). Flashes happen in this region. I have trouble focusing and my eyes twitch back and forth, so there’s a lot of these exercises and, by extension, these images.

2) I’m red-green colorblind, and at night my vision seems to perceive a red LED as yellow or greenish, along with a spiky halo and a visual copy. Is this an issue with bad focusing? My colorblindness? Or could it be trauma/psychogenic? I’m so confused by this one, especially since it seems red 99% of the time.

I recently renewed my prescription for glasses in South Korea. I am not a native speaker of Korean and English is my first language so there is some difficulty in fully understanding the optometrist I visited.

From what I can gather researching my prescription I am far sighted. Prior to being tested in Korea I was only tested in New Zealand and told to wear my glasses for close up work (reading, computer, etc). The first time I saw an optom. in Korea, he told me to wear my glasses all the time. Since doing so I have had a dramatic reduction in headaches which I now attribute to my vision. 2 years later I have renewed my prescription and am a little confused once again. 

My prescription is:

OD Nothing written in SPH +0.25 CYL 85 Axis 69 PD

OS +0.25 SPH +0.25 CYL 90 AXIS 

I have read this is an extremely weak prescription and should not make any significant change to my vision. Is this true?

I got the infection on my upper lid first, then lower. The doctor prescribed me drops and cream over the phone. At the apothecary they only had drops, and the woman told me ""well the cream is the same so I don't know why he would prescribe both"". I took whatever they had.


Anyways, the infection went away and I am left with this red lesion that's been there for a month and is not healing. It doesn't hurt, but I can feel it's there and it's uncomfortable. 


I googled and well of course it told me I have cancer! I urgently booked an appointment with my gp. He wasn't happy that I used only drops and not cream. He agrees there is indeed some growth but believes it's benign and it's a leftover from the infection that will probably resolve in several months. He refered me to an eye specialist but I probably won't get an appointment for another 2-3 weeks. He didn't prescribe anything. 


I am still very concerned about this growth. I think even if my gp thinks it's not benign, he wouldn't tell me.

eden3e,Barrier Laser Photocoagulation for Retinal Hole," 

Hello,

I am a 31 year old female. I had lasik surgery back in 2013 to correct a mild nearsighted prescription. A few years ago I noticed my right eye was regressing and had become a little blurry, but with both eyes I still had excellent vision. I have also always had floaters but never an increasing amount.

A few months ago I started noticing flickering lights at the top of my vision. I would always think the lights were flickering at work and home, but they weren't. Yesterday I went to an opthamologist and he said he found 2 small retinal holes in my right eye. He suggested ""barrier laser photocoagulation"" surgery. He said it was a short but painful procedure with a high rate of success. The surgery is booked for 3 weeks from now.

Has anyone had this done? Or has any insight to the procedure? I am FREAKED OUT. My anxiety is through the roof. Of course I have read about the potential complications of the surgery and its really concerning me. I am aware that not having the surgery puts me at risk of a retinal detachment.

Interestingly enough, the opthamologist told me retinal holes are more common among those who have had Lasik. I wish I knew that.

Any insight would be great.

I don't know exactly what a field of vision of 140 degrees means, but I'd say if I am looking directly straight and don't articulate my eyes in any direction, I can hold my hands straight out at my sides and see both of them. I'm no math major but that sounds like I can see 180 degrees.

Spoiler: They said I failed the vision test. It was not on a standard eye chart. Was a contraption where you rest your forehead and look into some binoculars and there are three columns of numbers.

1: When I turn my eyes too far to the sides or even up or down, I seem to get a bluish grey dimming the fills up close to the center of my vision. For example, if I look too far to the left then I get a dimming in my right eye near my nose. Same thing when I look to the right, I also get the dimming in my left eye, near my nose. Almost seems like a dim circle, definitely not floaters. It fades out when I look back/normal. I can notice this especially when its cloudy outside, and I Look around. The dimming quickly fills close to the center and fades just as quick when Im done turning my head/looking around.

2: In extremely bright environments, and dimly lit environments I notice flashes and wavy lines (NOT floaters) in the peripheral vision of both eyes when I move them left to right. If I also keep my vision fixed on one point and shake my head back and forth (like I'm shaking my head ""no"") this also induces flashes in the peripheral of both eyes.

efbohp,"My eye (eyelid?) is bleeding, but an ophthalmologist told me he saw nothing wrong","Hi there, 

Hoping that at the very least my posting here will let me know I’m not paranoid over nothing (or, let me know that I AM. Either way). 

Back in July, I rubbed my eye (while wearing contacts, as I frequently do. I’m always careful to be gentle) by putting my finger on my eye lid and just kind of moving it back and forth. When I stopped, I noticed my finger was wet, and when I glanced in a mirror a bit later I saw some dried blood. 

When I rub my eye, it kind of pushes my top lid over my bottom lid. The eye itself appeared fine, so it led me to believe the blood was coming from my top lid. 

I saw an ophthalmologist, as this went on for about a week. Any time I rubbed my eye, it bled (my eye was also swollen/misshapen during this period). However, he said he saw nothing wrong. “Sometimes shards of contact lenses can cut your eyelid” was his explanation. 

TONIGHT: I rub my eye like usual, and there’s a ton of blood. I’m a reddit newbie so I don’t know how to show pictures, but I took a couple because I was nervous/shocked. 

Any ideas about why this would happen? It’s only in my right eye. And I rub my eyes all the time, but today it is suddenly bleeding again, 5 months after it did the first time.

efjbxi,Forced to look at sun with dilated eyes?,"I remember when I was about 10 years old, one of my friends older brothers was an absolute jerk and forced me to look at the sun when my eyes were dilated. 

I forget a lot of the details, but I remember I went over to their house after an eye exam and had the big goofy glasses on...we were outside and he ripped them off my face then basically forced my eyes open with his hands to look at the sky.

1) Could that event have caused my floaters?

2) I’ve had multiple eyes exams (and OCT scans) and my doctor said everything looks good. If there was some type of damage from that event, would my doctor be able to see it?

Anyways, something just feels kind of wrong or off about my vision: 

I for sure get a weird faint static like thing in my peripherals when I look at the sky 

I might get like a sort of flashes of light sometimes but could be overthinking

I possibly have a weird faint white stripish thing in hanging diagonally across my vision when I focus at a like 3-10 foot distance and/or it could be a weird enlarging of my blind spot?  It's kind of hard to tell which it is but I believe theres something going on with my right eye/side vision like that, although that may also be a symptom of my overthinking too.

Also big obligatory no insurance.

I made a post a few months ago about how my eyes just became awfully strained after short periods of reading. It didn't get much activity, but I really wanted to update so that I could help anyone that was in a similar situation.

I refused to believe that my issue was just the result of strained eyes from work. There were too many things that didn't square with that explanation. I kept looking around online, and found an article titled ""The Dry Eye Misalignment"" that basically described my symptoms exactly, and said my problem was actually an issue called ""trigeminal dypshoria"". I don't fully understand how my eyes suck, but they do. 

The good news is that there was specific lenses to correct for this, and, to date, I'd say there's been a 50% improvement in my symptoms. I can now read comfortably, which has been HUGE for me because I love reading, and spend most of my job doing it.

Just as a sort of PSA: if you have symptons that include dry eyes, eye fatigue, eye strain, headaches, and a myriad of other awful things, I seriously recommend that you go check out ""The Dry Eye Misalignment"" and see if it describes you as perfectly as it did with me. I had to get these things called NeuroLenses that were expensive as all hell, but they're worth it for me.

Hey everyone. I've been an frequent poster on here recently as my eyes have kinda been acting up. You all have been very helpful and I thank you for that. 
I've had two appointments with my optometrist. Retinal imaging, dilated exams both times. And both times my eyes have physically looked okay (I have an appointment with a retinal specialist on Monday too) 
Mainly, my symptoms have been flashes, noticing lots of floaters. Things like that. My eyes tend to be a little ""wonkier"" in the morning (shimmers and stuff like that seem to be more likely to happen then). 
I've been noticing that my symptoms just seem to keep changing? Sure, I have plenty of floaters but have not been noticing new ones. I don't have many large periphery flashes but more so many pin prick sized flashes here and there both in my periphery and central vision. Sometimes they're colored, sometimes they're white. Sometimes they happen when I squint my eyes and sometimes they just happen. My eyes have felt noticably tired lately, waking up and one of them is usually extra gooey and blurry for a little while (happens when I'm getting tired at night too)
I also notice that in darker environments I notice darker areas and spots kinda appear in my peripheral sometimes if I focus in on one point. This is inconsistent though. 
Sometimes, I'll see stars, but instead of lighter they'll be darker and disappear after a second. And only be a few of them. 
I've considered the idea of a opthalmic migraine but I don't ever see the typical ""aura"" that people mention. I have a history of actual painful migraines but have never had visual disturbances now that I think of it. 
Kind of an afterthought; but I have been experiencing some photosensitivity. Mostly when going outside or looking at a bright screen. I've attributed that to my anxiety but I also figure it's worth mentioning

Question about autorefractor

In March after that prescription change I had purchased contacts and the prescription really didn't feel right. My vision was wonky, I felt woozy and drunk like maybe my vision was being overcorrected. I mentioned this to my surgeon today when he gave me my newest prescription that was weaker then the March 2019 one. He said that if they relied on the autorefractor test to determine my prescription and if it wasn't giving a correct reading due to my eye shape that it may have been an invalid prescription. To test my vision today he used these crazy looking glasses with interchangeable lenses but he did it very fast and I wouldn't say that the letter chart ever looked super super clear and he never did that ""is this one better or is this one better"". Would you accept his prescription? My vision does feel blurry in my left eye when wearing my old glasses that are a super old prescription from 2012. So I feel like the buckle did have an effect on my nearsightedness but I'm not sure that's being reflected in my newest prescription. I don't want to invest in new glasses in a bad prescription. Would it be worth while to take all 3 prescriptions to my ophthalmologist along with my surgeons explanation of the autorefractor test and get his opinion before I fill the prescription?n?

ejwj7x,Post Retinal Tear Laser Treatment Flashes.,"Hey everyone,

About 3 weeks ago, I had a retinal tear. I had a very solid, transparent floater which immediately brought on a black spot that was noticeable with rapid eye movement in my lower left peripheral. I had a laser procedure done that day. 
This probably the cause if the random light flashes.. Which would almost look like a fan blade slowly turning in the same lower left peripheral for about a month prior. 

I am now noticing a dull flash of light in the area again. Not as severe as before the tear, but I catch it every now and then.. Maybe about 4 times a day. I can't tell if it's when the light catches my eye when I'm looking in a certain direction, or if it's completely random. Are these flashes normal and part of the scarring process brought on by the laser? Or should this immediately be checked out again. I have no new floaters that have caught my attention, just the tiny blind spot from the laser, if I look up and ALL the way to the right. My followup is on the 22nd, and if light flashes are a normal side effect, I'll wait until my follow up!

**Please note: I have had a sinus infection over the last week, but I don't know if that had any bearing on this situation **

ekbfj0,Monocular Double Vision Both Eyes [28M],"Hey folks. The last few weeks I've noticed that I'm developing double vision. It's present with either eye covered, and in both eyes (the ""ghost"" is usually swapped horizontally depending on the eye). Brightly lit objects are much more noticeable than non-lit objects, and my makeshift home ""pinhole"" test (lol) shows the double visioning goes away when looking through. I have a optometrist appointment on Monday and an appointment with my neurologist on Friday.

I have a history of migraine onsets (especially visual) and also meibomitis (my eyelids tear ducts get clogged constantly). I started using tear drops this weekend in the event that it's dry eyes. I dunno if it's that because I feel like my double vision would fluctuate more, but I also have unhealthy computer habits and my eyelids/eyes definitely are inflammed/bloodshot. (I'm working on that now - trying to follow better eye strain habits)

I mostly am using this to vent because I'm nervous about the whole ordeal. I'm a developer and if my vision kicks the can, I'm basically done for. Any advice or at-home tips while I wait for my appointments would be great.

(Also, a few years ago I had an MRI/spinal tap/conduction test to rule out that my migraine onsets weren't MS or something else insidious).",1,8,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/ekbfj0/monocular_double_vision_both_eyes_28m/"")",2020-01-05 02:33:40,

The eye pain comes and goes, but the ""rings"" seem to be here to stay.  I saw a neuro-opthalmologist (I think that was her specialty) after the first couple times this happened, and she found nothing wrong with my eyes.

Caucasian female, 45, near-sighted with astigmatism, regular soft contact lens wearer.  For the last several years, there have been times when I was wearing my prescription eye glasses (like if I was cleaning my contact lenses overnight or taking a ""day off"" from wearing them), when I would get a surge of searing pressure-like pain just where my glasses touch my skull above and behind my ears.  If I didn't snatch the glasses off my face right away, the pain would intensify and sort of wrap around my skull!  And the second I did snatch the glasses off, the pain would quickly fade away and vanish.

This continued even after I changed my prescription and got new glasses.  Neither pair of glasses is too tight; one pair is actually way too big and barely touches at all, but even the slightest touch can cause the pain.  But here's the kicker: it can happen even if my eyes are closed as I put the glasses on and take them off!  So I don't think it's a vision thing at all... I think it's some sort of physical pressure point thing, like fibromyalgia, but just in this one very specific spot.  It has never happened with sunglasses, but my sunglasses are all much lighter than my eyeglasses.

el7r9c,Questions about retinal detachment and reading,"I had an operation on both eyes in June of 2019 for retinal detachment. One eye received intensive laser treatment and the other eye received surgical intervention with a recovery period of five weeks or so spent lying mostly face down and avoiding using computers or reading (but at least I really got into audiobooks). I'm not sure what caused the detachment, although I had a couple of bad falls that may have contributed. However, I'm also very shortsighted.

The operations were successful, and although my sight still isn't what it used to be, it's definitely better than it was.

I'm a Westerner living in Asia, and my surgeon gave me a couple of recommendations for maintaining the health of my eyes. Some of the advice, however, I haven't been able to find anywhere else.

He recommended I should take a ten minute break from reading from my computer screen every twenty minutes. My partner has taken this to mean I should do this forever when it comes to reading. 

However, I also have to make a living, and that means I have to use a computer or starve. Interrupting my routine that often throughout the day reduces my ability to focus clearly on my work, which is largely editing fiction to tight deadlines.

My question: **is this advice correct**? Should I, in the months and years following retinal detachment surgery, always seek to take a ten minute break every twenty minutes that I'm reading? Can reading actively cause damage to my retinas?

el86t6,"Constant watery eyes for months, sore eyelids","I’m honestly at the end of my rope with this problem and not sure what to do. Around the middle of last year, my left eye started watering A LOT, and I was constantly wiping it every 10 minutes or so. I saw my regular doctor about it, who examined my eye and told me it wasn’t an infection, but possibly a sort of allergic conjunctivitis. She gave me Cromolyn Sodium eyedrops, which we’re supposed to give me relief in a few days, though I was told it might take up to six weeks to get better, and it might get worse before that. 

So I’ve been trying them, and they haven’t been working. What’s even worse is that it seems to have spread to my right eye as well, so about every 10-15 minutes or so and sometimes less than that, I’m constantly wiping my eyes with a tissue. They’re just watery, not itchy and usually don’t hurt. 

In the morning when I wake up, the outside of my lids are dry or crusty with watery discharge, and beneath both of my eyes and over the top of the left, tiny wrinkles have formed, which I think is a consequence of wiping my eyes with my hands at times, stretching the skin. 

I’m not sure what’s causing this in the first place, though I think it’s either a buildup of dust in my room causing an allergy (doubtful, but I don’t keep my room as clean as I should), or possibly traces of liquid nicotine getting in my eyes, as I have a bad habit of wiping my vape stuff and then mistakenly using the same tissue to wipe my eyes. I’ve done this on occasion, and my eye would immediately start burning, so I’d go to the sink and flush it out. Obviously, I’m much more careful about this now. 

But my eyes are driving my nuts, and the sides, beneath them, and the top lids can often get sore. I’m not sure if that’s from me wiping them, or the tears themselves irritating my skin.

em9xzx,PLEASE HELP,"I've always had good vision and like to think I still do however I have been experiencing sudden changes in my vision that I will now try and explain. 

1) I have always seen some lines around a source of light, especially a bright one. I remember as a kid squinting and making them exaggerate and come down to the edges of my vision. But recently it has been far more exaggerated! Like headlights occupy a large portion of my visual field with rainbow lines exploding out and curving around my eyeball to the edge of my visual field, when they hit eachother (two or more light sources) they create a grid of adding and subtracting color dots very small. 

PLEASE READ THIS ONE TOO BEFORE RESPONDING

2) The ""Starbursts"" are largely consistent and are most troublesome with the sun and headlights how ever this next symptom is pretty rare. On some days, especially night time when my eyes seem tired/strained, I will have a very uncomfortable feeling associated with using both of my eyes that I can blink to alter/fix.. sometimes a decently large glob will occupy a portion of my vision in one eye and will move around Everytime I blink, when it is over my pupil, assumably, and I look at light, the light will appear hazey, blurry, and wavey with geometry like circles and curvy concentric lines and colors. I can temporarily blink to move it around in my eye and I can physically feel in my eyelids. It's comparable to the sensation of waking up and having dry blurred vision that is instantly fixed by wetting your eyes and I can temporarily fix and prevent it from happening by smearing liquid over the effected eye. It is worth mentioning that during these times of the smudgey dry eye phenomenon, the star bursts are extra pronounced and have a weird smudge or blur over the light source and it is really hard to see very very far away lights. It's much worse for far away lights

My eyes will also randomly twitch, but only left and right, and it lasts maybe less than a second.

en2b73,"How worried should I be about primary acquired melanosis (or a nevus, or otherwise)?","Hi,

I've had a small brown pigmentation in my right eye since August 2016. For some reason I had taken clear photos of my face in July and August of that year and can clearly see that this month was when this pigmentation first appeared.

I am a 24 year old white male of middle eastern decent (Assyrian).

My only other eye problem is mild floaters, which I have long learned to live with.

For my postgraduate degree I was required to use a Class IV laser, and so before and after my degree I had to have a comprehensive eye examination conducted by the university eye clinic. Both times I was told it was nothing to worry about. The first student optometrist told me it was a nevus, and the second time (October last year) I asked their supervisor and she told me it was a melanosis.

Due to a few anxieties about my health in the recent month or two, unrelated to my eye, I brought this all up with my GP this week. Having been told it was a melanosis prompted her to investigate it further. A few days later I had seen two separate ophthalmologists at my local eye and ENT hospital who both examined my eye with a slit lamp and said it looks harmless and is nothing to worry about.

[Here is a photo of my eye from 2016 where the pigment is first visible.](https://i.imgur.com/H8YGgbi.png)

[Here is a recent, clearer photo I took this week.](https://i.imgur.com/INFRgRT.png)

The first ophthalmologist told me it looked like a melanosis, and the second said it looked like a nevus. I mentioned how everyone kept calling it something different to the second doctor (which really does matter, prognosis wise), and he told me it was hard to say exactly without a biopsy. I let him know my GP was thinking of sending me to a dermatologist to get a definitive diagnosis, to which he agreed to if I thought it would help me with my anxiety.

The dermatologist told me that she was not experienced enough in such a condition to help me, and so she referred me to another doctor in another state. My GP is working to find someone local, I think an ocular oncologist.

I feel like I'm being thrown around a lot and I'm getting sick of waiting and being anxious about this thing. Having a scientific background I am not averse to reading journal articles regarding this topic, and so far the literature on conjunctival lesions has me worried. If this is PAM, I want to know if it is with or without atypia. The statistics regarding progression of PAM to melanoma are scarce. Heck, I'm still not even sure if this is PAM or something else.

just wanted to say thanks to those who replied and update everyone: I did indeed have a detached retina! apparently I have holes all over my retinas in both eyes, and one of them finally detached on Christmas. I went in to the doctor on Friday and got a plastic band put around the eye on Monday, as well as lasers to scar over the holes. it was really though for a few days; not much pain but I kept my eye closed and couldn't do much on my own.

I've had a couple follow up appointments and the eye is doing very well. The retina has started to re-attach and I don't have to lay on my left side anymore. The doctor says I need lasers on the other eye ASAP so it doesn't detach as well. 

So yeah, just wanted to say my thanks (apparently you can be correctly diagnosed via the Internet!) and ask a few questions:

* My doctor said I should stop taking the antibiotic eyedrops and just take the steroid, but my eye still is very red, irritated and itchy. Any idea why he would say to stop the antibiotic and if that's a good idea?
* My biggest fear is that screentime contributed to this. Both my eyes have holes all over the retinas apparently, and though the Doctor didn't mention anything about screens affecting it, I work on a computer, watch stuff when I come home from work, etc. Just wondering if I should try to limit computers or get special glasses?

Today the area was swollen with a redness, and felt painful, but my eye is not red and aside from a tiny bit of morning crust, no discharge. 

I visited the eye clinic where a doctor diagnosed ""light conjunctivitis."" He prescribed me antibiotic eye drops. Now I know that's where my post should stop.

But I am slightly concerned because of the swelling and pain and because I have no other pink eye symptoms like redness, itching, or discharge.

enn65s,Recurrent Cornea Erosion Nightmares.. Need serious advice for Superficial Keratectomy or PRK.. I'm super sensitive to anything touching my eye,"My issues related to Recurrent Cornea Erosion have been continuous related to Map-Dot Fingerprint Dystrophy. :(

I never had any blunt trauma to either of my eyes. It seems to be genetic because there's no other explanation. I'm 39 years old. Early 2016, I started to wake up with that ""sand in my eyes"" or ""something stuck in my eye"" sensation. I didn't have any idea what it was. Fast forward a few months, and I woke up randomly with a 10 out of 10 on the pain scale in my left eye. Turns out it was a corneal abrasion. It healed after a week.

Six months later the same thing, just random, intense pain one morning in the middle of the night and when waking. It's been hell. Honestly, it has been some of the worst pain imaginable. I have to travel often because my kids are overseas, so I go back and forth. It's made planning for trips and logistics and nightmare. 

This has gone on like this for four years. As I type, I have a corneal abrasion in my left eye that caused massive 10 out of 10 pain on two occasions in just one week. In the mirror, the corneal abrasion is large, red, and has low-level pain throughout the day. I feel like I've reached my end.

However, I have a serious problem regarding treatment. I have used a few topical drops and gels daily, multiple times per day. The first are Hylo-Gel and Hylo-Care, the second is Solcoseryl which is a healing agent made from the blood plasma of sheep (prescribed in southeast Asia), and a few months back added regular DuraTears.

I want to do the superficial keratectomy procedure. Or the laser version of this procedure. However, I am beyond terrified. I have anxiety disorders, and so I am a nervous person in general. But I have always had a nervous reaction or maybe even a physical sensitivity to anything touching my eyes. A family member was a optometrist and he tried fitting me with contact lenses. He could never get it in my eye, even after an hour of trying. In my adult life, ophthalmologists wanted to fit me with contact lens bandages after my severe corneal abrasions, however, each time unsuccessful in getting in my eye. I'm blinking non-stop, I can't stop myself from resisting. I get beyond completely freaked out by anything touching my eye.. anything solid. So how can I ever do this procedure I need (the superficial keratectomy)? I feel really stuck here. I know I need to do it. But both psychologically and physically I can't imagine being able to successfully do it.

Can I please get some tips from how to go through with this procedure? I need tips on how to do this. I'm curious if anyone else has ever been in the same boat as me.

Then some other general questions on my mind.. I wonder is it better to do the superficial keratectomy or PRK laser treatment? The eye doctor I'm going to see again in Singapore, he is leaning toward the laser procedure, though my U.S doctor thought that it would be ""too expensive"" and ""maybe harder for you to keep your eye open."" But it seems like it might be easier to keep my eye open with the laser?

This has been such a nightmare. Please help me go through with this procedure with any tips or advice on how to do this for someone who is so sensitive with something touching my eye. My current doctor also does not agree about general anesthesia, he would only use local topical anesthesia.

Also, are the chances of recovering from Recurrent Cornea Erosions almost 100% with either of these procedures? Or is it really only 60 - 70% chance of success like I recently read in an ophthalmology article.

I'm also scared how long it would take to recover. Since just my worst corneal abrasion has taken over 10 days just with an abrasion. And this would be removing a big part of the cornea. I'm confused when a doctor in the past has (too optimistically) given a 3 - 4 day recovery time??

enonij,Questions about antihistamine use/allergies and angle glaucoma etc,"Hi

Can I post here about my eyes? Or does it need to go somewhere else?

I had the emergency kind of angles glaucoma thing, the kind where my eye suddenly went hazy and cloudy n all like a fuzzy television. When I got to hospital it was the emergency kind of close angles where my eye pressure had elevated really quickly and they had me on a drip with the medication to lower the pressure and I had to also take actual medication as it wasn't lowering. I'm not sure if that's the closed angle? Open angle ? Or what exactly? It was the emergency variety anyway which warranted a two night hospital stay.

The next day I had to have laser iridoctomy to create holes as the fluid wasn't draining because of the angles. 

However I want to ask about antihistamines use as I was using a lot just prior to all this happening and have been scared to use them ever since. I made the mistake of googling about it and it said in some individuals it can elevate eye pressure, e.g. me so I'm terrified . Was it the antihistamine use that caused all this? It's cetirizine that I was taking most days for a two week period leading up to all this happening.

I do have terrible anxiety as well but I'm still having trouble with skin allergies and reactions and there are times I need something.  I am partially sighted, with no vision in my left eye due to being born prematurely so it was super scary when all this happened to my good eye.

Would this be the case? Would it be dangerous for me to use antihistamines?  I obviously want to avoid this happening again of course, I'm very anxious about that. I will ask my eye consultant as well who I see in February 

If I need to post this elsewhere Please point me in the right direction

They have always presented as a flashing moon that typically begins in the right-hand peripheral vision, and migrates to the left, progressively consuming more of my field of vision, until just kind of evaporating away. They have always followed this same pattern.

Tonight I had one that was much different. It began as a full oval that covered both the right and left sides of my vision with a small clearing in the middle. This shape flashed and expanded outward, taking over pretty much all of my outer perimeters of vision, until also evaporating from the edges.

I could also see spots in my vision. Both of these combined reduced my vision somewhat. I saw my regular eye doctor, who was perplexed and sent me to a retina specialist. The retinal specialist noted optic nerve edema and lesions, and he diagnosed me with Multiple Evanescent White Dot Syndrome (MEWDS). I was told that it was self-limiting, and the prognosis for vision recovery was excellent. I had a follow up appointment in December, and everything seemed to be resolving.
 
Last week, I noticed that the flickering/scintillating blob was becoming more noticeable again. Saturday, I woke up, and I could see more spots in my vision. My vision is again reduced.

eogbw7,In insurance-less limbo and I’m worried my retina is detaching again after being stable for 5 years. Please help.,"In insurance-less limbo and I’m afraid my retina is detaching again after 5 quiet years. Please help.

I need to find out, on the cheap, if I’m okay or about to navigate a waking nightmare. 

Backstory: last month my spouse’s company made his entire department redundant, so Merry Christmas, you’ve been laid off. Insurance coverage ended on January 2nd and since then it’s been a struggle to get approved for the healthcare subsidy, without which we can’t afford to get on the insurance exchange, so we’re still waiting and hoping disaster doesn’t strike until we’re covered. 

However, a few days ago my left eye was playing up in a way I hoped it never would again: The scotoma in my lower left peripheral vision (left over from when my surgeon lasered the shit outta my retina to keep it tacked down) appeared more noticeable than usual. It doesn’t appear to have grown, but things in my eye suddenly seem more active — I’m not getting that wavy “sunlight filtering through a pool” refraction that I did when my retina detached 5 years ago, nor has there been a lightning strike in my vision. What there *has* been is what seems like a lava lamp in the edge of my vision — a relatively fast “bloop” of light that starts at the bottom my vision and goes up and over (so actually starting at the top of my eye and skirting down, following the line of my nose). That kind of activity seems to pick up whenever I’m laying on my side. It’s quiet when I lay on my back. 

Also — and this really set off my alarm bells — the other night I put down my phone to go to bed. The room was already dark, but when I closed my eyes it seemed like someone was shining a flashlight into my left eye. Not full-on, but like the bulb was in the outer corner of my eye. It scared the shit out of me. 

My field of vision doesn’t seem to be decreasing, but I just keep seeing that blind spot, and every “bloop” in my eye sends my blood pressure soaring. I don’t know why there’d be traction on the retina as I had a vitrectomy and there’s no posterior vitreous humor left (I interrogate my surgeon at every annual follow-up). I know it could be the stress of income loss and not knowing our next step that’s bringing an old issue to the forefront... but I am also cynical and anxious and wouldn’t be surprised if circumstances just fucked us over while we’re vulnerable. 

I can’t stand the watchful waiting, worried that something really is wrong and I won’t be able to do something about it until it become unavoidable and while it’s still unaffordable. I want to just stop into my optometrist’s office and have her dilate my eyes but we can’t swing the office visit. Optometrists/ophthalmologists: do you sometimes waive office visit fees in certain circumstances? Patients, have you ever gotten an office fee waived? If so, how do I go about doing that? What’s the follow through to make sure it gets coded properly? Is there a possible explanation for what’s going on in my eyeball that might *not* be my retina detaching again (like a little bit of vitreous humor the surgeon didn’t remove at the base just waving around in there)?

ep8afu,Recent Juvenile Glaucoma diagnosis with extremely high IOP. Are we missing any underlying issue?,"  

In June of 2019, my 17 year old daughter had her normal eye exam at our optometrist. (She is myopic and wears contacts.) This optometrist was not dilating or checking pressures in juveniles we unfortunately learned later.

In July of 2019, my daughter complained of severe eye pain in her right eye as if something was in it, which subsided after a day. A week later, she noticed peripheral vision loss herself and we visited our Optometrist. He referred us to an Ophthalmologist, who measured 60mmHg in her right eye and 30 in her left, confirmed optic nerve damage, and immediately put her on Travatan each eye at night, and two drops a day of Combigan in her right eye. This Ophthalmologist did not have Juvenile experience, so he referred us to yet a new Ophthalmologist.

A week later and several other visits at the new Ophthalmologist, eye pressures dropped to 20, and then seemed to stabilize around 15-17 in both eyes for a couple months. Therefore, the next visit was scheduled 3 months out in March of 2020. The drug therapy remained the same throughout.

Two days ago, my daughter had an Anisocoria where her right pupil was dilated about twice the size of her left pupil. We visited the Ophthalmologist yesterday, and after a serious of potential Anisocoria related questions, he measured her right eye pressure at 56mmHg. He gave her an oral diuretic in the office, a drop of Combigan, and did not let her leave until he measured 42mmHg, confirming it was reducing. He discussed that surgery might be in her future sooner than later and sees her again this Thursday. She will continue on the diuretic until she sees him.

My concern is that these IOP's measurements are extremely high of course. From her first measurement, to this second high measurement (while this time on drugs) it is obviously spiking sporadically. She is increasingly noticing her vision handicaps, including reading issues lately. I am concerned this may be progressing quickly during these high IOP spikes. She's only had one vision field test with 65% loss in her eye, and I am dreading the results of her next one.

I am concerned there could be other things going on here causing the high IOP, a subsequent Glaucoma, and now a rush to reducing IOP likely with surgery. I can tell the Ophthalmologists seem ""surprised"" at these readings, and I'm just looking for wider feedback. JOAG is rare in an adolescent, but this pattern seems rarer yet. Is Anisocoria an expected symptom of high IOP/Glaucoma? Are we missing anything else that should be investigated before heading to surgery?

erakgx,Should I Go For Another Eye Test Or Will This Get Better On It's Own?,"Hi,

My History:

I'm a 20 year old guy from Chennai. When I was 11 (in 2011), I used to apply strong pressure to my eyes with my fingers when praying. In 2013, I started getting slightly dim vision and had trouble reading from far away, so I went for an eye test and they had a dilated eye exam and said everything was ok but I was weak in distinguishing colors in the Ishihara test. I was able to read upto 6 letters in the Snellen Eye Chart. I assume that's 20/30 vision.

Since then, I've had mental issues like OCD and anxiety. I dropped out of school and stay at home most of the time, using my laptop for the whole day (sometimes more than 24 hours at a stretch though I've cut it down a little now to around 10 hours a day). 

Fast-forward to now, I still have slightly dim vision and trouble reading far away but ignored this until November 2019 when I went for another eye test but I'm not confident about this place (Udhi Eye Clinic) as they have some bad reviews online which I saw only after going there. This time, I was only able to read upto 4 letters in the Snellen Eye Chart and even my color blindness seems to have become worse. This time, the doctor said I have high power and prescribed me full-time eyeglasses. I wore it on and off for about a month and decided to go for yet another test because when I was wearing glasses, I used to have slightly cloudy vision which became clear again when I took off the glasses. 

This time I went to another eye doctor but the same place (Udhi Eye Clinic) somewhere in December 2019. This time, they didn't dilate my eyes, but they performed some tests and told me that I now have keratoconus. And they didn't tell me anything about dim vision, which was why I went for the test after all. 

My Current Symptoms:

1. Dim vision that gets worse with screen time (especially at night)

erk7yt,Hyperopia and blurried near vision with glasses,"Hello everyone,

So I could really get your opinion on what exactly is my problem, because it's really hard for me to find some answers, even with professionals when I bring it up during eye exams, maybe I just explain myself poorly.

So I'm currently 24 years old, with hyperopia and astigmatism.  
My eye correction is +4.25 (0 -0.75) and +4.50 (170 -1.25)  
This correction has been given to me through a cycloplegic test.    
I wear my glasses all the time.

I've had an eye surgery for a strabismus on my right eye when I was 7 or something.

So here's the thing, even when I wear my glasses, I cannot see clearly with my near vision, it is just blurry if I loose my eyes muscles.  
So I have to force myself to see clearly, all the time.   
It's been like that for years, I don't even know when it started to be honest, it felt like it was always like that.  
It's really hard to work like that, having a computer screen in front of me most of the time.   
Well, I can manage, but it might be the reason why I feel tired quite often when I get home, and need to rest my eyes.

I've always tried to bring it up with professionals, but they always said that it was normal, but honestly doesn't make sense to me.  
Why would it be normal, given that I wear glasses that are supposed to correct my vision?

Here's how I see exactly:  
\- Without glasses: everything is blurry. I can force my eyes and see clearly, with quite a moderate effort, my right eye is obviously back to its former position.   
\- With glasses:  
   \- long distance: clear vision, no problem. Although sometimes it feels like an eye is more efficient than the other.  
   \- near distance: blurry vision, need to use a light effort to see clearly. My right eye doesn't seem to move.  
I get diplopia when I look at small objects that are quite close. If I stare at someone within 5 centimeters, it might happen too with their head.  
I need a moderate effort to get rid of it and see clearly. 

So that's pretty much my question, what is it that I have exactly, is it some sort of presbyopia?   
It would sound really odd given that it's happened to me for years. But why not eh.

And what can I do, except bearing with it?  
Progressive lenses?   
LASIK or something similar? Wouldn't it just correct my vision just like my glasses? So I would basically need reading glasses after anyway? But at least, ""half"" of the problem would be solved let's say.

ern7al,Unexplained blind spots in vision.,"Hi, so I've been having an issue with my vision for a couple of years now. I have two blindspots in my left eye both close to the center of my vision. One of them appears to be on the location of the natural blindspot however it's bigger and way easier to spot than the one in my right eye. The other one is small and closer to the center of my vision. 


Both of them have an inconsistent appearance. If the depending on the background they tend to be a bit darker until I get used to having my right eye closed. Then they turn into the background colour. Both have never changed position or have done anything out of the ordinary.


Other visual disturbances I have:

I tend to get after images easily and for quite long periods.
Visual snow.
If I am tired and had my eyes closed for a while my vision flickers a little bit after opening my eyes. (in the dark)


What I have done:


I've been to an eye doctor who made scans of my retina and tested some others things which I can't quite recall since it's been a while. All physical tests came back clear and the blindspots weren't big enough to show up on visual field tests.
 

I have also been to a neurologist who got me a MRI scan which also came back clear.

ernlyz,Questions About Dealing with Light Sensitivity from an Iris Sphincter Tear,"About a year ago I snapped an exercise band into my eye and suffered a hyphema. Everything healed well except I was left with an iris sphincter tear that left my pupil unable to constrict all the way. I'm fine at night, on a cloudy day, or in the twilight hours but if the sun is out and if I'm near any windows or go outside without complete-facial-coverage sunglasses on its fairly intolerable.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering a few things:

* I've been told this is irreversible damage. Is there any research going on right now that might give me hope that at some time in the future this damage could be reversed?
* Does anyone have recommendations on just psychologically dealing with light sensitivity or permanent injuries like this to one's vision? Some days I only think about it a few times during the day and other days it just eats me up that I'm going to have to see like this for the rest of my life. On those days it is torture that I would not wish on anyone.
* I tried pilocarpine drops once and they gave me a bad headache. They did successfully constrict the pupil but they did it so much that it was actually too dark. I'm considering asking for a lighter dose and trying to push through the headaches until they maybe go away. Are the risk of side effects, particularly with pressure, worth it for long term, daily usage?
* Would it be a good idea to just force myself to go outside without sunglasses? Is there a chance I'd get used to the light more that way or would I just do damage to my eye? I do get headaches sometimes when I forget my sunglasses at home and it causes my eye to ache a bit.
* I now have a compulsive habit where I close one eye and then the other to see the difference in the light of how I see the world vs. how I'm supposed to see the world. It really is just torture and a constant reminder of my injury, but I can't seem to kick the habit. Any suggestions on how to stop noticing the difference so much and to stop obsessing over it and doing this little habit?
* I find it strangely comforting that a couple of celebrities share the same injury as me - [David Duchovny](https://www.thethings.com/15-things-you-didnt-know-about-david-duchovny/) and [Melissa Benoist](https://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00145113.html) (unfortunately hers from tragic domestic violence). Having some sort of community to commiserate over this sort of injury and share coping strategies for it would probably be helpful, but I haven't been able to find any. Is anyone aware of this sort of thing?

Obviously not asking for diagnosis, but was wondering if anyone here did know of anything weird it could be, and what you think it may be (obviously if there's any major red flags I'd see a doc)

Also, if it helps, I saw a retinal opthalmologist (and my OD twice) recently and my eyes looked perfectly fine according to him. My blood pressure has been high for a while though due to crazy stress

Anyway, he told me that my corneas are completely fine and my eye health is fine and that all that is wrong with me is that my eyes are dry (either due to reduced tear production or low oil production) so the cornea doesn't always focus properly and that I dont have keratoconus.

es5v2m,Please help me describe my symptoms- possible double vision?,"So, ever since about Christmas or so, I've had what I think is double vision. I think it might also be called ""ghosting""? At first, I thought it was just blurry vision. It's most noticeable against shiny objects or where there's noticeable contrast, like black text on a white background.  Everything is sort of shifted, sometimes downwards, sometimes to the side. It's not usually a complete copy of the image, moreso like an overlapping? Seems to happen in both eyes, and I haven't really noticed it happening more during one point of the day over others. I don't really have dry eyes, though I am on Claritin daily for allergies. I used to wear contacts daily but haven't really worn them that much over the past couple weeks.

I saw an optometrist back in the beginning of January.  He said my eyes worsened a bit (-1.5 and -1.00 I think) and that I have a very slight astigmastism, but not enough that would be causing the double vision- does this sound right? He couldn't find a reason for the vision problems. I'm not exactly sure which tests he did? (It was at an America's Best, so I'm sure it was the basic tests plus the one for I think glaucoma that you pay extra for...). He sent me to a PCP who ordered an MRI to rule out MS- thankfully, the MRI was negative. My basic lab work also came back normal except for mildly elevated fasting glucose (thanks PCOS). The PCP wants me to see a neurologist anyway since I have a slight hand tremor (that I've had for like 10+ years). My appt is tomorrow morning, so I want to be able to describe my symptoms as accurately as possible. I'm assuming she's just going to refer me to a neuro-ophthalmologist anyway.

My new glasses don't really help with the double vision, just the blurriness. I've used glasses for a long time now, so wouldn't they have noticed any significant astigmatism before now?

Naturally, I panicked, and after consulting Dr. Google (this is where I get introduced to ocular melanoma), I went to see an optometrist. I have been to both an optometrist and ophthalmologist; both have conducted a dilation exam and found nothing of concern in the back of my eye. However, in the following days, I have experienced the following symptoms :  


\- increase in eye floaters  
\- starburst/halo effect around lights at night (lenticular astigmatism?)  
\- dry feeling

I now have fears of a tumor growing in the anterior segment in the eye (possibly in the ciliary body) that is causing these symptoms; tumors in the anterior segment of the eye can be hard to spot via dilation and the symptoms of a ciliary body melanoma match the symptoms that I am experiencing now (floaters, lenticular astigmatism). Obviously this is only my own assumptions and I am not a medical expert by any means, but I have not undertaken any tests that check the anterior segment of the eye. I for sure damaged my eyes using that ointment, and I don't have any other explanation for my symptoms. Does anyone know what is going on? What are the chances that these symptoms are caused by a tumor growing in my eye from the ointment I used? I know I sound like a hypochondriac, and I realize that I have no one to blame but myself for what I am experiencing.

et7yhj,Frequent Eye Flashes - should I worry?,"43, Male, Patient, Myopic

(Posting from r/Ophthalmology \- was asked to post here)

Background: I am a patient.

I went for a routine checkup last Friday with an ophthalmologist and while he was examining my eyes, he asked if I saw **floaters**. I told him that I used to notice some a few years back but not any longer. Upon the completion of the checkup, he told me that my eyes were healthy.

Strangely, after the I started noticing *more* floaters, and to make things worse, when I tried to sleep, I started seeing **flashes** in both of my eyes. Panicking, I called the clinic and went there for another checkup (on Tuesday).

This time, the nurse put some eye drops to dilate my pupils and the ophthalmologist did another examination (during which he stuck a device into my eyes which looked like a hand-held microscope).

He told me that my eyes were healthy, and the floaters were just ""impurities"" and not a result of retinal tear.

I asked him about the flashes, and he told me that I shouldn't be worrying about it unless I see them more frequently (a couple of times an hour).

Well, guess what?

***I now start seeing more frequent flashes - a few times an hour!***

I am not sure if the floaters and flashes were always there (and it was just me not noticing it), or I am just alarmed over nothing. After all, the ophthalmologist said there was nothing to worry about.

Should I worry and get a second opinion?

People with eye flashes: do you see them multiple times per hour?

Do eye flashes go away eventually?

I last visited an eye doctor about 11 months ago, and they said I have a freckle on the back of that eye. I also wear contacts for 10-12 hours a day about 6 days a week, and usually spend 8-12 hours a day looking at a computer screen. I haven't experienced any changes in my vision.

I feel like it doesn’t quite latch onto my eye properly (hoping someone can relate to that) it does stay in the full day but something doesn’t feel right, not sure if it tends to move about or not as my vision someone goes blurry in that eye. It doesn’t feel like it’s sitting right on my eye, unsure what this could be as the left eye is perfect, I don’t feel a thing in that eye.

Hello! I have had a horrible case of pink eye for about two weeks. I rubbed my eye so much the first week and a half that I got a small scratch on my eyeball that resulted in excruciating pain for about 24 hours and then I decided to go to the Ophthalmologist.

It’s been 3 days and my eye feels fine, the scratch was really small and I want to take out the contact. It is driving me crazy and I cannot see. My doctor said that if it “fell out” before I go back to see him on Monday then to use the ointment 3 times a day instead of only once at night.

eujqeh,This is it.. possibly going for PTK surgery this week for RCE / map-dot-fingerprint-dystrophy that I've had for four years.. Need advice,"I'm so sorry this post is long \*sigh\* but this is it.. Thinking to possibly go for the PTK surgery THIS WEEK. Four years suffering from recurrent cornea erosions.

Hi everyone, I posted a few weeks ago about wanting to do the PTK surgery to help with my RCE caused by map-dot-fingerprint-dystrophy. I have it in both eyes. It started spontaneously in early 2016, with a full blown erosion in August, 2016 where I was a 10/10 on the pain scale for 5 - 6 days, and couldn't open my eyes for a week, and blurry for weeks and months after that. That was after the warning signs of ""something in my eye"" and slight pain in my eye proceeding the first erosion. In the past four years, I have had about 8 other ""major"" erosions"" in the left eye. Then about 1.5 years ago erosions started in my right eye too, but only one ""major"" erosion in my right eye. So though both eyes suffer from this, but I am mainly thinking to focus on solving it in the left eye since it seems to be much worse -- with more frequent and more severe erosions than the right eye.

I posted a few weeks ago to this group about how my main concern about the PTK surgery is that I have an extreme anxiety / jerking reaction to anything touching my eyes. My whole life I've never been able to the ""air puff"" / air pressure routine test at the eye doctor's office. My head jerks away rapidly every time. I have had eye doctors try multiple times to fit me with contact lens. When I was a teenager, I wanted contacts so badly, but after trying a few times gave up when the doctor couldn't get a practice lens in my eye. It even took me months to put eye drops in my eyes. Even now I can't just keep my eye open and wait for the drop, it's still far easier to put the drop on the outside of my eye, and then blink rapidly to get it inside.

I posted a few weeks ago about how scared I am how this is torture and I've been suffering for four years, like the rest of you all. I WANT to the surgery. The will is there. But I am deeply concerned how I can't handle the ""air puff"" at the doctor's office and I've never successfully found a doctor who could put a contact lens in my eye, and therefore, practically speaking, I am wondering how.. how can I do this PTK surgery?

But I am back in Singapore now. I have a 90 day visitor stay. Which means if I am going to do the PTK surgery, then I need to do it ASAP to allow for as much time as possible to recover. I am seeing a cornea specialist here, who doesn't specialize in RCE cases.. but he is a cornea specialist who even does cornea transplants on a routine basis. His ""bedside manner"" is better than another other eye doctor I have ever worked with. He seems genuinely friendly, caring, and takes time to answer questions. So I am at the point where I generally feels comfortable.

I just want to ask you guys and discuss some more about the actual PTK procedure. Needless to say, I am terrified to death, and I still doubt myself completely that I can handle it or manage my way through it due to my extreme super-sensitives and anxieties that have been there since my birth regarding anything touching my eye. :'(

I know the doctor will give a very strong local anesthesia, and the drops will sting a lot but then the eye should be mostly numb. We practiced this in his office with a weakened version of the drop. That's the good news. I was also uncertain whether there would be any way to insert the speculum tool into my eye. After a few attempts we did it in a practice session a few days ago! That's the really good news. So if you can get the speculum in your eye.. would you guys who have done PTK surgery before.. are you half-way there?

What I fear most is how to handle a polished metal tool ""scrapping"" my eye.. and you cannot blink even if you try. But I worry that I will resist.. and everything could go wrong. How to not resist a metal tool scrapping one's eye? How did you get through it? What does it really feel like? I read that with the numbing drops that it feels like ""tickling"".. hmm what does that feel like on the eye? Is it really terrifying for someone who is afraid of anything touching their eye? Do you just see a metal tool take up your whole field of vision?

Starring at the laser sounds like the easy part for me personally without ever having tried it before. It will be my first time ever doing any kind of surgery or laser surgery. I can stare at a light NO PROBLEM.. it's just things touching my eye.. that's the problem. 😢 The doctor also says it's only like 15 - 20 seconds. I can handle that (I think!)?!? But my understanding is that the nurse will continuously put drops in your eye while it's being forced open by the speculum to prevent dryness. So the nurse said it can be really hard to focus and ""stare past"" where you see the laser beam. The nurse advised me to just keep staring and try very hard not to take your eye off it and try to ""stare past"" it. Any other advice to keep focus even though you've just had the outer layer of your cornea scrapped off? 😢

Then the contact bandage lens is supposed to be the last step. I wonder since no doctor has ever successfully put a contact on my eye before... will the doctor be able to place the CBL on my eye with the speculum still holding my eye open? Or would he need to take the speculum out of the eye first before trying to do the CBL? I'm just worried what if he can't get it in or my eye is so sore or I'm still terrified and / or I'm still jerking away and involuntarily resisting his attempts to put it in.

I hope it's all worth it. I've tried so many drops, eyes, gels, humidifiers over the years.

Only thing I haven't tried yet.. and I have picked this idea up from reading posts in this group over the last few weeks. I will buy a pair of goggles.. so I can try wearing eye goggles to bed at night after the eye surgery is done hopefully. Could you wear the goggles over the contact bandage lens? Or must wait until it's removed from your eye first?

I am also looking at two brand new eye gels that I haven't tried. Which wouldn't arrive to Singapore for a few weeks after the surgery.. the first is Thealoz Duo GEL [https://www.thea-pharmaceuticals.co.uk/assets/products/documents/PILs/thealoz-duo-gel-30ud-pil.pdf](https://www.thea-pharmaceuticals.co.uk/assets/products/documents/PILs/thealoz-duo-gel-30ud-pil.pdf)

which seems like a good pervative-free one. Also I'm gonna try Vitapos which is made by the same people who make Hylo-Gel (which is the one I use for lubbrication throughout the day and night).

Finally, I know this post is very, very long. It might be hard for some people to follow all the words. But I'm just trying to put all the discussion into one post.. but I'm concerned about the post-op pain and recovery. In western countries lik the U.S and Australia they would prescribe a narcotic.. but here in Singapore (the country where I am visiting for three months).. narcotics for the most part are NOT AVAILABLE. I asked the cornea specialist about it.. he said he has to prescribe Naproxen, Ibuprofen, etc. after the surgery. Yikes. I'm scared. He said if those aren't enough he can prescribe a Codeine mixture (which is very weak.. I know from past experience). Will I be able to handle this especially the first 2 - 3 days. Is this major surgery where they slice off the outer layer of the cornea and blast you with a laser, really no worse than a bad erosion? Usually with a bad erosion 90% of the time.. it lasts for a few hours.. only 10% of the time especially in the beginning did the pain from the erosion last for several years continuously.

There are misc. things I'm uncertain about too. What about potential complications? What if the first surgery doesn't heal properly and need to do it a second or third time? I'm just trying to figure out how to get through it a first time. What are the chances that it will make the RCE better and not worse?",1,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/eujqeh/this_is_it_possibly_going_for_ptk_surgery_this/"")",2020-01-26 21:53:24,

Please know I'm not asking for medical advice, I have my regular eye doctor and a retina specialist I am seeing and am not using this as a substitute, just trying to find out more information since I can't keep bugging them for information, and only asking for personal advice from anyone with experience on this as a patient or medical practitioner to supplement what information I have and fill in my personal gaps on the medical advice I am receiving from my doctors to try to understand better and feel more at ease since this is a rather stress inducing role for me to be in.

I'm in my mid/late 30s, and for at least a few years now, since early 30s if not more, whenever I go for my yearly eye exams the doctors have told me to go to the ER or call an emergency number if I see floaters, lights, etc. I finally asked why this time and was told my retina on one eye looks like it has a 'thin spot', and was referred to a retina specialist.

After I saw the retina specialist I was told the thin spot was on both eyes, but no signs of retinal tears or detachments. However that this surgery was commonly used to create scar tissue that will help prevent retinal tears and detachments.

That being said, I've looked online and can't find much about this being used pre-retinal tear or pre-retinal detachment, other than the mention that sometimes it is. I'm just wondering what to expect, risks, how long before I should be able to return to work safely (my current job involves a lot of walking, lifting, and bending over), if anyone has heard of possible alternatives, etc?

I've seen mentioned that after photocoagulation for retinal detachment or tear that someone should avoid all exercise and physical work for a period of weeks (3 is mentioned on some, 6 on others). In other places I've seen that the head needs to be in a certain position to keep an air bubble in place for a few weeks. I'm not sure how much of this applies when this is used as preventative, but does anyone have any thoughts on this? Am I likely to be unable to return to work or the gym for 3-6 weeks? Will I possibly need to sleep in a particular way or not lay down in a particular way?

I've also read that it can cause loss of central and peripheral vision, as well as decreased night vision. Is this common? To what extent is most common and to what extent is possible, not including outlying cases where complete blindness due to something going wrong, just in regular cases?

If you were the patient would you see this as a reasonable solution/risk mitigation at my age compared to not doing it (your personal opinion just based on what I've provided)? Are there alternatives?

Also, are there possible long term side effects or precautions I'll need to take? I enjoy martial arts, particularly Judo and Jiujitsu and these involve some rather hard falls at times, is this something that might be dangerous after this is fully healed?

evrwdu,Potential remedy for eye redness,"So, I've had chronic redness in my right eye for around the last fifteen years. My vision, eye pressure and tear film are fine, the issue is solely cosmetic. Every doctor, optician and optometrist has told me that there's no clear pathology - some have hinted at ocular rosacea and sun damage - but all have said I will have to live with it, and just recommend things like eye wipes and hot/cold compress. 

I'm by no means the worst off (vision is still intact) but it's not the easiest thing to live with. Throughout high school and university, it was frequently brought up and served to regularly knock my confidence. Currently, I work as a teacher and pupils have accused me of taking drugs and getting high before class; it's deeply humiliating. As you might expect, continually being judged as or even directly told you look 'high', 'drunk' or 'tired' takes its toll on your mental health and self-esteem. 

I have tried every drop imaginable, from steroids and artificial tears to hypromellose and allegery drops, nothing has worked.

In 2018 when I discovered a new drop claiming to conceal eye redness whilst minimising the rebound redness and tachyphylaxis, I was cautiously optimistic. It was the first serious jump forward in tackling this problem. The drops were labelled as Lumify and contained the active ingredient brimonidine tartrate.

Upon using it, I can attest to the claim: it worked. The drops gave me several hours of feeling normal, not being constantly self-conscious of my redness. It was bliss. 

I began using them as frequently as I felt necessary, sometimes up to 4x a day (the maximum recommended amount). However, eventually issues arose. 

The drops contain BAK, a preservative that I've found difficult to tolerate in the past. Eventually, taking lumify regularly became an impracticality. The preservative in the drops were causing me too much irritation for regular use. 

Since then I've continued to seek out another remedy. I have purchased online a bottle of alphagan p 0.1 brimonidine tartrate. Again, it works at taking the redness out and the purite causes me no irritation whatsoever. 

The ingredients are as follows:
Brimonidine Tartarate 1 mg (0.1% w/v)
Stabilized Oxychloro Complex (Purite™) 0.05 mg (0.005% w/v)
Purified Water IP q.s.

I'm aware that this is quite a lot of brimonidine tartare to be using 5-6 days a week, I think at least? (correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I'd build up tolerance quite quickly on a dose this high).

So I was thinking of buying a larger dropper bottle and pipette along with some purified water online. Then squirting the drops into the bottle and distilling it down with the purified water. Would probably distil it down to something around 0.05-0.025% w/v or less. 

My question to the eye specialists of reddit are: is this safe? Is there anything I should take into account when doing this? Will it be okay to use normal purified water purchased online? Do you think this could work long-term? 

I understand that this may seem like a big effort just to whiten the eye but this is something I've struggled with my whole life, I'm desperate to at least mitigate this condition, especially for work (at the very least).",1,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/evrwdu/potential_remedy_for_eye_redness/"")",2020-01-29 11:39:35,

evtueo,7 weeks post Trans PRK and intermittent pain.,"I underwent trans-Prk seven weeks ago (Dec 12). My right eye has healed without a problem. But my left eye has been bothersome.  At three weeks post op (around new years eve week), I suffered what I think were three corneal erosions in my left eye (extreme pain caused by opening and closing my eyelids at night). I was seen by my optometrist who put a yellow stain in my eye and noted that I had some dry spots in my eye and noted that due to pattern I may not be closing my eyes fully at night. She told me to use preservative free drops every hour and to put systane night ointment at night if I could not find Muro 128. When I had my third episode, I texted my surgeon who  told me to put preservative free drops in my eye every 30 mins and Muro 128 at night for two weeks. I did as instructed and also started Omega 3 Supplements and putting a gel bead eye mask on my eyes two times a day for ten minutes. At night I resorted to taping my eyelids with paper tape just so I felt calm enough to sleep. But I continue to experience daily intermittent pain (pulsating/pulling sensation with a nasal congestion like headache) on my left eye that ranges from 2/10 (aware of it only when I pay attention to it) to 4/10 (I am aware of it but can continue with activities). I get the 4/10 pain at least once a day for 10 mins but today it lasted 1hr to 1.5 hrs.  But yesterday, my best day I only experienced pain once (4/10) for 10 to 20 mins before falling asleep. My surgeon told me last week to use  Muro 128 for one month this time and continue drops every 30 mins. Also I now have floaters but they don't bother me as much anymore  (they dilated my eyes and said no retinal detachment). I am worried that I have  corneal neuropathic disease, corneal neuralgia, which I think needs to be addressed promptly to avoid complications. I don't know if I am being overly concerned or if I should be a strong advocate about my symptoms. My next post op is in three weeks (my last post op was 2.5 weeks ago), will I be ok to wait? Should I ask them to assess me right away? Should I ask my optometrist to refer me to get a second opinion?  I look forward to some  insight.

ew4lww,Cross-eye when I wear glasses,"
Hello Reddit!

I am 20 years old male who wears glasses due to my short-sightedness (-6 in both eyes) since I was around 12. 

Since my childhood I suffer from cross-eye as well, which usually appears when I am wearing glasses, rarely without them.  It’s especially apparent when I remove the glasses-I can literally see my cross-eye getting back into normal position. 

Recently it started to really bother me so I decided to ask your opinion on this issue. Should I be worried about this condition? Or are there any exercises or (worse case) surgical method that can help me?

Thank you!!",1,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/ew4lww/crosseye_when_i_wear_glasses/"")",2020-01-30 04:21:46,
ew8z0x,How to cope with floaters?,"I want to share my experience, in the last weeks I have seen in my eyes increasing floaters and I am a little worried about that.  I went with a private ophthalmologist and everything was fine.  

  He did an eye exam that I had time without doing (2012) and I stay like this

 Myopia:

 Right eye: -1.50 (sphere)
 Left eye: -1.50 (sphere)

 Astigmatism:

 Right eye: -0.25
 Left eye: -0.75

 Axis:

 Right eye: 140
 Left eye: 24

 In 2012 I had:

 Right eye: -1.50 (sphere)
 Left eye: -1.25 (sphere)

 After that he did a retinal exam and put me a few drops to dilate the pupils and sent me to call for 15 to 20 minutes.

  I check my eye with a few lights and he told me that everything is in order and I already explained already sitting in his office that it is a gel that we have and so on, and that from the age of 30 it starts to become more common to see that and  which is called vitreous detachment, and the truth is that it is uncomfortable and already googled and says that a visectromy can be done to remove that gel, but the people who do that can have cataracts in the future, then the matter is worse.

[Article](https://www.venturacountylasik.com/manuka-honey-can-improve-dry-eye-symptoms/)


After 6 months of dry eyes (my first and worst time ever suffering from this) and inflammation, countless bottles of eye drops and gels, countless visits to opticians and an eye hospital, and a hell of a lot of warm (sometimes boiling) compresses, my situation got worse.

I found out a couple of weeks ago that I also suffer from mild blepharitis in one eye. I went to a normal opticians appointment hoping and praying that this bs would end only to find out that it got worse.

After much research I came across a manuka honey method which I've never heard of or tried before. I always assumed manuka honey was just another fad so never paid it any attention until now. I read about people putting honey on/in their eyes and thought it was absolutely crazy until I started reading countless (and I mean a shitload amount) posts on various websites about how this cured blepharitis and aided dry eyes. I still didn't fully believe it until I saw the numerous studies performed using the honey for various eye conditions - namely blepharitis and dry eyes.

I gave in and finally bought some today. I freaked out at the price until I realised I'm happily (yet still hesitantly) spending £8 on a 10ml bottle of eye drops/gel every other month which doesn't even work. £35 on nearly 20 times that amount (it's a 250g jar which I think is around 200ml) seems justifiable considering the jar will last a LONG time because you barely need 1/2 of the amount of eye drops you use. And it was on sale for 1/2 price as well so I figured it's now or never.

After trying it the first time I can honestly say my vision has cleared up quite a bit. My eyes have been feeling horrible and dry all day, like there's a grey film over them. As previous reports have said, it did burn for a couple of minutes, but after that and the tearing stopped, my eyes felt absolutely amazing. They haven't felt this clear in a very long time.

If you're willing to try it, definitely give it a go! I can't wait to see how this works in the longer term.",1,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/ewgv54/manuka_honey/"")",2020-01-30 18:03:09,

ewmhql,Eye (or neurological) issue causing blind spots," 

 

My girlfriend is suffering from a strange eye (or neurological) condition that we can't seem to get a good diagnosis from any doctor. Background on her:

23F, doesn't take any medications, 170cm, 62kg, non-smoker, no drug use, Caucasian, no existing medical issues besides polycystic ovaries, . Was on the pill when this started but has gone off it to see if this would help, it didn't

She has a history of ocular migraines. One morning around six months ago she woke up after being ill with the flu, during the night she said she had woken up with the worst head ache of her life. That morning when she woke up she had a small shimmering like scotoma in her left eye. No flashing lights or any other symptoms. We went to an optometrist and they couldn't see anything wrong with her eye, we then went to the hospital and they couldn't find any signs of stroke or anything similar and referred her to a neurologist.

She went to the neuro about a month later, she still had the same shimmering scotoma in her left eye and he diagnosed it as persistent migraine aura. We took that at face value and carried on. The problem started to subside but didn't completely go away. About 3 months ago it started to get a little bit worse and she had some more small spots pop up in her left eye. We went to an ophthalmologist and they examined her extensively for any of the white dot syndromes, tests done were (slit lamp examiniation/autofluorescent FAF/multimodal imaging/OCT/Humphrey Visual Fields. They could not find anything wrong with the left eye at all. They said her retina is extremely healthy. The visual fields test didn't show up any blind spots as they are too small to show up on that test. They told us they don't believe it can be an eye issue as something would have popped up on all the tests they did which we believe as well. We have researched white dot syndromes/AZOOR extensively and from all the research we did we believe something would have showed up as a red flag on one of those tests at least and the doctors agreed. Everything showed her eye was completely fine. They also said it must be persistent migraine aura.

Does this make sense though? As it's only in the one eye it seems unlikely it could be as retinal migraines do not persist for this amount of time.

It is starting to cause her a level of anxiety and distress. We are scheduled in to see a neuro ophthalmologist but that is not for another 3 months. Could this perhaps be due to some nutritional imbalance, or an underlying disease such as Lyme disease? She recently had a blood test and we are awaiting results.

I looked in the mirror to find very noticeable dropping of my upper right eyelid and my pupils being different sizes. I called my aunt thats a nurse and she urged me to go to the ER as its a symptom of a stroke or aneurysm. I went to the hospital, I had a brain MRI and everything was normal. that evening I began having excruciating back pain.

I was referred to an ophthalmologist where he diagnosed me with horners syndrome He told me about carotid tears and all that, chalked it up to that being the cause and sent me on my way. However, My MRIs did not show a carotid tear so i don't think he even really looked at my chart which is frustrating. The following week my back pain was so severe I returned to the hospital. This time I had chest X-rays and a cervical MRI. Everything was normal for the most part, I had slight cervical lordosis and some swelling in my throat.

I then went to a neurologist who said that he believes my horners was caused by a viral infection that im recovering from that somehow disrupted my nerves. I have a scheduled CT for a week from now to check on the that swelling and I have a follow up with an ENT later in the month.

My symptoms aren't improving at all and i'm worried about how this could all be related.

ewzjtq,Redness in eyes for years.,"I have dealt with redness in the eyes ever since I was 18. I am now 36. I used to see it in both eyes, but the last few years I have only had it in my right eye. It's only on the exposed cornea on the inside corner of my eye, but sometimes it'll be red on the outside. It does seem like that eye is dryer than the other, but I only have very mild discomfort and it doesn't itch. I normally wouldn't post on here, but I have literally seen countless eye doctors over the years. Every visit turns out the same. They do a thorough exam and find no signs of infection or any issues whatsoever. So each one gives up and prescribes something like Zylet or Alrex. I usually use it for a few days only and symptoms disappear for months then eventually come back. Most doctors assume it's some allergy. I've tried changing soaps, detergents, everything.

ey5t7o,Solar retinal damage?,"So the issue started when it was extremely sunny where I live and everywhere I go the sun is bouncing off cars, buildings, glass etc to the point that there is sun glare nearly everywhere you look outside. I started to become really aware of how the glare and where the sun was that I would keep trying to avoid looking in those directions, often looking down a lot of the time which is strange because I've never done so before. When I'm in the car and driving down the road I notice the sun in my peripheral vision and it bugs me because I didn't used to see it or notice it before and I worry about damaging my eyes. The reason why I've been so concerned is because my vision has been worsening, I was at a -3.75 in both eyes but I can tell my vision has become blurrier and when I went to the opticians they upped my prescriptions (twice at two appointments 2 months apart), they said my retina looks healthy but they didn't do a dilated exam or anything.

eyclg8,"Medically induced hyperthyroid, strabismus surgery. Sorry, back story is kind of long.","I'm a 59 year old female with hypothyroidism, had cataract surgery in 2017 and have been kept hyperthyroid with meds for the last few (3-4) years.  I think they kept me hyper hoping I'd lose weight.  My endo said as long as I wasn't having heart problems he'd keep me there.

For the last year to year and a half, I've been having double vision (distance only) and have had trouble moving my eyes; for example it's difficult for me to look around a store without moving my body -- can't just move my eyes -- my eyes feel stiff.  Both were getting progressively worse.

I've been seeing an optometrist and have tried prisms -- didn't work and then I was moved to a ophthalmologist who wants to do eye muscle surgery.

I had labs done for my endo at the end of December and saw that I was still hyperthyroid and decided to do some research to determine if the hyperthyroid could cause my eye problems and it looked like it could, so I reduced my thyroid medication on 12.29.2019 with the approval of my endo.  My vision is improving, I still have some distance double vision and it's hard for me to look straight ahead at times, especially if it's bright.  The eye stiffness has made a drastic improvement. 

I know I'm improving, but the ophthalmologist said (through his nurse) the thyroid eye problem has nothing to do with the eye muscle surgery and he wants to go ahead with the surgery.  I've pushed it off for a month.

I've read I should not have eye muscle surgery until the swelling in my eyes is gone.  How will I know when that happens?  I wonder if this is as good as my eyes will get -- did I cause damage by continuing hyperthyroid for so long and should I just go ahead and have the eye muscle surgery?

One other thing, it seems my double vision is worse after wearing my bi-focals or reading glasses.  Just seems like it takes my eyes a while to adjust.  Do you think that will go away once my eyes return to normal?

They’re most visible the brighter the object and the longer I look at it, but there’re definitely not just normal afterimages as I used to get. These can persist in my vision anywhere from 10 seconds to 5 minutes, depending on the brightness. And the brighter they are the more prominent they appear in my vision. For example, if I look at the car’s rear view mirrors in front of me for about 10 seconds, I can look up to the sky and still see them. Even if I close my eyes they’re still there, very vivid and clear. I also noticed, if the object is bright enough the afterimage is positive, if it isn’t that bright they’re negative.

I still need to have a follow up with my retina specialist, but from our last meeting, it sounds like with anything physical ruled out, she was going to label my visual distortions as ""ocular migraines"" and stop looking for a cause.

My first eye doc appointment went pretty badly. We confirmed I have a cataract on my right eye (completely cloudy and honestly blind). I mentioned to the doctor that I had eczema, and he immediately said he could not operate due to that. He told me to call him when I'm cured.... 

My skin on my face is not bad. It's not cracking or anything of the sort, it's just flush and I have pink cheeks.

I was put on steroid ( Prednisolone) and homatropamine for 10 days. My vision waa continuously blurred from the day time of trauma.

Today id a follow up with a retina specialist. He perfomed slit lamp test and deduced that there are no retinal breaks and hemorrhage is clearing.

Im having blurred vision and he said that is due to Traumatic Cataract. Also, The RE IOP was 32 mm of Hg. 

He also performed gonioscopy and and gave me the following observations.

1. No treatable lesion or retina break.
2. Clearing vetrious and Hyphema almost gone.
3. TRAUMATIC Cataract. EARLY PSC
4. TRAUMATIC MYDRIASIS.
5. Increased IOP

The action plan is to control IOP. Following drops are prescribed.
1. Fluorometholone ( inflammation)
2. Nepafenac ( inflammation)
3.Dorzolamide ( pressure)
4.Brimonidine Tatrate + Timolol Maleate( pressure)
5. Homatropine


The doctor said that ive developed traumatic cataract due to which im having media haze. The hemorrhage is clearing but vision may get blury due to formarion of PSC.

High IOP indicates that Im prone to traumatic Glaucoma and this is one thing that is worrying me a lot. He has asked me to follow up in 2 days to check if pressure is coming under control.  He cleared that Ive not  developed Glaucoma yet but the risk associated is high

Im having follw up day afyer tomorrow now to check if the pressure is reduced.

Please help me with these queries since it's difficult to cope up with this stress full situation

1) is it possible that steroid use( Prednisolone 6 times/day + Wysolone 60mg/day ) for 10 days might have initiated this PSC Cataract?

2) The doctor didnt talk anything regarding Angle recession/ angle closure. Although he did genioscopy but didn't provide any inputs. Does his prescription put any lights that I may have developed Glaucoma like conditions?

3) Is the blurry vision only due to Cataract now? Since retina is stable, vitreous is clearing, hyphema is minimal. 

4) Any other remedies that might keep the IOP in check.

Two years ago, he got shingles in both eyes, and it destroyed most of the vision in his left eye and big decrease in vision in his right.  Last year, the pressure in his left eye was so high for so long, that a chemical enucleation was done to kill the optic nerve.  A few months ago, he got another infection in his left eye that caused a corneal ulcer.  He has been doctoring for that and it seemed to be healing nicely.  But the ulcer was deeper than originally thought.

Friday morning, around 2 am, his cornea ruptured.  He was in terrible pain until we got him to ER for pain control, prior to surgery to patch his cornea.  Now he has to either have an evisceration or an enucleation early next week.

Here’s the problem:  he’s 92.  His immune system is shot.  His eyes seem to be his Achilles Heel.  His ophthalmologist is leaning toward evisceration, but said he will still be susceptible to more infections. So he might end up with an enucleation anyway.  Plus, he would have a prosthesis to put in (and clean), which he would be unable to do.  

So, would it be better to have it all removed?  Then it would be over.  No going out without the prothesis.   He also has Parkinson’s and chronic lumbar pain.  These surgeries are really rough on him, and throw him into a few days of dementia.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 39, male, living in Europe, Poland, have Retinitis Pigmentosa (&lt;10° FoV left), Glaucoma, Astigmatism (\[R: Cyl= -1.49D axis=18°; L: -0.69D/12°\]([https://imgur.com/a/1eK4xKC](https://imgur.com/a/1eK4xKC))) and on top of that Cataract in both eyes.

Cataract surgery for my right eye has been scheduled for later this month and the doctor selected ""AcrySof IQ Toric 22D"" as the IOL. 

Now my issue: while researching online, I have been severely discouraged from this particular model (AcrySof), as it has a high rate of ""Glistening"" (as I understand, this means that with time the material of the lens captures microscopic amounts of fluid, leading to stray light/glare and possibly requirement to explant/replace after longterm use). 

As I'm (fairly) young and such a lens would, therefore theoretically have to remain functional for decades, I'd prefer to limit the chance of Glistening. Among other factors, there also seems to be study-supported ""significant association between the increase of glistenings and the number of topical glaucoma medication that the patient instilled on a daily basis."" - which for me is an additional reason for caution.

Are my concerns valid or exaggerated? Are there any toric monofocal IOLs worth recommending, that are known to be stable in terms of dislocation/rotation, glistening and possible other shortcomings? E.g. enVision or Tecnis?

f2xez2,Advice on Retinal Holes/Laser Retinopexy,"See bottom of post for TLDR.

This is a very specific query I know so any advice would be much appreciated, whether it be from doctors, opticians or anyone with previous experiences with this.

Im from the UK, Male, 22 years old and I’m short-sighted (-7ish) and have an astigmatism in both eyes.

To start this off, I’ve always been extremely squeamish when it comes to my eyes - especially when it’s in relation to eye drops and things touching my eye (e.g. contact lenses). This may be an important factor in the below.

I recently went to the opticians for a general checkup/eye test and unfortunately the optician found a hole in my retina in the right eye. I hadn’t been showing any symptoms and it was just pot luck that he found it. As these can cause retinal detachment and pose a lot of risks for the future, he referred me to the hospital on an urgent referral.

Today I went to the hospital for them to investigate further. Along with general sight tests and pictures/scans of the eyes taken, I was given dilation eye drop along with anaesthetic drops for me to have the glaucoma test. Rather than the puff machine, it was a device where they touch your eyeball lightly - this freaked me out quite badly and sent my anxiety sky high. 

Unfortunately during the examination, they found another retinal hole in my left eye, and had to use a special contact lens to locate the hole in the right one. This was extremely difficult for them to do as, like I mentioned before, I am very very squeamish and find it extremely uncomfortable/distressing. I would move my head back and lift my chin off the rest provided. A nurse ended up having to hold my head in place for the consultant to put the lens in.

The consultant/doctor didn’t really go into that much detail about the holes but did mention that they have pigmentation around each of them suggesting they’ve been there for quite some time and sort of ‘self healed’. However, he said that laser treatment is something which will be a more permanent fix and lessens the risk of retinal detachment. 

My main concern is due to how squeamish I am, is this surgery really a good idea? If my eyes are self healing themselves anyway - should I risk any complications by having this surgery? What are the risks of this surgery? I’ve read that I should keep my head still and that most definitely didn’t happen earlier due to me freaking out over the contact lens. If I move/blink does this pose greater risks? Do retinopexy procedures have side effects? Is there anything that can be done to lessen my anxiety - general/local anaesthetic maybe?

I have a genuine fear when it comes to anything related to eyes and I’m terrified that something will happen which will cause me to go blind/have severe repercussions. I’m only 22 and could really do with some advice. 

Thank you in advance.

TLDR - I have 2 retinal holes with pigmentation round them, which have possibly been there for years that may require laser treatment. Please advise if you think I should do this? Note - I’m extremely squeamish and anxious with all things eyes and worry if I’ll be able to stay still.",1,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/f2xez2/advice_on_retinal_holeslaser_retinopexy/"")",2020-02-12 12:22:29,
f30if0,Advice needed,"

So I’m gonna start off by saying that my (25F) vision is TERRIBLE. I’m a -8.50. I have an extensive familial history of poor eyesight and bad retinas. I recently got a job at an ophthalmologist clinic so I became more aware of how poor my vision actually is. I took the initiative to make an appointment with one of our best Lasik physicians. He told me that I am a good candidate but I have severe dry eye and put me on Restasis twice daily. He then mentioned that he would be happy to reconsider scheduling my surgery after 6 to 8 weeks of using the prescription eye lubricator, Restasis. I was also told to stop wearing contacts the entire 6-8 weeks. I have been wearing them for 12 hours daily prior to this and was wearing them minutes before my appointment. 

Today, I went to go get another professional lasik consultation with another clinic one week after my no contact use and Restasis use. They  told me that they saw no evidence of corneal swelling or dry eye. They scheduled my pre-op for next week. And they even scheduled my surgery date for the end of this month. 

I guess my question is is why there’s  such a substantial difference in medical opinion and what you guys think I should do. 

Also, how bad would it be if I wore my contacts for a few hours before my pre-op visit for an event? Would it really affect the measurements for the actual surgery? I’m terrified that they correct me to a wrong vision because my contact use alters my corneal shape and I’m stuck with the wrong vision forever. 

All in all, both agreed however that I am a good candidate based on their imaging.

Yesterday at basketball practice, I got hit in my eye area with a teammate's elbow which resulted in immediate swelling and double vision due to said swelling. Post practice, I tried to blow my nose, which immediately caused the swelling to increase, to the point where I had to kinda push the air back with my hand. By the time I went to bed (\~2 hours after the hit) the double vision was practically gone and you guys can find a picture of the current state (15 hours after the hit) linked in this post.

I currently have no pain, very little swelling and a clear vision though I am worried as I've read online that the swelling after blowing your nose usually happens with socket fractures. Seeing as though the swelling decreased quickly, I have clear vision and feel no pain, should I be worried about anything? Thanks for your help!

f45ksv,Looking to see an ophthalmologist for eye/nerve issue,"Hi everyone, long story short, I had my first panic attack early last year and developed a sort of one-sided (left) head tension and eye strain afterward. At a doc appointment not too long after, the doc checked my eyes and noticed my left eye responded slower to light than compared to my right eye. He also scheduled an MRI for me and the results showed that I was fine. At a neurologist visit some months after, they didn't notice any differences in my eyes.

Problem is, after a number of doc appointments, no one seemed to know the cause and why it still persists months after. The only thing that has slightly worked to mask the pain is Naproxen.

The tension is constant. I don't feel it if I'm really occupied on something, but it is always there and can feel tense to pins and needles and it definitely ""moves"" when my eye moves - which is why I feel it is a nerve issue. Pressing the side of my eye relieves the tension, but I can't press the side of my eyes all day long.

What should I ask or I expect from a visit to the ophthalmologist concerning this? Curious to know if anyone out there suffers/had suffered similarly and how I can make the best out of my future visit to an ophthalmologist!

f48d00,Is removing a scleral buckle after 4 years reasonably safe? (I also had a vitrectomy gas bubble),"About 4 years ago I had a retina detachment. I was first given a scleral buckle surgery.  About a month later I was given a second surgery with a vitrectomy/gas bubble. 

This fixed the detachment just fine, but after 4 years I still have some discomfort from the scleral buckle. I still feel it there. I was told this feeling would go away but it hasn't.

I've searched the web and found that vitrectomies (w gas bubble) seem to be the gold standard for retinal detachment.  There's also quite a few articles out there on scleral buckle removal and even some youtube videos.

I have already made an appointment with the office that did my surgery years ago to look at it. But I also wanted to ask here; Is it reasonably safe to remove a scleral buckle?

Is the buckle even needed considering I also had a vitrectomy gas bubble?",1,14,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/f48d00/is_removing_a_scleral_buckle_after_4_years/"")",2020-02-15 03:43:24,

f4agj4,"Does the ""Tecnis Eyhance"" IOL come with caveats compared to a regular monofocal? Any experiences?","Facing cataract surgery and am considering the Tecnis Eyhance as it promises the same far vision quality of a regular monofocal IOL but with an extended intermediate range of focus. As there is no such thing as a free lunch, I suspect that it's not just *better* but just *different* with certain tradeoffs. Does anyone have experience with that IOL and could tell me if it will behave worse than a regular monofocal under some conditions and to what degree?

I have Retinitis Pigmentosa (retinal degeneration with not much field of vision left) and basically depend on getting as much light transmitted as possible, so am worried that the Eyhance would improve range of focus but overall give me a worse image quality - but the prospect of better uncorrected range of focus does sound promising enough to at least consider it strongly.

[Studies](https://www.escrs.org/paris2019/programme/posters-details.asp?id=33587) and [articles](https://www.eurotimes.org/monofocal-innovation-johnsonjohnson/) claim that this lens is ""an innovation"" and ""provided similar distance vision quality with a significant improvement in intermediate visual acuity"", but those are either sponsored by Johnson&amp;Johnson or written by their paid advisers, so to be taken with a pinch of salt.

Anyone experiences would be much appreciated.

*Form the study linked above:*

&gt;***Results:*** *Manifest refraction was similar between the IOLs. The mean binocular BCDVA for the Eyhance IOL (-0.06 LogMAR) was noninferior (within 0.1 LogMAR) to the ZCB00 IOL (-0.10 LogMAR).

The mean binocular BCDVA under mesopic conditions was statistically similar for the Eyhance (0.436 LogMAR) and the ZCB00 IOL (0.432 LogMAR).

I'm a female in my mid-twenties with no known long-term health issues and on no regular medication. I wear glasses, and occasionally I wear contact lenses; I don't tend to have a problem with comfort with contact lenses. I've lived in the UK all my life. I've been to New Zealand twice; once very recently, and once two years ago. On both occasions, on a number of days my eyes have become red, dry and very uncomfortable with an element of sensitivity to light, and I'm really struggling to work out what might be causing it. I originally attributed it mostly to not wearing sunglasses enough in bright light conditions, but having worn them as though my life depended it on my second visit (prescription polaroid sunglasses from an opticians), I started to doubt this. I also wondered if it could be related to dust, but I didn't have a problem at all on the day when we went for a 20km bike ride including a section by a quarry. Something whilst kayaking seemed to trigger it, as did something whilst rafting. I don't believe I've ever experienced anything similar in the UK or in any other country I've travelled to (all within Europe).

My ophthalmologist saw nothing wrong and recommended Visine and other vasoconstricting drops (which I know to avoid).


I had my eye checked with an optometrist who said it was dry eyes. He recommended artificial tears, warm compresses, blinking exercises, staying hydrated, and Omega-3 supplements. I followed all his instructions for almost half a year, but didn't see significant improvements.


Lastly, I saw a retinal specialist who told me that it was dry eye that was a result of the surgery. I'm not too clear on the nature of the operation but something about the incisions made makes it much more likely for the eye to get irritated. He told me to rest my eyes for 3-4 minutes throughout the day, which did not yield any significant improvements either.


Currently, it's difficult for me to go out at night because my left eye can be completely blood red, especially past midnight. When I was interning last summer, I had to rely on Lumify for days where I had presentations or other similar situations.

fa8zwv,I had Ptosis surgery to correct a droop from Horner's Syndrome - I have a question about eyelid creases,"I have acquired Horner's Syndrome approximately 4-5 years ago from a lesion to a nerve in my neck which resulted in the usual symptoms - most importantly for me was to have the Ptosis corrected to regain some symmetry.

The surgery went fantastically well (it was done 14\~ months ago) and I have achieved significant improvement in symmetry - my only issue that I have now is that it seems that whilst I was effected by Ptosis it caused my eyelid to develop a couple of different creases. When my eyelid folds along on the 'right' crease my eyes look bang on perfect and when folding slightly higher and not meeting all the way to the edge of my eyelid it looks very uneven &amp; almost puffy. 

My question is, is there a reliable way that I can help it define along one normal crease line? Will it over time 'correct' itself now that I have had and recovered from the Ptosis surgery, will it just be a matter of time for my eye to get used to folding along the 'right' crease?

I’m kinda stressed with this for future as he said more holes can come or not... depends.. but he said if they do they just laser them and that’s it. My question is that I’m really stressed about this... he said I’m nearsighted so as per this happening but no optometrist ever told me that... hoping no holes ever appear again, but he said to yearly do a checkup...

Last Tuesday, I had a Posterior capsule opacification in one of my eyes.  Which, according to my doctor, was to help with minor cloudy vision after my cataract surgery last year.



The procedure was quick and painless, however I now have this opaque spot that comes and goes as I move my eye.  


It doesn't affect my entire field of vision, it's just a hazy spot that seems to float around as I'm moving my eyes throughout the day.  It fact it's like a floater in the way that it moves, but it's not a floater because I've had one in my other eye for years and this one just appeared after the procedure last Tuesday. Plus this one isn't dark, it's like a cloudy or opaque mass.


I don't feel anything, I just see it appear in my field of vision, then disappear.


I messaged my doctor, and he said this is normal in some patients and that it will eventually fall out of my field of vision.


So I'm just wondering, what could this thing be?  Has anyone ever heard of something like this?

fb04m1,New astigmatism rx blurs if I tilt my head left,"I ordered some frames and lenses online after getting a new prescription from my eye doctor, and I've been having some problems when I tilt my head. 

Specifically, if I tilt my head (or glasses) even slightly to the left, my glasses blur, and stays blurry as it tilt and hold postion. However, if I tilt my head back right by any amount, my vision clears up again. 

Like for example, let's say I tilt my head left by 20 degrees, my vision blurs up, but then from that position I tilt it right by 5 degrees (so 15 degrees to the left of center), my vision clears up. 

If I tilt my head to the right, my vision is clear regardless of the degree.

For some background, doc told me my astigmatism rx went up by about a half diopter in each eye (od 2.75 axis 180 and os 3.5 axis 5 now (no word about my axis changing)), and was very dismissive when I asked for my pd (she said something to the effect of ""I don't know, like 62.5""), so I just put 63 on the website I ordered from. Not sure if either of those things would contribute, but doesn't hurt to include.

I also ordered a second pair at the same time with the same rx, and it has the same tilt problem.

Is this just something that happens with astigmatism, or is there some sort of error/defect with my rx/lenses? I don't remember ever having this problem before.

Ended up having monthly avastin injections for 7 months followed by on more 3 months after last injection. 

Fast forward to today after nearly a year of no injections. Sudden onset of one old spot and one larger spot on opposite side central visual area. Another fluorescent dye scan confirming a new area of leakage. 

Doctor mentioned that the CSR is a byproduct of abnormal vascular growth and not the actual issue. Another round of avastin injections scheduled. When I asked about things I can do to prevent future onset or to speed recovery I was told there wasn’t really anything else besides the injections.

A couple studies I have read mention finasteride and eplerenone as effective in preventing additional onset and helping reduce existing leakage.  The Dr said since the CSR leakage is a byproduct of the vascular growth that only the avastin would work.

fcijil,Help Understanding 1 Year Old’s Vision Screening Results,"So at my youngest child’s 12 month pediatric check up, they did the infrared spot exam screening. When the doctor entered the room, he immediately asked me if visual impairments run in our family. I wear glasses for astigmatism and nearsightedness, my husband has great vision and doesn’t need glasses. The screening picked up anisocoria, anisometropia, and hyperopia all in the left eye. I had been telling the pediatrician since my baby was 3 months old that his pupils were different sizes, and each time he replied with “I don’t see it; it’s nothing to worry about.” 

We have a scheduled appointment with an ophthalmologist in two months.

What I don’t understand (and cannot find with many hours googling) is if these impairments are all related? Is my child’s brain able to use that eye or is it ignoring all visual input from it? Would these conditions cause impaired depth perception? 

Also, are the pediatric spot exam results adjusted to his age? I know that babies are farsighted, but the test indicated he was abnormally farsighted. Does this mean he’s abnormally farsighted for a one year old, or is it compared to normal adult vision? 

Obviously, we are curious as to what our baby can and cannot see and the extent of the impairment to his vision, but I’m unable to find much information regarding patients his age.

New symptoms now include in flickering my eyes when I wake up, dull vision in one eye compared to the other and just yesterday I looked up at the sky and saw hundreds of bright white flashing lights. Since then my focus and double vision has been worse. 

I have been suffering from this for since last August and I am at my wits end. 

My eye exams are fine with nothing wrong at the front of the eye. My retina and the internals of the front of my eye were perfect before and are perfect again as of a re-rest of last week. My glasses are up to date. I have had blood tests for many different things including diabetes and myasthenia gravis. I have had an MRI and a CT scans with nothing untoward showing. 

A consultant opthamologist told me that im having ocular migraines which based on the symptoms I am but it is my instinct that this cannot be the only issue at play. This is because I have this issue 24/7 which is unfitting with the concept of an ocular migraine. I have an uptick of floaters and visual disturbances. When looking into a light i  source i see a constant waterfall pattern of colorless dots. 

I have also had swollen eyelids intermittently since August and was diagnosed with blepharitis. This has since been treated yet my visual symptoms persist.

fdwuv8,Upcoming Cataract Surgery - Mini Monovision?,"I'm about a month out from cataract surgery (having to wait due to the fact that I've been in RGP contacts for about 2 years now).

I'm 55 and was sporting about -7 \~ -8 in each eye before the cataracts started.  Right eye is dominate and has very little astigmatism.  Left eye has a bit more.  Don't have the numbers in front of me but the ophthalmologists characterized it as ""some astigmatism, but not bad"". 

Looks to me that multifocal lenses aren't quite there yet, too many compromises and uncertainties.  So, I'm thinking just regular monofocal lenses.  However, I'd like as much spectacle independence as I can get, though I understand it will never be complete independence.  Basically, I'd like to be able to see my iPhone 7+ (decent sized screen) without putting on readers and hopefully see a computer screen ok at 18 \~ 20 inches.

I'm thinking mini monovision and I'd like to get several ophthalmologist's opinion on that and how much difference between the two eyes.  I'm sort of thinking 1 diopter under corrected in the left non-dominate eye.  Opinions?   I've actually walked around wearing glasses for a year or so that was undercorrected 1.5(ish) diopters in that eye as revealed by a new refraction and had no issue with it.  

I've never had tack sharp vision since I was a kid.  I can't remember the last time they could correct me to anything better than 20/25 and I've been walking around for 4 years much worse than that due to the cataracts.  So my expectations are not astronomically high.

I couldn't walk without getting a headache for 2 weeks. I'm finally back to my normal self aside from my floaters. I noticed them when I went outside for the first time after hitting my head. I believe they've gotten worse since I first hit my head. I can't tell if they're getting worse or they're consistently the same now.

I see them constantly when I'm outside, looking up at the sky, looking at the sidewalk, or looking at a blank wall. There's usually a blurry black spot that bounces around for a few seconds and then disappears whenever I move my eyes. I also usually see a cluster of clear squiggly lines that appears to be ""falling"" every time I look down. I was thinking it was maybe visual snow?

I went to the optometrist at VisionWorks a few weeks ago and he said everything looked fine. No retinal tears or anything. I'm still paranoid and it's driving me nuts.

How relevant is Negative Spherical Aberration (-.27um) of a Tecnis IOL?

Initially, I was to receive an AcrySof Toric in one eye (R) and an Alcon Clareon in the other (L) but it was reconsidered in favor of a non-tinted and glistening-free Tecnis Toric (ZCT150) in the right eye and in order to match tint in the other, a non-Toric Tecnis in the left eye.

I haven't been made aware of the differences between an IOL with neutral (Clareon) and one with negative aberration (the non-Toric Tecnis) or how that could impact me. I'm not sure what to expect from that negative spherical aberration of that IOL. Is this a trivial difference or one that could affect the outcome significantly?

It's been a month and a half and I had some initial side effects that went away (dry eyes, double vision around streetlights and such at night), however I've had other side effects which come and go and have persisted and are such that at times I can't do my job and sometimes can't even use my computer since I literally can't read the words on the screen.  I saw the retina dr who performed the surgery and was told that the surgery seemed to have healed fine, but when I asked about the side effects was dismissed very abruptly without any further exam or questions.

I'm going to see an ophthalmology specialist to see what's going on and what can be done, but here are some of the symptoms, just hoping someone might have input/experience with this and hoping that these are temporary or can be fixed somehow if they're not.

Side effects: light sensitivity (varies, sometimes very painful, sometimes just annoying), monocular double vision/ghost images above/below things in both eyes that comes and goes (can't detect any patterns, sometimes it's in the morning, sometimes just out of the blue, sometimes at night... I thought it was eye tiredness but doesn't seem to be the case.  It gets so bad that I literally can't read the computer code or other text on my computer, which is bad since my work revolves around programming and computer use and working on applying for better jobs that are still focused on that), fuzzy/blurry vision periodically in one or both eyes (really fun when one of my eyes is doing the double vision thing and the other is fuzzy and/or has its own double vision thing going on), seemingly blind spots in the center and a few other areas in one eye (I have to move the eye around to read the text/see what's that's in those spots), dry eyes much more frequently than normal, and problems changing distance (if I'm looking at something close it takes an actual conscious effort to change distance to focus on and look at something further away, and vice versa).

Needless to say these are very disconcerting and I wasn't having any of these prior to the laser photocoagulation, and all the issues were this was supposed to take care of and prevent a possible future retinal tear or detachment were asymptomatic before the surgery.  Not asking for a diagnosis or medical advice, just personal advice or personal experiences.  I'll update after I see the ophthalmologist specialist - though that might be a few weeks or month away.

* If I go for a run in the afternoon, it does not seem to occur.

The symptoms are as follows:

Two circular white spots in central vision next to each other, each the size of a coin, with what seems to be a border radiating outwards slightly from them quickly in rapid succession. My vision does not seem to blur, I have no pain.

The phenomenon seems to disappear once I am cool. I have tried replicating this phenomenon in the evening with a hot shower but cannot seem to do so. Again, if I go for a run in the afternoon, it does not seem to occur also.

Looking for some help and advice on what to do next, because I’m freaking out.   
 

I’m a 35 year old female, no known underlying health conditions. Astigmatism in both eyes, right eye highly myopic and the left around a -4.25. Suffered with migraine with brain stem aura since childhood. Have always had some floaters and odd flashes too. Mother and aunt with MS and family history of diabetes but I’m not a sufferer to my knowledge.   
 

For the past three weeks I’ve been seeing a bright crooked line in my left eye on the nose side of my central vision whenever I look side to side, it only appears on bright/white backgrounds and outside etc. No pain, redness. No headaches or anything like that. So far no real noticeable increase in floaters or shadows, or flashing lights, or anything like that.   


The line appears to blend in to whatever coloured background it's on, so if I look at a red screen it looks slightly lighter red, if I look at a blue screen, it's slightly lighter blue etc.   
It’s slightly changed shape since I first noticed it on the morning on Feb 17th and I’ll attach an image I cooked up that shows the “evolution” of this thing.  

I went to the optician who performed an OCT scan, retinal photography, tonometry and had a look in my eyes with an ophthalmoscope. Said all looked fine, but referred me to the specialist ophthalmology unit at a local hospital just to be on the safe side because my left eye is my only “good eye”.   
 

By the end of that week, I was checked out by a doctor (a consultant in ophthalmology) who did a dilated eye exam, and was very thorough. He said my eyes looked healthy and my vitreous motility was good and that he expected the line I’ve been seeing was some kind of floater associated with normal changes in the vitreous.   
 

I hoped he was right, but over the last three or four days things have got worse.    
 

On Thursday I went to the opticians for a sight test. Slight increase in strength as it has been three years since my last sight test, and my astigmatism went from -0.50 CYL/115.0 AXI to -1.0 CLY/110.0 AXIS. I had another OCT scan and a retinal image again.   
 

The optician showed me the scans and assured me that there didn’t appear to be any signs of macular degeneration or anything that suggested my eyes were less than healthy. I wish I could have been reassured but I’m not.   
 

Since Friday the “bright line” that only appeared when I look side to side, now appears to have a small patch of colour attached to/near it which I am seeing more and more, especially when blinking.   
 

The patch appears without the line and appears to possibly be based in the darker area on the third/most recent image in the diagram below. 

  
 

[ \(It's on a grey background to illustrate the brightness of the line, but generally the line blends with the background colour just looks slightly lighter\)](https://preview.redd.it/m4dzpeddwpl41.png?width=774&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f0ed0720d0602199c8fcee2dffab56535e8d7cf)

The colour patch also appears blue/green when trying to focus on dark backgrounds, and it almost seems like it gets “charged up” by looking at a bright screen and then looking away to a black curtain for example, the patch is more prominent and it appears on all colour backgrounds, but doesn’t seem to be visible in low light/the dark.   
 

Both the line and the patch look bigger when I’m focusing on something far away, and smaller when focusing close up too. The line and the patch do not move at all, they are completely static and do not float across my vision in anyway.   
 

I can’t explain what I’m seeing any better than that. I’m absolutely scared to death. I haven’t eaten properly in almost two weeks, I can barely sleep and I am in a constant state of anxiety and panic about what could be going on. My heart is constantly beating out of my chest and I’m suffering constant waves of nausea worrying about what this could be and if it will get worse/take my sight.   
 

Like I said, the specialist doctor and two opticians have told me (as of 107 hours ago) that my eyes appear healthy, but clearly there is something wrong here because I shouldn’t be seeing this kind of thing and I never had prior to Feb 17th.   
 

Does anyone have any idea what this could be?  
 

Are there any other tests I could insist on having that might actually give me an definitive explanation for what’s going on?   
 

Is there any way to categorically rule out anything sinister?  
 

Could what I’m experiencing be down to my astigmatism?  
 

I’m going to the hospital to be seen again tomorrow, I’m terrified but I hope in the meantime someone here might be able to offer a suggestion of what all this could be and what questions/tests I could push for with the doctors.

* **Extended Depth of Focus** lenses.

Well I didn’t know it was going to get this bad initially so I decided to wait it out and see if it goes away by itself. It didn’t and got worse.

Finally after 2 weeks I went to my first Ophthalmologist and I couldn’t even read anything from pinhole test. I was diagnosed with adenoviral conjunctivitis and keratitis. They noticed some membranes and immediately took them off from both eyes. Then I was prescribed prednisolone acetate ( 3 drops daily in both eyes for 2 weeks ). The drops definitely helped me and my vision was 50% back but not fully. Then was instructed to taper down in the next 2 weeks. End of January and I was off prednisolone and I could see better.

2 weeks later ( mid February ) I started noticing blurry vision again, so I scheduled another appointment. Turned out some of the cornea inflammation came back but it was not in the center so vision was still decent ( left eye had more spots on the cornea compared to right ). This time I was only diagnosed with keratitis and was told to start another round of prednisolone ( 2 drops daily for 2 weeks and then 1 drop daily for another 2 weeks ). So far I noticed vision improves as I am using the eye drops.

Questions I have are; how long does keratitis usually last for after conjunctivitis? What are the chances of keratitis(cornea inflammation) to reoccur again? Are there any other treatments/things that can help eliminate keratitis, I should ask my eye doctor about?",1,13,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/fh5u0a/bilateral_acute_adenoviral_follicular/"")",2020-03-11 15:37:08,

fhlogl,Darkening in one eye,"I have a strange problem with my vision that I'm hoping somebody might have some ideas about.  I have three symptoms that may or may not be related, but hopefully they're helpful information:

1) My left eye will (sometimes gradually, sometimes quite rapidly) fill in black when I'm looking at something.  It doesn't seem to be Troxler's effect from what I can tell (and, actually, those Troxler's effect images don't even work with this eye, more on that below).  On extremely high-contrast situations, it's sometimes almost immediate (for example, on a vision test where they show the black text on white backgrounds, it's very difficult for me to read these because they turn black so quickly).  Looking away momentarily will help a little, and moving my eyes helps, but the longer I'm trying to look at something that involves little eye movement, the worse it gets and the more quickly this happens.  When I'm walking around or doing something that provides a large amount of motion in my vision, it doesn't seem to really much happen at all.  Looking at something like an Amsler's grid will create a nice, dark tunnel around the center point, and then shortly after even the center point disappears momentarily, moves a little bit and I can see it again for a split second, and then disappears again.

2) My left eye is also weird in other ways.  Annoyingly so.  Closing my right eye and trying to use it for pretty much anything is very frustrating.  When I try to walk around, the world feels weird.  I can't really put my finger on it.  It just looks.. wrong.  When trying to read, I get double vision, my entire field of vision seems to move around in annoying ways.  If I keep my eye moving quickly I can mostly read it with, but everything seems to float around and different parts of my vision don't really appear to move correctly with respect to other parts of my field of vision.  If I don't move my eye enough, my eye appears to lose focus mysteriously and what i'm looking at moves inward, and consciously trying to re-focus on it will snap it back into place and it will stay in focus for a very short time before again doing this.  If I video record my eye, I see it moving a little bit away from what I was looking at and then moving back into place.  It kind of jitters a little.

3) With both eyes open, things aren't quite so bad, which is why I generally don't care about the other two problems.  But, those problems it does cause seem to be getting worse over time.  Only real problem is things will kind of look out-of-focus, generally when doing something like reading.  Sometimes I'll see double.  Looking at something like graph paper is the worst.  Recording my eyes when this happens shows my left pupil just kind of slowly drifts inward a little bit.  If I put effort into trying to focus the image, I get a clear image momentarily (and my left eye then snaps back into place), but it again drifts apart and the image becomes less clear again.  And doing that hurts, which is one of the reasons I'm starting to care about it at a bit more.

Optically, my eyes are fine.  Very good, stable vision.  No detected problems with any of the main components of my eyes in so far as would be detected during a normal eye exam.  When I mentioned this to my optometrist, he had no idea, thought it sounded really weird, and referred me to a neuro-ophthalmologist.  It's going to take forever to get an appointment, though, so I'm curious if anybody has any ideas of what might be going on.

Recently it had been getting better and I didn’t have any symptoms, but suddenly I got what I thought was conjunctivitis (sore, red irritated eyes) 6 months ago, and used chloramphenicol eye ointment (they’re available over the counter here in the UK) and it went away within 5 days. However it came back within a couple of weeks and got so bad (sore and red) that I went to the A&amp;E. They told me it was conjunctivitis and I should use chloramphenicol again and it went away within a week. It came back gradually over a couple of weeks and I saw my GP who didn’t know what it was and referred me to a specialist, but that appointment is in 3 months. She told me to try chloramphenicol again, and I used it for 3 weeks (it took longer to clear up each time) and then I stopped using it. Again, it came back. During this time, after researching I realised that it was most likely blepharitis caused by staph bacteria, for which ophthalmology sites say to use topical antibiotics for 6-8 weeks. I started using chloramphenicol again but after 2 weeks there has been little to no improvement whereas previously within a couple of days the symptoms would clear up. I think I have become resistant to chloramphenicol as a result of overuse. I saw my GP to ask for Fusidic Acid eye drops (an alternative to chloramphenicol but on prescription only) but she was hesitant to prescribe antibiotics and instead told me to use hot compresses (which I have tried exhaustingly without results, and have been doing consistently before my infection started in order to manage my blepharitis).

BACKGROUND INFO: I have been wearing contacts for 4ish years. I tried them a bit in high school but had issues with them folding &amp; going up into my eye (which I know now is because I wasn’t wearing astigmatisms lenses lol). I stepped away from them until I could afford them myself. You see I have an astigmatism in both eyes, and have found that Acuvue Oayases (sp) Astigmatism lenses worked the best for me.. the first whole 2.5 years I had my contacts I wasn’t responsible.. I wore them for months on end. Never took them out. Used the same pair for months without putting new lenses in. Like stupidity! I HAVE CHANGED MY WAYS NOW! For a bit I was having constant issues with what I assumed was a reoccurring stye or the other ones that start with a “C”and bought OTC treatment and successfully cleared them up(2 and a half years ago). After treating the eye issue 3 times in a row, I decided to grow up and I now take my contacts out every night and usually only wear them when I work.. 3-5 days a week worn for no longer than 5-8 hours on average. I am currently using an old pair that is missing a small chunk out of the edge (I KNOW! Bad bad bad, but I’ve been so depressed &amp; haven’t wanted to even wear my contacts lately and my glasses have a huge crack in them.. I’m not gonna wear them in public! So I have been just going kinda blind, I don’t drive far) and because of this I have been wearing my contacts as little as possible and alternate them with some dailies that actually is my roommates. She gave me a new one of hers to see if it’ll work.. it does but not the best.. I’m going to call and make an appointment with my primary eye doctor on Monday regardless of any advice I am given here.. 

Okay skip to CURRENT: 
I have always noticed my eyes feel a little weird after I take my contacts out.. my left one is usually always fine after a bit and the right would take a little longer. It feels like there’s something in my eye.. my doctor said this is normal and takes a bit for your eye to get “used” to not having the contact in anymore. But the right one is still acting weird. It is also the one that the ripped one goes in.. could that missing chunk be stuck under my top lid somewhere even if this happened 2ish months ago (noticed the piece missing while putting my contacts in the next day) &amp; if the answer is no or unlikely, then I think I compromised my right eye’s health by using my contacts irresponsibly.. &amp; you should keep reading.. tell me honestly.. how screwed could I be?

SYMPTOMS:
I should add I’m a 27 year old female. Don’t know if weight or height matter, if they do I’ll add it! 

Feels like something is stuck in right eye after contact removal. (Seems to always be “stuck” in the same general area of my R eye every single time)

Drops made for contact irritation don’t work nor does solution or anything else I’ve tried. 

I have stringy eye gunk towards the end of my shift &amp; after about 5 hours of lens wear. It is usually clear or a little bit of milky tint and it never smells odd, but is very sticky. 

My eye has often been gunked up in the morning. Has been stuck shut 2 times since symptoms started. 

Very very rarely I get a sudden very painful achy feeling like my eyeball is bruised when I rub my eye &amp; the tenderness lasts about 15-20 mins after (could be cause I rub it too hard, but I always rub it hard it usually feels good)

Despite all this my eyes don’t seem any more irritated or dry (always a bit dry) than they usually are and my left eye seems to be completely fine.. they don’t look cloudy or discolored to me..?

I’m super afraid that my eye is all messed up and I can’t even feel sorry for myself when it was my own VERY stupid fault. &amp; I will be making an appointment on Monday to have it looked at because I didn’t realize that this could be bad until I read an article about irresponsible contact lenses in a magazine today...

And here I am 1 month later, 1 family doctor visit and 2  Ophthalmologist apps. 

My optometrist recommended me to a local Ophthalmologist, long story short. I waited a week or two (very eagerly), and finally saw the specialist. Yay. I thought I was going to get my eyes fixed soon and be ready for college classes in the summer. Wrong. he denied me treatment due to my eczema. That day I honestly lost a lot of hope, because I was (still am) blind in one eye (no vision but there's light and shadows). I just really thought I was doomed for treatment and I'll be stuck like this. 

A week later, I see my family doctor to ask for a referral to another specialist that my grandfather saw. This specialist is highly qualified, recommended, etc. etc. And I stress the importance of getting a consultation with this clinic. For the entire month of february, I was twiddling my thumbs waiting for a call or an appointment. I got nothing, and out of nowhere scared myself into thinking I was going to go blind. It scared me into calling the clinic myself and booking an appointment and wow, much surprise but I got my own appointment.

I didn't really know what to expect, I thought that due to the referral of a doctor it speeds up the consultation date. 

Anyway, my appointment was on March 9 and huzzah.. I am thoroughly examined and we had a proper conversation about my condition. Some things I learned at this appointment:

* I am able to get surgery (She didn't comment on my skin or that I had eczema in my childhood) so thank the lord that worry is gone!
* My right eye (the cataract) is very advanced, she said she couldn't believe it developed that quickly.
* My left eye is actually developing into cataract as well. Beginning to, and sadly I am seeing cloudiness and blurry vision.
* Laser cataract surgery is **expensive**.... like jesus. I think the cheapest option was 7k. 
* She said that due to my young age, she will expedite a surgery date because she believes by September (she is just scheduling surgeries for that month now) I will lose all vision
* Due to the coronavirus, patients are cancelling appointments. So I want to say that its good for me? I really don't know, but hey if I get a surgery date earlier the better. 

So in conclusion, I'm waiting for my next appointment to discuss with the surgeon and his thoughts on my scans, etc. That's at the end of march.

Now some scary things I need to get off my chest. 

Recently, I've fallen into a bit of a depression. I am scared. I am helplessly scared. I can't see most of the time, and my left eye is getting worse. It's hard to stay positive at a time like this. Like honestly, this is such a horrible situation, I'm in my 20s and I'm supposed to be at college right now and working, and all these things I was doing before. It's just so hard right now, mentally. I'm scared to wake up one day with no vision at all and at that point, what then. 

BUT. 

I'm holding on, because I got a lot of life to experience still and I can't let this get me down. Rant over.

fjm6yf,Worried about Acanthamoeba keratitis after coming into contact with Tilapia water at wet market,"Hi All,

TLDR: Got splashed with water in a container full of live Tilapia. Googled possible damage. Now worried I have AK. Want to hear your experiences and looking for some consolation.

Part of me is writing this to vent my anxiety. Another part wants information from anyone who is willing to share their experience with Acanthamoeba keratitis.

I'm in the Philippines and over here there are wet markets where they sell live tilapia in deep circular trays filled with water. This morning I accidentally got splashed with this water and a droplet made it into my eye. I didn't have the chance to flush it out since I was in a busy market with no access to a reliable tap. I forgot all about it until this afternoon when my eye started to itch. The bottom half was red. I then dropped some artificial tears into my eye. It's better now, not itchy and less red. But I'm still unbelievably worried. Should I be though?

Some info I'm not sure is important: I wear glasses. I've worn contact lenses before but I stopped using them regularly for nearly 6 years now. The last occasion I had to wear contacts was 4 months ago. I had a little cry a few hours before my eye started to itch (movie). Now I'm wondering if I should get an opthalmologist to get a corneal stain to check for the amoeba.

If you've read this far, thank you for your patience. If you have/had AK, please share your story. I hope you're staying safe as we weather this COVID19.

Sincerely,

I’m 18 and I need your advice. In 7th grade, I transferred to another school which required me to use my laptop almost every day, for 4-5 hours, and by the end of the year, it resulted in my eyesight going from 20/20 to -0.75 (RE) and -1 (LE), then, by the end of the 8th grade, it became -2 in both eyes, -3.5 in 9th grade, -4.5 in 10th and -6 in 11th grade. A year later, which is at the moment, it’s -7.5 or even 8, or even 8.5. When I was 16, I was told that my retina is very thin, and there might be a chance for retinal detachment to happen, and I can’t prevent it, because my organism is growing and developing, and it will continue as such until I am 22-23. They told me to consider undergoing retinal thickening surgery (idk the proper name, as English is not my first language), but I heard that it leaves the eye surface scarred and also that I won’t be able to do LASIK to fix my eyesight. I’m absolutely lost, bc I also am a woman, and I want to have kids, and how is my eyesight going to survive during the birth process... I also am passionate about tennis, and if I undergo such surgeries, I guess I might have to leave out such meaningful part of my life, just as I did it with programming.

fjrrlf,Glaucoma suspect. Help pls,"Hi guys!!

I was just at the doctor today for an eye check up
My IOP is Normal. 
He did tonometry (non dilated) and looked at my optic nerve. He saw something with my optic nerves that raised a red flag 🚩 for glaucoma. He then asked me to do more tests. 
One was the peripheral vision test and the other one was a machine that took a picture of my optic nerves. 
Both test results were good. I have to come back for dilated test next week. 

Can I possibly have glaucoma just based on what he saw on the tonometry test?
Or once I pass the peripheral vision test and my optic nerves pictures look normal, can one still he diagnosed with glaucoma?

I should go to a doctor, but my area affected with covid-19, and my only option is go to the large clinic where all sick people gathering. I understand that eye diagnosis is all about ophthalmoscopy and other examinations, but i maybe overlooked description of some non threatening disease like white spots syndrome.

I'm 28, male, have non-progressing -9D myopia and no significant retina complications last time i checked. Doctor even said that my axial eye length not that bad and probably i don't get any severe pathological myopia complications for a lifetime. He said i must check in a three years period.

About two weeks ago my workspace lighting conditions changed, i changed  glasses from kind of side-covered to old ones with opened sides, thin metal rims (same diopters), and i noticed large semi-transparent scotomas in both eyes.

It's much more to the periphery then i depicted, border of the affected area goes thicker when i squint, flashes when eye moves or blink. It doesn't glow in dark or after i close eyes. Looks like in a light conditions i used to brain can effectively hide this things.

I can't say for sure is it more cracks or borders of a damaged area. But i definitely can see through this. I tryed to find really blind spots around there with small objects and lights, or long strait things like rulers. No visual disturbances, no blurriness, no wavy lines it's just like on top of everything or even blends completely and not visible when i focus on object i see. And it's probably roughly match lens coverage of previous glasses, and right eye thing has bump in it's shape where visible part of nose located. I had no enormous sunlight or welding arcs exposure though.

Also i think i had some sort of repetitive anomaly light post image like things in that place in left eye years ago. Certainly no progress for two weeks, no other symptoms like flashes or floaters. Chances are this things are few years old and i just noticed.

fk8not,What do floaters look like from the ophthalmologist's POV?,"Not a ""triage"" question, but i saw that /r/Ophthalmology is not for patient questions and the FAQ directed me here. 

  
Some background: I'm myopic and had a retinal detachment in my 20's that was repaired via a scleral buckle in one eye. In my other eye, a hole developed in my retina but I caught it early due to a burst of new floaters and they were able to repair that eye with what I think of as ""the laser cannon"" (never been more nervous about not moving my eye in my life, I have to say). Anyway, point being: I have a *lot* of floaters. Not just the little bits, but big clusters of ""cobwebs"" that float around. 

From what I understand, when I perceive the floaters in my vision, a lot of what I'm seeing is the shadow they cause on my retina, is that right? I was at an eye exam yesterday and I got to wondering what it looked like from the eye doctor's perspective, especially when doing a deep dive retinal exam like is usually the case for me. How magnified is the image when looking through with the head mounted and other lenses? Does it look like bits of junk floating around in the vitreous or does the image of the retina just get distorted or what?

Anyway, sorry for the unimportant question, just something I've been curious about for years. I tried searching for images online but I couldn't find anything, all the images I found were approximations of what floaters look like to ME. And frankly, I know all too well what they look like given I have eyes that feel like snowglobes sometimes. :)",1,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/fk8not/what_do_floaters_look_like_from_the/"")",2020-03-17 09:56:12,

fkfxkw,First time getting dilated ... questions about how it was done.,"So I went to get an eye exam done and I was not really put at ease by the whole process.  The eye tech/nurse (before I even saw the doctor) put numbing drops (one drop in each eye) and then dilating drops (one drop in each eye).  

On neither of the drops did the tech say to press down on the inner corner of my eye with the tear duct to keep the drops from running into my throat and hence ingesting some.  I was told by others after the fact and looking up on the internet that the standard procedure is to push down on the inner corner to block the tear duct for a minute or two.

What is indeed the procedure for these drops and should I be worried that I didn't block the tear duct during either the numbing or the dilating drops?

I can't be sure what sort of drops exactly were used but I've read on the internet that atropine is a possible type and that this type of drop specifically can have toxicity if ingested.

Please note that I am not able to get tested where I live, and I tried twice asking my pcp. He says there aren't enough tests.

4 days later, I noticed a dramatic increase in flashes. While on the cyclosporine I only had a small and infrequent flash in my left eye. Now, that flash is brighter and I have a very large patch in the lower right corner of my right eye that flashes. They start flashing whenever I look out the bright window, turn on the light, or go outside, or sometimes after standing up quickly. When I'm outside in the daytime they flash every time I blink. They are kind of like a strobe light.

What worries me is this type of flashing is very similar to when I first got uveitis before treatment.

After a quick Google search I read that I should see a specialist asap to ensure it was not something serious.

The specialist used ultrasound to check if I had a tear and also dialated my eye and use light I look in the back. He said from ultra sound there was no sign of tear, I also did a vision test and was able to read past the 20/20 line with both eyes.

He said he noticed the pressure in both eyes while just within acceptable limits, the right eye was slightly 2 points (or what ever measurement) higher pressure than the left. As such he wants me to come back in a week. He gave me anti inflammatory eye drops, 1 drop 3 times a day and said that since I'm over 40 it could be some some of temporary stage the eye is going through and he just wants to reduce the pressure and watch.

He said he saw a very small area when looking with the light that was not orange but a little grey and that he wants to follow up to keep watching that area for any changes. But that due to 20/20 vision he was going to wait. He also took my pressure and a tested my blood sugar.

After the exam, I wasn’t given protective eyewear or given any warning about being outdoors. I took a ten minute walk home since I walked to the clinic. My glasses have progressive lenses that become somewhat dark although not as dark as regular sunglasses. I worked four hours outdoors at my job the next day. 

That night I had a headache going to bed. After closing my eyes, I had a solar eclipse effect on each eyelid like two dark circles with a white circle around them. It would be more noticeable when I blinked my eyes or moved my eyebrows up and down. 

After a few weeks, I’m still getting these effects and little red lights such as on a DVD player have a large round reddish halo around them. I’m now having difficulty reading smaller movie credits.  I had a bad headache last night and I seldom have headaches.

I called the clinic about five days afterwards and they said I should be fine. Any thoughts about this? I’m a patient.",1,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/fnjyl8/question_about_retinal_exam/"")",2020-03-23 06:28:35,

fo0q8c,Can childhood amblyopia worsen and change as an adult? Concerning new issues,"I was born with accomodative esotropia amblyopia in my left eye. I have strong lenses rather than patching, which I was told was successful. For two decades my eye would only cross-in a bit when tired, but I could correct/prevent/control it so I didn't ever anything more than transient double vision..

Now in the last year, my left eye also seems to drift outwards, and I can't control it. This is new, it's never happened before. If I focus on something with just my left eye, it drifts toward my ear and the image goes dark by my nose and in the center (kinda in a donut  tunnel vision way), but I have some peripheral vision toward my ear. I quick blink to refocus on whatever I'm looking at, which makes my vision go back to normal, but within a second the drift starts again. I don't know if the drift happens just with one eye (my left eye) open, or if it also happens with both eyes open. I only figured out it was drifting outwards because people witnessed it happening, then I was able to take videos and kinda see it myself. The refocusing sometimes makes my eye have a few quick jerks, if I strain to keep my eye open when refocusing rather than blink.

I also have binocular double vision nearly constantly now, the severity and degree to which I notice it fluctuates, and it's restricted to narrow margins near my nose and mid-peripheral (when looking at a lecture hall with both eyes open and facing center for example, a desk in the center of the room might be doubled and skewed to the left, and the blinds on a window right next to my head will also be horizontally skewed/doubled). I assume the worsened double vision is related to the eye crossing in and drifting out, but it's really hard to strain to get it to go away now.

It was my understanding that congenital amblyopia doesn't get worse, once it's successfully corrected - if this is true, what could possibly explain the new exotropia? Is it related to the esotropia, or a new and different unrelated issue?

If esotropia is caused by muscle imbalances of the eye, does development of exotropia mean my eye muscles are changing (in a pathologic nerve or muscle weakness way)?

I have a generalized undiagnosed rare neuromuscular condition, but is generally marked by nerve hyperexcitability (negative exome sequencing, secondary mitochondrial deficits, CNS and PNS issues). But no one knows if my eye stuff is related to it or not.

Doing all this left me with a question, though – in theory, how long could one press their eyes before causing permanent damage? Someone commented that the reason vision goes dark is because the optic nerve can't get enough oxygen, but the vision always comes back. Is there a point at which it wouldn't?

Two years ago, I underwent [sublative RF](https://electralaser.com/sublative-rejuvenation-faqs/) (disclaimer: link is just for reference - this is not where I went for the procedure) on my eyebrows to help remove scarring from a previous cosmetic operation. Despite wearing ocular shields during the procedure, I’ve had a lot of problems with my vision. My symptoms categorized as follows:

Immediate:

* Mild reduction in VA (prescription changed from 0 to -0.5)
* Reduced ability to see close-up
* Clicking noise and discomfort when moving eyes
* Light sensitivity
* Distinct 2-3 lines in my vision
* Slow accommodation
* Dry eye (getting worse)
* Floaters (getting worse)
* Dripping sound coming from behind my eyes when lying in bed (\~30 secs frequency) - ongoing until today

Slowly progressing:

* Difficulty seeing at night
* Halos/glare
* After image
* Blurring and reduction in peripheral vision
* Gradual loss in contrast/motion sensitivity
* Double vision only when looking at reflection in glass
* Increase in number and length of veins showing in the white of my eye

All ophthalmologists I saw can’t relate my symptoms to the incident that caused the on-set, however, I’m being followed for the following:

* De-pigmentation in my retina 
* Optic nerve cupping 
* Keratoconus
* Ocular rosacea
* Dry eye

fpcdsp,Refractive Lens Exchange versus Lasik/SMILE," 

Opthalmologists of reddit, what are your thoughts on doing a Refractive Lens Exchange surgery -- as compared to Lasik or SMILE?

My cousin has high myopia (more than 10 diopters). This has really not affected his life in any significant way. However it has always been a dream of his to live free of glasses.

A few questions:

* How good is Refractive Lens Exchange as compared to Lasik and SMILE?
* Is it true that we don't have long-term data on the benefits/dangers of SMILE?
* If they cannot run a 10 year study on SMILE, is the data really any good? In terms of indicating whether there could be complications, serious or otherwise.

As I understand, refractive lens exchange surgery is very similar to a cataract surgery. In fact, almost exactly the same.

The reason RLE makes sense here is that my cousin is a bit on the older side. He is 40+. Even if he doesn't do cataract surgery now, he will have to do it later. This cuts down the number of surgeries down from two to one. This, in my opinion, is huge. Supossing here are complications after a cataract surgery (for example, retinal detachment), then that is two surgeries. Three surgeries on a single eye seems like a lot.

This is for a cousin. My cousin is a 40+ year old male, who has 10+ diopters of power in both eyes. He has adequate corneal thickness for both Lasik and Smile.

A commenter on reddit said the following: ""For your -10.00, 40+ year-old friend, I'd think most surgeons would prefer an RLE. Some of the newer premium IOLs are quite good at getting good distance and near vision. But again, s/he should ask the surgeon who is doing the procedure.""

Here are my comments:

\&gt; For your -10.00, 40+ year-old friend, I'd think most surgeons would prefer an&gt; RLE.&gt; Some of the newer premium IOLs are quite good at getting good distance and&gt; near vision. But again, s/he should ask the surgeon who is doing the procedure.

You know, this is exactly what the surgeon recommended: RLE.

Some of the reasons for the RLE:

\-a- with LASIK/SMILE, there is a chance of regression (the power might come back). ((Question: in what percentage of cases does the power come back?))- it is not usually possible to fully correct the myopia with LASIK/SMILE, since the power is so high.

\-b- there is a chance of dryness with LASIK. And this is not miniscule.-c- also, by getting RLE, you are reducing the number of operations on your eye by one. Most people are going to need cataract surgery, in any case. So, instead of two surgeries, with RLE, you have only one. (If there is a complication such as retinal detachment after RLE, then that still reduces the number of surgeries from three to two.)

Main question: what are the complications with RLE? The surgeon said that RLE is a very well understood procedure and so there are basically negligible chances of complications (less than 1 percent).

I am particularly interested in the answer to this question of complications with RLE. If you have any opthalmology research papers you could point to (or even general medicine journals such as JAMA or NEJM), I would love to take a look.",1,11,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/fpzlvf/what_are_some_of_the_complications_associated/"")",2020-03-27 09:06:48,

So I have a right lazy eye, and it is quite blurry, but I have (or well had, apparently) a perfectly good left eye that has never let me down. A month or two ago, I got new glasses mainly for my right blurry eye that also has a lens for the left eye, and it was perfect and everything was good. But recently, I feel like my left eye is degrading and something is wrong.

My eyes hurt, and I am squinting a lot. Especially my left eye, it literally feels blurrier but I don't really have another eye to compare it to. But most importantly, the left lens of my glasses now makes my left eye blurry. My theory is that something bad happened inside my left eye and that something changed inside, so the lens and my eyes do not match anymore. 

I have been having online school, and have been on electronics, basically from the second, I wake up until I sleep. And I have been barely getting 'enough' sleep as well, maybe 4-6 ish hours on most days. Could this just be 'temporary' blurriness? I don't know what to do. If my left eye goes blurry, I am quite screwed.. 

Additionally, my lazy eye cannot be cured, but are there any surgeries that will allow me my right lazy eye to be LESS blurry? I've read about LASIK but does that apply for lazy eyes. 

What do you think and recommend?

frwamg,Split-second blink like blackout when not blinking,"I'm not sure if this belongs in a neurology sub or if this is the right place for it, I apologize if this is the wrong place.

Over the past several years I've had this weird moment where my vision blacks out for a split second, its the same duration of a blink but I'm not blinking. It doesn't happen frequently, previously it was only once a month or even less than that. The past couple of weeks I've noticed it's happened once or twice a week. 

It's not painful at all and I don't lose consciousness or awareness (I've heard some people say that it could be a seizure). It happens so fast that when it first started happening I thought the lights were just flickering (we've had problems in several rooms of the house where the lights flicker) but it happened when I was in the room with someone and they said that nothing happened with the lights.

The most recent time it happened was last night after I took my nightly dose of Melatonin and Clonidine (It's a blood pressure medication my doctor prescribed me for sleep). The last several times I've had my BP checked I've had a top BP number of between 135-145, so it's been prehypertension level. I'm thinking the high blood pressure may be a result of undiagnosed sleep apnea, I'm currently experiencing enough symptoms that I'm going to be getting a sleep study done in a couple of weeks. I've also heard that it could be due to blood pressure, although I don't know if the person saying it meant high or low.

 I'll start to pay more attention to it, but I think it happens mostly at night before I go to bed. I was half awake when this happened last night.

They must have formed last year while I was marathon training outdoors. I will point them out to my doctor the next time I go in and ask for a referral to an ophthalmologist. Also, I will be buying wraparound sunglasses in the very near future.

My question is why have I never heard of pinguecula? I worked for ophthalmic OCT and ultrasound imaging companies for a long time and picked up some of the lingo through osmosis, but have never heard of this. Is it really that common? Do they typically form in such a short time (just one year)? Do you do imaging of them to monitor changes over time?

ft0lvl,Intense eye irritation when I first wake up; hurts/is hard to open eyes.,"**Current complaint:** 

Every morning when I get up and try to open my eyes, it's troublesome to do so. Not sure if it's because my eyes are dry, but I have to work hard to fully open my eyelids, or rather, open them a bit, close them, then open them a bit more and close them again, doing this until they are fully open. Obviously trying not to rub my eyes, but when doing so that seems to help the process along. After this ordeal, my eyes feel fine during the day and problem returns again in the morning after awaking.

**Questions:** 

1. Any idea what is going on with my eyes? I've never had problems with dry eyes or anything of the sort. Hopefully I'll get in to see an opthamologist soon if PCP recs (below) don't resolve the issue. Just curious to hear from the experts on the matter. TIA!
2. PCP rec for contact lens solution... is that a good rec? Should I try saline solution? I've never put contact lens solution directly on my eye, just used it per label instructions when I used to wear contact lens over 15 years ago.

**History:** 

Back in December last year I woke up with redness in the left eye. Called PCP, since it was a holiday, they called in abx for pink eye. The redness persisted through the abx regimen with crusting in the mornings after waking up and irritation went from initially not bad to very irritating. On the last day of the abx course, I woke up with no redness in the left eye, but the right eye was now red. Because of my health care insurance at the time, I had to change PCP's and that wouldn't happen until the new year. I switched to just using Visine drops and the right eye eventually cleared up in a few days as I recall. All throughout this, from the start, the current complaint from above has persisted. Since the new year until 2 weeks ago, I have woken up with either the right or left eye (never both at the same time) being red and crusty and then resolving within a day or so - this has maybe happened 3 times. 

**2 weeks ago:** 

I finally established care (I know, ever the procrastinator) after waking up in the early, early morning with severe irritation in my left eye, watery/discharge and the eye was red. The right eye looked clear, but there was still the struggle of opening the eye as described above. After PCP visit, I was given abx drops for both eyes, 4x/day. Left eye cleared up within a few days, but with trouble opening eyes continuing to persist. Per PCP recs as of today via RN phone call, I'll be getting contact lens solution to wash out my eyes daily for a few days to see if that helps, if not I will be referred to an opthamologist.",1,11,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/ft0lvl/intense_eye_irritation_when_i_first_wake_up/"")",2020-04-01 07:17:54,

I feel so bad that I have to give away my healhty eye function at such young age. I feel so bad about it , I need hope that it wont be a problem in my everyday life..
I've read so much about different IOLs, the doc said he would personally recommend me EDOFS with a mini monovision because of my young age
But because I said glares and halos would be a big problem for me, because I love driving at night and I wouldn't wanna give away my ability to drive.
Now we will do Monovision with Monofocals , because there is the lowest risk to losing ability to see at light and glares.
but then I've read that monovision takes away stereo vision, and that would be very very bad.
also I have read it's dangerous to drive like that.
it's so hard..
basically the most important thing to me is that I wont feel like that I'm disabled or something for the rest of my life.
Its important for me to see faces clear infront of me. I'm afraid I would from now on always see faces blurry with the monofocals set for distance / or monovision.
I dont want blur if i kiss my girlfriend or wake up next to her.
i want to be able to drive at night without problems, also being able to drive with good stereovision.
A big hobby of mine is cars, and I absolutely love driving my car at its limits on country roads.
Also I do Kickboxing and BJJ, I'm afraid I wont see my partner infront of me sharp anymore.
I still want to be able to read my texts, or change a song in the car.
My idea would have been to take the monofocals and then use multifocal contacts, I couldnt find anything to this combo in the internet.
I have no experience with multifocal contacts, I cant imagine how they would work, in my imagination I would think that they would be just like if I had multifocal IOLs, the doc said it wouldnt be as sharp as a an implanted lense tho.
I've read that it takes some time to get used to them, I thought I could maybe wear them always except when I'm driving at night and that this would be the best way to have a clear image on all distances.
also I dont care about crystal clear vision, it should just seem natural to see all distances
I really would be fine to see up to 20 meters and use glasses only for driving.
I would have no problems to wear driving glasses.

For the past few weeks, I (24 F) have been waking up, from both sleeping and naps, with very blurry vision.

No amount of blinking, rubbing, or using eye drops speeds this process up. In addition, when I look up or down without moving my head, I initially see dark spots in the middle edge (top or bottom, depending if I'm looking up or down) of my vision, but that stops happening about as fast as the close-up comes back into focus. Lastly, I have rainbow-y starbursting (is that a word?) around very bright lights (like headlights, streetlights, etc.) when I look at them without my glasses/window in between. That said, I'm not feeling any pain.

I use eye drops occasionally for allergic dry eyes, but I'm not having issues of itching/pain with that at the moment. No family history of vision issues that I know of. Any ideas?

fvagod,Should I see a doctor soon or wait? Eyesight dramatically changed in one eye and floaters,"Background story- I was in Bolivia and decided to get the yellow fever vaccine and that’s when everything started for me. I had an allergic reaction to the vaccine and had to get 1mg of epinephrine injection in my vein. The next 2 days I had horrible headaches when I tried to strain I would sweat and feel nauseous. The headaches would last about 10 min and go away but they were pretty bad. About 5 days later I broke out in hives again and was given an intramuscular injection of cortisone. Next day I had another bad headache but this time it lingered for about 3 days but it was not that painful. One day I woke up and I noticed my eyesight in my left eye was off, had a tingling sensation on the left side of my check, and then felt nauseous. The next day I woke up and the tingling sensation went up to my eye.. so I went to the ER in (Cusco) and they said it was stress related and I had a bacterial infection. 2 days later I come back to the US. I made and eye appointment and then it was cancelled later that week because of Covid-19. I decided to just deal with my eye sight being off in the meantime but I feel like it’s getting worse. I feel a bit dizzy if I walk outside because I feel like both my eyes are working differently. I laid down on the grass today and looked at the sky and noticed little things flickering... which scared me because I’ve never experienced that before. So I’m not sure if I should make an urgent appointment or sit this out for another month or so?

- Left eye feels blurry/ off. I feel like it’s getting worse
- left eye feels heavy when I move my eye 
- Blurriness only in the distance not close
- I am near-sided -4.5 in both eyes and have been for ~10ys
- Saw eye floaters when I looked in the sky
- can’t walk without getting a bit dizzy due to the changes in my vision

I can't tell exactly how long this has been happening because for a while I had a twitchy eyelid, but this has stopped since I started taking anxiety medication. However, now that the twitch has stopped and my sight is still shaky, I'm a bit worried.

Hi all! I’m looking for advice about a chalazion ive been dealing with, and since I can’t go to an office at the moment due to covid, I thought I’d come here. 
Around Christmas 2019 I developed a stye- swollen eyelid and all. I went to an eye doctor straight away who gave me antibiotics (doxy) and I did warm compresses as well as started taking fish oil. Despite my efforts, it still turned into a chalazion. It is not the worst chalazion in the world but it makes me self conscious. I plan to get it taken care of once offices start opening but I’m so confused about which methods are best: Excision VS steroid injection VS IPL. I am most interested in IPL but I’m wondering why it’s not used for chalazion more often.",1,1,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/fvgrn7/patient_needing_chalazion_advice/"")",2020-04-05 09:43:07,

fw1t3r,Lower portion of vision flickers sometimes when I look down,"I am a bit farsighted but have otherwise good vision, 21 years old. I also have a lot of ligamentous laxity in my upper neck due to joint hypermobility syndrome coupled with a whiplash injury, which I'll explain why I think might be relevant. 

I spend a good amount of time (especially lately, quarantine and all) sitting on the couch with my laptop on my lap and often going back and forth between looking down at the laptop and up at the TV screen. 

This doesn't happen unless I've been sitting for at least an hour or so and developed a bit of neck stiffness (which isn't unordinary), but sometimes when I look back down to my laptop, some of the lower portion of my vision (mostly in the left side and far below what I'm looking at) flickers rapidly for just a second or two. When I say ""flicker"" I mean there's kind of an overlay of blueish(?) light, it's hard to imagine the color. It kind of fades away instead of ending abruptly.

The reason I think the neck issues might be a factor is because something very similar was happening when I had my eyes closed, trying to sleep the first few nights after the neck injury. It was a lot worse and actually kept me awake because it kept starting + fading away repeatedly, and was really noticeable over the darkness of my eyelids. I don't remember it happening before the injury either. If I had to guess I would think it's related to my suboccipital muscles.

I was on an ophthalmology rotation a month or so ago before everything stalled and saw idiopathic cnv. Patient was 23 year old male. White. Normal BMI. Complained of a blurry spot in the right eye for a month. No other symptoms. Never had this before and has no family history of macular degeneration.

PMH: migraines,alopecia of the beard
FH: late onset lupus grandmother, dad MS
Meds:None  
ROS: blurry vision right eye all else negative 

Slit lamp should peripapillary membrane. Nothing else abnormal according to the doc. 

OCT: obvious fluid. 

Vision: 20/20 both eyes

Lab: Ana,CBC,cmp,toxoplasmosis,syphillus all negative or within normal limits. 

He was treated with avastin and when he returned three weeks later is was resolved. He only complained of a smaller blurry spot than before. OCT showed fluid had almost completely resolved and fibrosis was occurring. Vision still 20/20 both eyes. 

My question is as I find this disease fascinating from what I have read is what’s the long term outcome? Why would this even happen?

As you know, I can't visit my normal eye doctor right now.  I have never worn contacts but might want some to use a VR headset without glasses that is focused at 2 meters.  I am interested in the best possible vision money aside.

Right now I have 2 prescriptions, the ""general"" prescription:

|Eye|Sphere|Cyl|Axis|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|OD|\-1.25|null|null|
|OS|\-1.25|\-0.75|078|

And my distance 1 meter prescription that I wear programming computers at work:

|Eye|Sphere|Cyl|Axis|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|OD|\-0.50|null|null|
|OS|\-0.50|\-0.75|078|

So wearing the headset with no glasses my right eye I can't tell a difference difference with and without the glasses.  My left eye seems to do best with the ""general"" prescription, but is still better using the ""1m"" prescription, and without is a little blurry.

Question 1:  
Do you use the same information for contacts?  Should I only use one for my left eye?  There are so many brands, do you recommend a certain brand for dry eyes?

Question 2:  
Would it be crazy to make up my own prescription for 2m focus like guessing Sphere -0.75 or -1.0?  If in doubt I could just stick to the general one.",1,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/fw8vug/new_to_contacts_looking_for_best_vision_at_2/"")",2020-04-06 15:52:54,

But now they are more common. I am 25 now. Beside that I have a lot of floaters. I have had my pupils dilated twice and they didn't thought it was serious. Its been more than a year now that I have them. I know we are gonna have more and more of them as we age. Am at at risk of something serious in the future as I have a lot of them at this age?

I visited a doctor as my eyes were turning red lately and it looks like there's a jell like layer over the white that's seems to have grown from the corner of the eyes. He told me not to worry about pterygium and prescribed reflur and refresh tears instead.
So my question are:

 1.It all started with dry eyes and twitches. Does dry eyes causes floaters and pterygium? 

2.Does floaters at young age lead to any complications later?

3.Are pterygium genetic? My mom had them removed from the same doctor I mentioned above. 

4.(Based on internet search) I came to know that pterygium are result of exposure to sunlight and uvrays. If the light emitted by digital devices are similar enough to UV rays  to break your sleep cycle and melatonin productions, can they also lead to pterygium??

fyshm0,White cloud in iris,"Hi everyone, I notice that if I go to bed late and/or am on my phone/computer I occasionally will wake up with this kind of small tiny stuck piece of mucus in my right eye. When I blink, it feels like something is in my eye. I usually relieve it by taking a tissue or something and gently taking it out, as it doesn't wash out with water or eye drops. These whitish clouds though, are present in the left eye but it's much less noticeable. In both eyes, the clouds are pretty much permanent, causing no discomfort, but the mucus piece that bothers me will only appear in the right eye. The right eye also is the drier eye. I started wearing contacts a few years ago, but I don't wear them much anymore. I am just curious as to what this could be, as it literally only bothers me when I go to sleep late, and even then only sometimes.

fyx93n,Eye Pain - Cross post with r/optometry,"Just wanted to cross post this to get some more opinions. Basically my left eye has been pretty dry after a checkup for some eye pain I was having, everything turned out fine and i'm getting new glasses. I developed some dry eyes so I just left them alone and didn't look at my devices as much.  Yesterday afternoon, I developed some eye pain that felt like something was stuck in my eye, I started doing some warm eye compressions which helped a little bit. Now my eye has gotten fairly red and the pain is now all over my eye and is now more of a burn than a sharp pain. I'll leave a image down below as to what it looks like. No vision or bluriness, just the pain at the moment. Thanks and take care guys.

fyzvz9,Help! I’ve been to two ophthalmologists and my problem hasn’t been fixed,"Hey reddit sorry for the long post ahead but please help I don’t know what else to do. I know there are other more serious problems than mine but I’m getting frustrated as I’ve been to two doctors already and nothing has changed. I keep getting sties in both eyes constantly. And I’m talking about huge ones that make my entire eyelid inflamed and also ones than look like tiny pimples. The bottom of my eyelids also look really red. Every night it seems like there are new ones. This has been going on since dec2019 and I visited the first doctor in January. 

First doctor told me all I had to do to fix it was to start washing my eye lids with baby shampoo and that should fix everything. Wrong. It did nothing, sties kept coming back.

Went to a different doctor in February and he said I have “bugs” in my eyes that are “peeing” and I’m “allergic to their pee.” He said that after looking at me for .5 seconds but he actually prescribed me something for it- steroid and antibiotic drops (Alrex&amp;amp;Besivance). He said use for a month and go back.

I used them for a month and NO CHANGE. I went to the monthly check up and he said he’ll just refill my prescription and to try them for another month. It’s already been half of that second month and I’m not seeing any improvement so I’m thinking of going to a 3rd doctor (once the current situation dies down).

My main question is- what are conditions you think i may have so I can bring them up to the next doctor so hopefully this can be fixed.",1,8,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/fyzvz9/help_ive_been_to_two_ophthalmologists_and_my/"")",2020-04-11 01:14:41,

fzqk8e,Worried about blur in trial contact lens,"I’ve been wearing contact lenses for three years now. I've always gone to the same O.D. — although, due to the ongoing pandemic, their office is closed and not set to re-open anytime soon. Today, due to the aforementioned reason, I had an eye exam for contact lenses and glasses at an office elsewhere.

Although, at this office, the exam was like one that I never had before. I say that because, not including the pre-testing procedures, the eye exam — with the O.D. — only took 9 minutes. Seriously. There was a timer on my right side to record that. The O.D. was on the office’s television, live-streaming from elsewhere, thus simply had me read the traditional “eye chart.” Apparently, no, this is not a temporary set-up due to COVID-19 — this is the traditional set up at this office as they use another service that provides an O.D. by live stream. I also didn’t have to read the eye chart in its entirety. I was presented one line at a time, being lines of what appeared to be in three or four sizes.

My prescription changed in only one eye — and by +0.25 at that. Although, I’m wearing trial lenses in the same brand and prescription that I usually wear. I say that I’m wearing the same prescription that I usually wear because, with the prescription in one eye that changed, a trial pair was unavailable in that prescription. Thus, I was matched with the next closest prescription which just so happened to be my last one.

Oddly enough, I can’t see clearly out of the eye that wears a trial lens that is correct and in the exact same prescription that I wore previously. Even with my previous pair of contact lenses, that I wore previously, I’m having no issues with the said prescription and can see clearly.

I did tell this to those who were at the office (not an O.D. as — again — not in the office). They were a bit concerned that I may need a retest but ultimately shrugged it off as one eye trying to overcompensate for the other because the other was indeed wearing an outdated prescription. Although, this doesn’t seem to make much sense (to me) as I don’t have this issue when wearing the same exact prescriptions — that I’m wearing in the trial lenses — when I wear my previous pair of contact lenses. Thus, they also mentioned that it could just be a problem with the particular lens that I was given as a trial lens.

All in all, the lens of concern is not uncomfortable — I just can’t see clearly out of it for a reason that remains unknown. It’s not noticeable unless I’m at a distance and trying to read smaller letters at 3+ feet away. So, I was advised to move along with ordering contact lenses and glasses in the given prescription.

I’m just wondering if this is odd or concerning. As in, what should I consider doing about this — if anything? To me, the most logical answer is that something is simply wrong with the particular lens that I was given as a trial lens — thus nothing wrong with the prescription as, again, I see clearly with this prescription when wearing a past pair of lenses.

Additionally, if I can still see perfectly clearly — as far as I know now — with the prescription that’s incorrect by +0.25, as the correct prescription was unavailable in a trial lens — should I potentially be concerned about the supposed correct prescription actually being incorrect and my precaution therefore not changing at all in either eye? From past experience, my prescription changes by either 0 or +0.25 each year.

I simply ask because, of course, contact lenses and glasses are expensive — I paid $550+ today for contacts, exams, and glasses combined — and I only make this expensive purchase, with glasses, every two years.

fzqvom,Help with my eye problems I've had for 7 years,"Hello, I am hoping I can get some answers on here, as I've been to around 7 doctors and they've all given me the ok that I am fine, but my symptoms just get worse and worse.

I've seen flashes of light, eye floaters, and dark spots for around 7 years now (since I was 14), and as a 21 year old, it's terrifying. I haven't had any vision loss, but i'm afraid I will get to that point without some treatment or diagnosis given to me. It seems to be getting worse every day now, when all of last year it wasn't changing that much.

My symptoms are: Flashes of light, eye floaters (a lot), very sensitive to light, dark spots (they have gotten less frequent over the years), dark lines on the outside of my vision (hard to explain).

Some of these symptoms appeared just 2 years ago, when I had these problems for over 7 years. As someone who's been to 7 different eye doctors, 2 being retina specialist, it's hard to just take a ""we can't find anything wrong with your retina"", but things just get worse and more severe. I know I can absolutely live with this condition I have, but I can't tell you I could if it gets 50 times worse than it already is, which is why it's so hard to deal with day-to-day. I am currently 21 years old, and didn't have any accidents, or anything that could cause this. I just randomly saw flashes one day and it got worse from there on out.

I try to look up help, but everyone that says they've had this problem, they've had it for only a few days, and they say it goes away. I've had mine for 7 years, and though i'm told it could just ""go away"" and they think it won't get much worse, it's too anxiety inducing.",2,8,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/fzqvom/help_with_my_eye_problems_ive_had_for_7_years/"")",2020-04-11 22:31:50,
fzx421,Cornea abrasion? Advice for what to do amidst pandemic?,"The night before last, after taking out my contacts, I got a minor dirt-in-my-eye feeling that soon subsided. Then, last night, after I took out my contact lenses, I started to get the feeling that there was something stuck in my left eye’s upper inner corner. This time the sensation persisted. However, upon looking, I couldn’t find a visible culprit. I feel it when I blink, and unfortunately for my sleep last night, when I keep my eyelid closed. I can ignore it enough to fall asleep if my eye is still. 

Once in the past, I had a similar sensation whenever I removed my contacts. My optometrist found that I had an eyelash pointing backwards into my eye, that my contact was actually protecting me from. So I looked for eyelashes like that, and even plucked a few from the corner of my eye that looked suspicious, but that didn’t seem to be the problem. 

I then read that gritty feelings might be corneal abrasions, and that contacts can sometimes cause them. I have a stare-at-my-computer-all-day job, and last night I also got petty absorbed in played a game whose release I’d been excited for... probably not blinking as much?

A lot of optometrist’s offices seem to be closed due to covid-19, and it’s Sunday anyway so the other services / communication avenues they’re still providing aren’t available until tomorrow. I really don’t want to go to an urgent care clinic at this time, given the pandemic.

g01laj,Can I use an old contacts prescription for glasses?,"I got a change in prescription a few years ago, at 40. The optometrist said it was supposed to be a sort of “compromise” prescription - an average of near and far, some way of holding off on bifocals for a couple of years. 

Well, it sucked, I never got used to it, nothing looked right at any distance. 

So I started wearing some old glasses (actually, *very* old glasses, from 20 years ago, weaker than the ones I’d been wearing most recently). These are actually GREAT for computer and far-enough-away distances (maybe 15 feet). To read close up, I’d just take them off. I don’t actually know what the prescription on these guys is. 

Unfortunately the frames broke. 

So now I just wear my old contacts (which I think are ask fine for mid distances), with a pair of reading glasses for very close up. 

I don’t want to wear bifocals or progressives because I’m clumsy enough as it is (already have a hard time going downstairs). Bifocals or progressives would add to the hazard. 

So obviously I can’t get my eyes checked at the moment. 

Can I use my (old, expired) *contacts* prescription to get a pair of glasses (and renew my contacts)?

g1jvfh,Left eye hurts and nephropathy,"**Location:** Left eye: rear

**Onset:** In the begging of February I left work, my eyes felt strained or inflamed(not sure. Used a cold compress, right eye recovered left didn't. I exercised hard. Left eye felt a bit better. Pulled out my phone and after viewing a rapid animation from clicking an app I felt a popping sensation followed by pain and severe light sensitivity.

**Frequency:** Everyday is different but it feels better then before. Some days are better then others

**Type/Severity:**

When it first happened I had severe pain and light sensitivity, I couldn't drive at night.

It's mostly better but I feel irritation/ticklish feelings. I sometimes also feel tinging go down my neck (this is not as frequent anymore(or at least not as severe)). This irritation can get worse with prolonged viewing of scrolling animations or night driving. This week the irritation has changed into an ache. Flashing(as in the screen quickly chnaged to a different page) or an image that slid across the screen fast will sometimes trigger a shock feeling.

Consistent floaters came out some point.

I may have(not too sure) become slightly more near sighted.

**Self-treatment:** Eye drops(don't seem as effective anymore) and covering my eye. Exercise to increase blood flow. For some reason eating reduces symptoms temporarily.

**Effect:** I sometimes avoid using my phone with my left eye. Somedays when its really bad it distracts me while night driving.

**Associated Symptoms:** Sometimes the pain or irritation is really distracting. I do have dry eyes

g38j4t,Some questions about retinal detachment (due to eye trauma),"Hello, I have a few questions regarding retinal detachment after a closed globe eye trauma (a blow or a poke to the closed eye)

1. How strong must impact on eye be to cause RD? Is it only after a serious attack (eg. after being beaten up; bruised eye, sport or boxing injuries), or can it also happen after a slight and minor accidental injury that doesn´t even hurt so much (no bruise, nor other eye injuries at the moment)?
2. How long after an eye injury this usually happens, what is the longest time interval you´ve heard of? If RD happens, let's say, 15 years after the injury, does it means it was caused by that or are other factors (myopia, aging) prevalent?
3. Also, what percent of closed eye injuries ends in late-onset RD (if you have information)?

I´m asking these questions because I fear RD very much since I had some minor eye injuries that happened more than 2 years ago (Bf poked me in the eye, and my younger brother punched me accidentally, but not very hard). My last dilated eye exam was in March of this year, and everything was fine. I sometimes get quick flashes of light but I realized they happen mostly when I am stressed out, and I´ve had them even before the injuries.  I am also myopic (-2.25 left eye, and -2,50 right eye).

I posted in this subreddit a while ago about having a blurry cover over my vision that would adjust with eye movement.

g3s6a6,Eye floaters and flashes of light in the total darkness.,"62yo male, non-smoker.

Two years ago I had cataract surgery and a year later laser capsulotomy in both eyes. And everything seemed to be fine. But yesterday, when I approached the mirror in my bathroom, I thought there was something flying around, like a **small black butterfly with gray almost transparent folded wings**. I was shocked when I realized that it was in my right eye, floating on the peripheral side. So I started searching the Internet and learned a lot about eye floaters. I thought that although I had a floater, luckily I had no flashes of light. But I was wrong because I was mislead by the articles on the Internet that said nothing about seeing anything in the **total darkness**, which was misleading because most people find it impossible to see anything without light. By all means it **is** possible, and it happened to me. Now I believe that I have a **posterior vitreous detachment** because I discovered an unusual phenomenon. When I am moving the eyeballs with my eyes open in the dark, the retina in my right eye receives non-visual signals and the brain interprets them as flashes of light. Each flash lasts about 200ms, and I often see 2 or 3 flashes in a row. Those bright circles are actually **rings**. Assuming that the external diameter is 100mm, the width of the edge is about 5mm. They are usually white, **sometimes yellow** but each ring is always in one color. When I see several rings in a row, some of them are **a bit shifted horizontally**, by their width (pretty precisely). Sometimes I see only the left or right half of the ring or even less. But the edges are always pretty sharp and smooth, like a **laser projection**. Although my experience is very subjective, I thing that I am not alone with it. After all, eyes and brains of other people are not very different from mine. Should I see an eye doctor immediately? I am afraid of a possible retinal tear or detachment.

I eventually saw an ophthalmologist who told me I had a 'pit' on my eyeball and prescribed medication to deal with the herpes. It cleared up but the pit remains (in line of sight causing a kind of double vision from that eyeball making it hard to focus).

g9rvvj,Should I see a new eye doctor or my old optometrist for uveitis (25f),"Hi. I feel like I’m kind of in a pickle so I thought maybe I could get some decent advice. 

A year ago I got dx with anterior uveitis and glaucoma by an optometrist. He’s in a clinic with ophthalmologists but he said he felt comfortable treating me with eye drops and told me it could indicate I need to see a rheumatologist, and long story short I did. Positive Ana and high CRP (75) and SED (100) but negative for RA, Lupus, Sarcoidois, etc. they told me I most likely have Behçets or something similar. My rheumatologist told me to start humira and recommended I see a ophthalmologist because she said an optmitrist shouldn’t be my primary eye doctor for it. 


I took her advice and called the clinic she recommended but the person she suggested had just gone out on medical leave so I saw another doctor. He was not a retinal specialist nor a uveitis specialist, but he said there wasn’t anything wrong with my eyes and told me he thought I wanted pain medication...which is weird because I don’t take any pain medicine and I told him I had started humira two months prior and it was helping a lot with the systemic issues and ulcers so it might be helping my eyes too. I was really upset by him and I just kept seeing my old eye doctor after. 


The optometrist does do slit lamp tests and I did have two field vision tests when they were looking into glaucoma stuff and he mentioned that I had lost most of the peripheral vision in my right eye (which is my eye that tends to get uveitis flares) but he’s never done any other testing. 

Now I’m on remicade and azathioprine and the past three days I’ve had new spots in my vision, lots of pain and flashing lights. My rheumatologist has covid and is out of the office and i left a voice mail and email with her partner but haven’t heard a response. I was on the tail end of a pred taper for a flare two weeks ago and now I’m just stretching it out at the end to get to tomorrow without being in agonizing pain. This eye pain doesn’t feel as sharp as my usual anterior uveitis and is a deeper, aching pain that specifically hurts when I move my eye (it’s only in my left eye). If i didn’t know better I’d say it was a ocular migraine but it doesn’t feel quite like that either; and with my medical history I’m nervous to brush it off. I’ve taken Aleve, ibuprofen and Tylenol this weekend to no relief and I don’t feel comfortable taking more prednisone without my doctors order (I’m taking just an extra weekend of 10 mg when I was supposed to go down to 5 and then 0 today) 

Now...should I call a new eye doctor tomorrow or just keep seeing the old one? I’m so nervous a new eye doctor won’t believe me but I’m nervous my old eye doctor is not treating me correctly. I lost a lot of vision last year and my current eye doctor just shrugged and offered more prednisone drops. I feel like if I didn’t hound my doctors for a rheum referral I might have lost even more of my vision. I do have a remicade infusion on Friday but I can’t even sit in my living room without an eye patch on right now.

gabanx,How Long is Too Long? Prolonged pupil dilation,"Due to the state of the world my Ophthalmologist and Optometrist have not yet responded to my calls of concern, so I figured I'd crowd-source this while I wait for their response.   


I was recently diagnosed with traumatic iritis and traumatic mydriasis as a result of a recent assault (Saturday). My right eye was struck and I had temporary vision loss following the attack, but it did return over time somewhat. I was prescribed a topical steroid for the inflamation/irritation (Prednisolone) and a drop to dilate my pupil (Atropine 1%). The steroid works great; the Atropine works TOO well.  


I'm supposed to administer two drops of the Atropine a day. I took my first drop yesterday evening. When I woke up this morning, my pupil was still fully dilated. I understand that the mydriasis means the iris is damaged and is not reacting to light like normal. With my pupil now fully dilated, I am having difficulty reading and working. I am worried that the dilating drops will cause my pupil to be ""stuck"" wide open, as opposed to where it was stuck before. I do not understand the purpose of the dilating drops for my diagnosis and I am worried that my pupil does not seem to be responding. Why would an ophthalmologist recommend dilating a damaged pupil? Could this be an adverse reaction with the steroid? How long is the dilation supposed to last (I'm on 15+ hours so far with just one drop)? Is there any way to reverse the dilation?   


I have called both my doctors and they have yet to respond. In the meantime I am holding off on taking the medication until I get a response. I don't want to make the problem worse, but im also afraid if not taking my medication will have the same effect. I don't know what to do. I plan to follow up again with them at noon.

Questions

1. His eye glasses ( per prescription above) cause his eyes to turn immediately when he wears them. Considering this should he continue  to wear them ? Are the glasses making his eyes better or worse? \[We force him to wear when he watches TV. Other times he takes them off\]

2. His eye turns in, when he tries to focus something close (within 6 inches to 2 ft). When he looks at things 10 ft away (primary gaze), he  is able to align the eyes &amp; get binocular vision. What does this indicate ? What are the chances for him to get binocular vision when focuses things up close ? Is esotropia categorized by focusing distance ? Or is this an effect of myopic astigmatism ? 

3. Does astigmatism evolve into amblyopia ? 

4. Has anyone of you had the combination of these two (alternating esotropia &amp; myopic astigmatism) ? What are the  treatment options ?",1,13,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/gargj6/alternating_esotropia_myopic_astigmatism/"")",2020-04-30 00:55:26,

gbmevp,"Strabismus as a child, starting to have double vision now as an adult"," 

I was born with strabismus. I had surgeries in both eyes as a toddler.

I cannot remember how my vision was as a child. I know after surgery they tried some patching and glasses.

Most of my life as teenager and adult, my vision has been like this:  
\- Left eye strong. 20/20 vision if corrected. (went from +1.25 in teens to +0.25 currently)  
\- Right eye weak. Less than 20/20 if corrected. (went from +2 in teens to +2.75 currently)  
\- Astigmatism in both eyes  
\- Can switch eyes for looking with, other eye vision is suppressed.

I am 29 now and in the last year or so I have been having on and off double vision. When I look with the right (weak) eye. The image from the left (strong) eye is creeping in. It's especially bad when looking at a specific object or watching TV. I will see two heads on people, etc. The double image will be on the left side but isn't completely static, it will move around. It has been becoming more and more persistent overtime.

How my eyes act:  
\- When looking with Left eye unfocused, Right eye drifts up.  
\- When looking with Left eye focused, RIght eye turns in.  
\- When looking with Right eye unfocused, Left eye turns slightly out.  
\- When looking with Right eye focused, Left eye turns in.

Why I think this could have happened?  
\- Mild concussion recently (couple years ago)  
\- Years of working on computer after finishing school  
\- Me trying to deliberately use my right eye more as I felt it getting weaker (prescription getting worse)

What have I done?  
\- Saw a vision therapist, very expensive and did not seem totally backed in science  
\- Saw an ophthalmologist. Had no idea why this could've happened and just wants me to keep monitoring. Doesn't know if a surgery could fix it. Will let their orthoptic specialist take a look when I go back in a couple months.  
\- Tried patching myself for instant relief but I know its not good to do this on my own.

So this is driving me nuts and affecting my work productivity as well as making me slightly nauseous and giving me more headaches in general. I am not sure what else I can do from here.

I can't play video games any more. I don't have a problem if not watching the screen except than a soft dryness but when I play the eyes get really irritated. I didn't have this problem before. But it's getting really really annoying and I don't know what to do and why this is happening.Also, when I watch a screen I don't have this problem, only when I play video games. 
No vision changes, but my eyes are really red. The doctor told me to use steroids for some days. It was working for that moment after the steroid drops but it was only temporary. 

To sum this up, the worst symptom for me is that I wake up with dry eyes(but like super dry eyes) and I close my eyes completely 100% while asleep.

gegpyn,Intermittent Sudden Double Vision 2 Weeks Ago (Suspected MGD) - Concern as there has been no clearup of double vision?,"Just a brief rundown of the occurrence.

2 weeks ago, at night had sudden onset of vertical double vision. Currently home working and use a computer for my job. Came on at night whilst having downtime on a game. Use glasses for anything computer related. Thought it could be slept off but couldn't. It's not persistent but rather intermittent, so can happen at any random time.

Went to the opticians and the optometrist believed it was MGD. Didn't think there was muscle issues and vision tests I apparently did well in. So have been using an eye compress (The Eye Doctor) for a week and half. Been able to move the oils in the eyes and lid clean but no difference to the double vision, have good days where it doesn't happen as much and days where it's quite often (today so far has been a good day.)

If the issue is MGD as he thinks, how long does treatment need to last before I will see the benefits and the double vision going? I understand this is chronic.

No headaches, no difficulty swallowing, no issues with balance or hand-eye coordination, left eye lid bit lower than the right and no weakness in any part of the body. Can correct the double vision by slightly tilting my head forward or if I look directly up with my eyes when it happens. 

First though was just heavy eye strain has taken it's toll thanks to my job and then a bit of gaming afterwards. Lazy eye also crossed my mind. MGD of course. General health is very good, no illnesses. Hoping it's just eye strain more than anything.

I only see it when I'm about to fall asleep. It lasts about a long 1 second and looks like a dimmed camera flash. Always startles me.
 
Prior to this, minimal flashes were noted. Went back to my eye doctor and said that it is normal that the eye moves while we try to sleep which causes the vitreous gel to move and tug the retina causing stimulation. Advised that no new tears and vitreous hasn't detached any further from when I last saw him for the laser procedure.

I have had myopia since early childhood, I was diagnosed at the age of 4 for the first time

My diagnose: high degree myopia, degenerative, isometropic, astigmatism, complicated chorioretinal, developed. Peripheral choriental dystrophy

I have been to eye doctor last time in July 2019 and I have done cycloscopy or retinal diagnostics in August 2019. Doctor told me that my eyes are okay, I don't have detachments or tears and that I don't need surgery or anything else.

My eyes are -9.5 in both eyes. I use soft contact lenses everyday for last year. I wear glasses at home. My glasses and contacts are -7. I see well in glasses and contacts. I have been seeing weird waves and flashes last 3 years. Usually I don't think about them and they are unnoticeable. They get intense at dark and after changing lights, for example when I turn on or turn of lights. They are noticeable in daytime and with lights too

I don't have any other serious health issues. I often have headaches and dizziness, I have had it since childhood. Doctor told me I have headaches and dizziness because of narrowed brain blood vessel. I took medication for it for 1 months and dizziness and headaches are gone, tho I have headaches occasionally(\~2 times in a months). I think waves and flashes sin my vision may be connected to it. Also I have quite bad anxiety

ghd5pq,Skin/cila rubbing on corneas.. quick question,"Hi,

40/M

I've been dealing with some degree of foreign object sensation in both eyes since I was 11. Nobody thought to look at the underside of my eyelid until I was 21 or 22. The cause was I had rows of very thin white hairs on underside of my eyelids. So the long story short is I had electralysis to try to remove the hairs, tarsal rotation to move the hairs away from my corneas. When that didnt really help the doctor removed some of the margin of my eyelid. By this point I was likely 30 or so and was still in pain so I just went to an optometrist and asked them to prescribe contacts for me. This helped some but the hairs and skin rubbing on my contacts would knock my contacts loose all of the time which caused a lot of irritation.

So I continued to try surgical alternatives every few years once I worked up the nerve to try again. Back in December I had a surgery where they did a mixed thickness fat graft from my leg and grafted it into the hard ridge of my eyelid in order to move the lid, etc away from my eyes.

This worked really well in my right eye and even improved my left eye to some degree. I can open my eyes without wearing contact lenses. The thing that confuses me about my left eye is that it feels wildly different every day. Im not saying like 5%.. its either kind of bad or world ending bad. My right eye is pretty much always a little irritated but nothing like it would have been before the surgery.

So my question is: If the pain I feel in my left eye is mechanical/rubbing then why would it vary so much unless either my eye or eyelid is different every day? Do eyes and eyelids swell? Is there any way to minimize inflamation in eyes or eyelids? Is there an effective antiinflamatory for eyes/eyelids? I am thankful for it being a little better but I am just trying to understand the variation. A doctor I met at Cleveland Clinic mentioned that my slight rosacea might be affecting my eyelids but I havent had much luck at controlling it. I use artificial tears sometimes but they seem to irritate the inside of my eyelids for some unknown reason.",1,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/ghd5pq/skincila_rubbing_on_corneas_quick_question/"")",2020-05-10 17:30:34,

ghg5jp,Blurry covering over vision,"21 F 157 lbs non smoker, GAD.

So I have had this problem for a few months where if i look somewhere and look back, theres a faint blurry covering over my vision. It's most noticeable in areas of bright light. I also see halos and streaks of light especially at night.

 I asked questions about my problem on a JustAnswer website twice and both ophthalmologists who answered my question said it was nothing to worry about, but to make an appointment with my eye doctor non urgently. 

So Friday I went to the eye center in my area for a medical checkup, and the optometrist looking at my eyes said they were completely healthy, just slight astigmatism in the left eye. I described my problem in as much detail as possible, because surely my eyes aren't completely healthy and normal if I'm seeing this blurry thing in my eyes.  All they did was write me a new prescription. I'm very confused and frustrated by this. 

I had a prescription given to me in september with lower numbers than what I received a few days ago, and I can understand how I might've been wearing the wrong prescription because the eye place I went to in september is prone to mishaps, since they rely more on telemed than in person optometrists. However, I keep reading that using a wrong prescription doesn't damage your eyes, and I hadn't had this problem until well after I received my prescription in september. 

Does anyone have any insight on this? I'm very annoyed and I just want this problem to be solved. It just seems like it's getting worse.",1,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/ghg5jp/blurry_covering_over_vision/"")",2020-05-10 20:47:11,

ghk4e1,Bright area on choroid,"Hey there,

Around 7 years ago I went to go see an Ophthalmologist who did a full work-up on me, fluorescein angiogram, dilation, the whole 9 yards. I got pictures of my retina done and choroid in general, I had to look in all different directions and then they snap a pic. Anyways, in my right eye on the side (on the choroid I guess?) well off of my retina since I have to look to my far right to give a proper viewing, lays this very large bright spot. The closest example I could find is when I google ""choroidal melanoma"".

It caught my doctor by surprise, all he really asked is if I got hit in the head as a kid, and that it could of been there since birth. He really did not pay any mind to it and I trust his professional judgment. Now that we're all locked up inside, the thought of this ""spot"" has crept back into my mind.

Has anyone else seen this in practice and have a better idea what it might be? My OCT's come back perfectly normal. My straight forward pictures are unremarkable and all is gravy. For the doctor to get viewing of it they have to put on that headset looking device and make me look to my far right .

I would like to reach to you experts/enthusiasts as I am unable to put a name on my condition.

I've been diagnosed with hypermetropia in both eyes, although stronger in my right eye, very early in my life (must have been 1 year old or so) and had strabismus. Wore glasses ever since until I was 13-14 years old, had eye patches to help strenghten my RIGHT eye. 

I felt unbelievably uncomfortable trying to see and function only with my right eye, the reason is that the vision from that eye is horrible, and frustratingly hard to explain as well. I finally found a way to describe it and I'm hoping for some answers:

Imagine how you are staring at the sun for too long and thus getting a blind spot right in the middle of your vision, to me it, usually looks purple afterwards and for some time until it heals. 
Now, what I see in my right eye could be hundreds or more tiny blindspots making it impossible to read on my phone. 
Those blindspots don't have a color, instead it looks like I see through them, this isn't a problem if I'm looking at something plain like a pink T-shirt. I believe my brain tries to fill up the empty spaces but fails miserably once I try to read something small enough.

Bonus: I did notice that my colors in my right eye seem very slightly less bright, I had to switch from left to right eye at least 10 times to confirm that.

I am now 22 years old and I do see, I believe, normally using only my left eye, leaving the right one only to be used for extra vision and reflexes. Well anything that doesn't require much acuity.

* Age = 59 (decent health &amp; good fitness)
* Lifelong super myope: last prescription was -9.00  &amp; -8.00
* Worn soft daily contacts almost exclusively since 1977
* Using readers with contacts since \~age 40 - current readers are +2.25
* Dec. 2018 - Sept. 2019 had retina tear followed months later by detachment in right eye,
* Cataract developed in right eye following surgery (vitrectomy &amp; laser) to repair detachment
* Astigmatism is .5 &amp; .8

Goals:

* Do what's best for the health of my eyes and quality of vision for next 25+ years
* Pass driver's license eye exam (20/40?) without glasses
* Read large print without glasses

Using glasses for reading would not be a hardship. Nor would using glasses to drive at night. Just being basically functional without glasses will be like a dream after a lifetime as a super myope.

My research and thinking have taken me around the world and I'm back to wanting to do standard cataract surgery with monofocal lens (especially as insurance will pay almost entire cost.)

Will see doctor Monday to make final pre-op decisions.

Questions:

* Am I correct in assuming that there is general consensus in the profession that the traditional cataract surgery  achieves at least as good outcomes as laser-assisted?
* In my case does the astigmatism call for laser surgery (as I think my research indicates)? Or could it be corrected with the standard cataract surgery? Or is it necessary to correct?
* All things considered are there other issues or questions that came to your mind as you read this?

And if you read this long story I am so grateful! Many thanks in advance for your thoughts and opinions.

gkevh1,PVD/Retinal detachment or tears caused by videogames?,"Hi everyone,   


So my cousin got diagnosed with PVD recently, after some weird symptoms she was having. She's only 35, mildly myopic (3.75) and is now convinced the PVD happened because she was playing side scrolling video games a lot in the few weeks before the symptoms appeared.   


She's now extremely anxious about playing any kind of video games because she's worried the PVD symptoms will worsen or a retinal detachment might occur if she returns to gaming now.   


I think she's being over cautious, but I thought I'd ask here to see if anyone knows anything about this or has heard of any possibility that playing video games can trigger PVD/retinal detachement/tears in any way? Or can gaming cause symptoms to worsen at all?   


Could looking at a screen (she's a proof reader) for the majority of the day have triggered the PVD or put her vision at risk in any immediate way?   


Or is it all just a coincidence that she got PVD young and was gaming a lot at the time?   


I'd like to try and reassure her that it's okay to go back to playing the games she loves, but I don't want to encourage her to do anything that may risk her vision and wind up with her needing surgery, given the current global situation.

gkn7rn,I had cataract surgery yesterday - mini-monovision question,"Had a monofocal lens placed in the dominate eye yesterday and today at distance I measured at 20/15 which is great.  I'm going to have the non-dominate eye done at the end of next week. My doctor and I have talked about doing the next implant as a mini-monovision.  Unfortunately the cataract in the remaining eye is a dense nuclear cataract and the vision in that eye is just a mess.  We tried dropping in a contact to target about 1 diopter under corrected as a test, but with the monocular diplopia and haziness due to the cataract it's really not a very good test.

So, I'm wondering if any of you professionals could give me your opinions.  I was thinking about doing a 1 diopter mini-mono.  I get the impression that my ophthalmologist likes to go smaller than that, say 0.5d but I'm wondering how useful that will be to me.

My goal is to be able to read my phone and stuff on a shelf in front me in a store without putting on readers.  I know I will never again have near vision like I did before the surgery.  Back when I was wearing glasses it was common for me to end up about a diopter under corrected on one side after a number of years in the same prescription which gave me no issues, but I understand I still had accommodation then so it's not apples and apples.

I am very satisfied with the distance vision I'm getting out of the dominate eye. I doubt I've ever been able to see so well in my life.  I've been myopic since the 7th grade and have never had very good distance vision.  Even with glasses or contacts I was usually never corrected better than 20/25 or 20/30.  But, if course I had *excellent* near vision which I'm actually going to miss since I sometimes need to do close up detailed work in my job and in my hobbies.  I've tried using readers today and it's just not the same being able to focus up close with that myopic eye. But, I'm very thankful that I live in a time where cataract surgery and IOLs are available, because I was headed towards complete blindness at some point without these technologies.

IOLs are an amazing thing.  I went from 20/80 to 20/15 in about 24 hrs.

A stupid question, but nonetheless one I'd like to hear about. I got a sudden increase in floaters recently, and went to get my eyes checked.

gky95c,29 years old with floppy eyelid syndrome please help,"Background- 29 F slightly overweight, former smoker, non drinker, non drug user. 

Last year I became pregnant and had a feeling I developed sleep apnea. At the same time I would wake up with dry, gritty eyes sometimes leaking discharge. 

I went to the eye doctor who told me it’s just allergies. I was prescribed olapatadine 0.2% twice a day. 

After I had my baby I was prescribed Zoloft for anxiety. I lost all the weight I gained during pregnancy (35 lbs) but my sleep apnea didn’t go away. After Zoloft it seemed to get worse. I do have very very large tonsils but no one has ever suggested removal. 

I went back to an eye doctor last week saying I believe I have floppy eyelid syndrome. She confirmed that I had “terrible floppy eyelid syndrome” and said there’s not much I can do about it. She said to continue the drops and wear a sleep mask. I asked about surgery or ways to fix it and she said it’s not reversible but I’ve seen things online that suggest otherwise. 

Since wearing the mask my eyes seem less puffy in the mornings. I do end up waking up with the mask off me multiple times a night. 
I know that the first step is doing a sleep study to confirm what I already know.

glcydd,How to explain what is happening so I'm not wasting the doctor's time &amp; an astigmatism question.,"Light is painful.  Usually a 2 to 2.5 on the pain scale, but it can get worse depending on the intensity of the light.  When it gets worse my eyes water more than they usually do and it's really hard to keep from closing them to protect against the light.  If things touch my eyelashes then my eyes will also water for some reason.  When my eyes water it's hard to focus my vision (of course).  But this means that my eyes are doing nothing but watering during vision tests and eye exams.

This is making it so my vision tests are, while not worthless, kind of a crap shoot.  If the Phoropter (I looked up the name) is touching my eyelashes then my eyes are non-stop watering and I'm having a hard time telling the difference between 1 and 2 because I can't really focus on either one of them and it hurts to look at the letters anyway because they are on a very brightly backlit screen that also makes my eyes water because it's painful to look at.  It ends up with me desperately blinking to clear my eyes and then trying to read them or answer the question as quickly as I can before they go all blurry again.

This led to one eye exam where I tried to look through the 'final prescription' and I couldn't even focus through them.  I felt really bad, but my eyes had watered through the entire exam.  My latest exam was better, but my glasses work best when I an looking through them while they are 3 inches in front of my face.  Is there a way to explain the watering issue it's quick, concise and they get what is happening?  

On to the astigmatism question: when someone asks the question ""Which of these is clearer - Number 1 or number 2?"" are they asking ""which one of these is the sharpest?"" or are they asking ""which one is the one that each letter is made up of just the one line without the drop shadow?"".

Before I continue I know medical advice is not given over the internet, but I'm currently working/stuck in China due to covid 19, and physically do not have access to my Opthalmologist in the states.

In normal daily activities before and after I do not notice anything, and on days I don't exercise I don't notice anything. No flashing lights at all. But I am significantly near sighted, and had a percolated hole that was deemed insignificant after a couple follow-ups. I know the smart move is to go in, but I'm in China and even going to the dentist here is vastly different than the States so I expect to have no real advice from them.

glmqkp,One eye seems dryer than the other (contact lenses),"Hey all,

I have been wearing Coopervision Biofinity lenses for years but over the last while I have noticed that the lens in my right eye becomes a little uncomfortable and drys out far quicker than the one in the left eye.

gmfti4,Stye with post-LASIK dry eye not going away after 7.5 mo,"Hi, so I've had Lasik done to my eyes back in December 2018. As a result, my eyes have suffered from extreme dryness (along with red, veiny eyes and redness behind my eyelids, and small bumps on my eyelids) but while it was extreme at the beginning, it's seemingly still improving at a very slow rate.

I bring this up however, because back in October 2019, I developed a stye in my right eye. At first, it was fairly prominent and visible to anyone else looking at my eye. After two/three weeks, it subsided to the point where you couldn't see it externally. It turned into a small darker brownish bump in the back and center of my lower eyelid.

I've seen a doctor back in Jan/Feb 2020 who prescribed me Tobramycin and Dexamethasone, and told me to start with putting in 3 drops daily for a week, then two drops daily for the next week, and finally one drop daily for a final week. Around this time, I also started taking Restasis for the dry eyes.

After doing all this, I've noticed a few things:

* During the time I was using the antibiotic/steroid drops, the redness on my eyes become much clearer, the dryness improved a good deal, and the bumps on my eyelids were gone.

* The bump behind my right eyelid is still the same.

* It's been about a full week since I stopped the steroid drops and the small bumps on my eyelids are back, maybe even more than before -- I'm not sure. The dryness does seem to be a good deal better than it was before starting the steroid drops though. Not sure if that's just residual effects of the drops.


My questions are:

* Does the improvement I'm seeing in regard to the LASIK dryness even after finishing the steroid drops look promising for a full recovery from dry eye without any Restasis? Or will it revert back to how it was before the drops soon?

* Is there anything else that could help with the remnants of the stye? I'm worried if I can't treat it soon, it will cause meibomian gland atrophy. I've used a Bruder mask to help with the dry eyes as well as to liquefy the stye, but it seems to make the redness and sometimes dryness of my eyes worse, with no visible benefit to the stye.


Sorry for the long post, I've just got a lot going on with my eyes in the past couple years since after LASIK that I wanted to include as much detail as I could, in case anyone could help.

For a long time, I thought that my extra lashes were normal until my eyes got irritated for the nth time and I googled for images of eye close-ups. From those photos, I concluded that mine were really not in the norm.

My eyes have to deal with the constant sensation of sand rubbing its surface every time I blink.

The lashes would occasionally, *maybe once or twice a day,* get stuck in my tear duct and it feels so irritating, and rubbing makes it worse ( I really try not to do that but sometimes, the irritation is just unbearable)

I need opinion on whether I should see a doctor and get it plucked or lasered or whatever, or just let it be because I've only suffered mild irritation as of the moment.

An answer would be very much appreciated &lt;3 I've posted this on another eye-related subreddit hoping for advice but the chances of getting an answer seems futile so I'm betting on this one :((",1,1,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/gospj9/eyelash_growth_on_the_inner_corner_of_the_eye/"")",2020-05-22 14:55:38,
got26y,Worried after getting my eyes tested for ocular hypertension,"Hey everyone, I'm a 22 year old male. I just came back from the ophthalmologist for an issue involving what I thought was a stye on my inner eyelid (it turned out to be allergies, nothing serious).

I had a bunch of other tests done including one where a blue light was shined into my eyes. My doctor made no comment on any of these tests which I took as a good sign. He left after giving me some eyedrops and a prescription for some steroid.

Right as I was about to leave, I decided to ask the doctor's assistant what some of the other tests they ran on me were and if everything seemed alright. She told me that the blue light test was to measure my eye pressure and then mentioned that my eye pressure was a little high.

My initial reaction was fear, because I know that high eye pressure is associated heavily with glaucoma. She asked me if I have a family history of glaucoma (I don't) and then she just sort of brushed it off after that. She said that holding my breath or something may have given me that result.

I guess I seemed pretty concerned so she asked if I wanted to have the doctor run a second test just to be sure. She came back and told me that the doctor isn't concerned about my eye pressure. He said it's probably because my eyes are irritated from the allergy.

The thing is... they're not. At least not now. I've had this allergy problem with my eye for years and it's a mild nuisance at most. At the time I did the test, my eyes weren't in pain and they weren't irritated. I left pretty concerned.

I get my eyes checked about every year, and I've never been told anything about high eye pressure. Granted, the only eye pressure test I've ever been given is the ""air puff"" test which is not very accurate from what I understand.

To be clear, neither the doctor or the assistant mentioned anything about ocular hypertension. Neither of them would have mentioned anything about the test if I hadn't brought it up. But I'm afraid the ophthalmologist may have dismissed it on the false premise that ""my eyes are irritated"" when they're not... I also assume they checked my optic nerve on one of the other tests and noticed nothing abnormal.

So, I guess my question are... Is it normal for eye pressure to increase temporarily? Is it ALWAYS a bad sign for eye pressure to be over the normal range? Does eye pressure fluctuate? Should I be concerned about my eye pressure being ""a little"" high? Should I take it as a good sign that the doctor didn't address the results?",1,1,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/got26y/worried_after_getting_my_eyes_tested_for_ocular/"")",2020-05-22 15:15:29,

gou2mi,Keratoconus?,"I’m 25 (m) and I just recently graduated from dental school. I’ve had myopia and astigmatism for as long as I can remember. I wore glasses until the 10th grade then I switched to contacts. The contacts became unbearable after my first year in professional school and had to completely stop wearing them. I use glasses only when I absolutely have to because I hate them. I consider lasik but it has come to my attention that my cornea is “weird” I’ve heard this many times from optometrist and ophthalmologist. My understanding is lasik is contraindicated for ppl with keratoconus.  I have never been diagnosed but i feel like there’s evidence to suggest I may have it.  First I have never been able to read 20/20. My prescription is close enough, my nearsightedness is like -6ish and my astigmatism is like 1 (or -1 can’t remember) in both eyes. My prescription still changes every year but minimally, this includes my astigmatism. I’ve been told that ppl that go to school longer often experience vision changes as they continue to study but my understanding is (correct me if I’m wrong I’m not an ophthalmologist) that astigmatism shouldn’t change. I’m also sensitive to light and have a good amount of floaters (first noted in 2017). Anyway I’m not really looking for a diagnosis because I know that’s impossible from this post but advise. If I do have it I plan on doing the FDA approved corneal cross linking procedure and PRK. If I don’t have it should I still do PRK? Also any recommendations on how to pay for it? Do insurance cover these procedures? Normally finances wouldn’t be an issue but this virus has really delayed the time at which I can be employed.

gpniz8,"Baffled Ophthalmologists for years, curious what people on here might think.","Tl;dr had mystery eye problem that was never given a diagnosis. Mostly fixed with surgery and anti-inflammatories about 10 years ago. Seen an old picture of myself yesterday and realised my eye problem is back.

I probably saw every major eye doctor in the UK and no one could diagnose it... fancy a go?


Apologies if this isn't well worded, my main bulk of treatments/assessments were when I was between the age of about 11-16, so being a child I didnt really care what was happening and let the doctors speak to my parents for the most part.

I'm now 26/F in case it's relevant.

Okay so I was born with perfectly normal eyes as far as we know. Plenty of pictures of me from multiple angles showing that my eyes both move in all directions absolutely fine.

Around the age of 10/11 (I think), my parents noticed I would hold my head at a weird angle and that the inner corner of my right eye would get quite red. I remember it being slightly itchy and it would water a lot. 

Went to get it looked at, poked, prodded, follow the finger, follow the light, look at it through a prism, at doing hess charts.

I'm not sure of all the details but basically the outcome was that on my right eye the middle muscle nearest my nose (lateral rectus?) does not work at all and for some reason the middle muscle on the other side (medial rectus?) works over time and pulls my right eye outward.
This resulted in my eye only being able to move around in the far right quarter of my eye, with a tiny bit of limitation on looking down as well. 
To stop myself getting double vision I would subconsciously hold my head at an awkward angle to correct it. My head was turned quite far to the left and tipped forward a little.

http://imgur.com/a/lSefapj - this shows roughly the small space my eye could move in.


They didn't know what was causing the inner corner of my eye to be red and inflamed but whatever it was they believed it was still active and were worried about it so they put me on a prednisone or prednisolone (or possibly both?) through an IV drip over a 3 day period and they had me on methotrexate (7 tablets once per week at the top doseage). 

Once that had worked they carried out 2 operations.
In the first they cut the lateral rectus and shortened it I think by 1.5cm?
In the second they detached the medial rectus and reattached it about I think 2.5cm back.
The goal was to get my eye to move to the midline at least to stop me keeping my head in an awkward position as they were worried I would give myself neck and back issues.

They succeeded and my eye could almost get to the midline. There were talks of splitting some other muscles to see if I could use them to pull my eye across and almost have a normal eye but as they didnt really know what caused the problem in the first place they didnt want to do anything unnecessary. 


Fast forward to now, about 10 years later, my dad sent me an old picture that was probably taken not long after my corrective operations. In this picture I'm looking almost straight ahead. Excuse the heavy make-up, I had a pretty intense emo phase 😅

I dont take a whole lot of selfies and always compensate for the eye turn so I never really have any head on photos to compare to but I did think recently that my eye was slightly more turned than it used to be. Well after comparing it to that photo it is significantly worse now and I have actually lost a lot of downward movement.

gpojtm,Bloody eye,"Hello everyone,

I was wondering if anyone could please give me (my mom) an opinion on her eye. I fully understand that the best option is to seek medical advice from her actual ophthalmologist, however, the offices arent open till Monday, and the nature of Covid-19 is only adding to the stress. So this would be more of severity check, as we intend to see her doctor as soon as possible anyways.

Around Friday night, she had coughed and vomited violently due to a stomachache. This is what we believe caused the upper right side of her left eye to look bloody (assumed blood vessel popped). The blood also spread a little bit since the initial discovery. Although her eye looks very similar to images of broken eye vessels online, as you can see in the photo, there is a dark red, heart shaped spot that looked unlike any of the other photos we could find. Which is why we were wondering if her condition is much worse than her symptoms seem to show, and if we should visit the ER rather than wait for her ophthalmologist. Her only underlying condition is closed-angle glaucoma (corrected by laser surgery 3 years ago) and hypothyroidism.

I got glasses(multifoculs) in the beginning of march for nearsightedness, -0.75 sph in both eyes, all other variables were 0. 

Last week I had to go far an eye check-up due to an eye infection, (conjunctivitis or something I think) I couldn't read what is on the chart as good as I used to in march.

In the eye chart, there were 7 rows, I could only read the first 3 without any issues, the following four rows were totally blurry (in march I was easily able to read the first 5 rows without any problems) 

The Optholmologist only said power has increased I'm both eyes and that I'm going to need new prescription. They gave me two eye drops for infection and told me to return after two weeks. 

My next appointment is coming up in 6 days in which will I have to try the measurement lenses to know the exact power I require. Since I can't read the last four rows I'm sure it's definitely not going to be the same -0.75. How much increase in power can I expect approximately?

Could someone please answer why is it happening to me? Did the glasses make my vision worse or its something else?

First, let me say I will go to an opthomologist as soon as I can. Today is a holiday here, so they are all closed.

gqp918,Superficial K Surgery a Year Later Question,"Hello, 
Just for starters, I had PRK a couple years ago. Ok, I had an accident last year that caused me to get a chemical burn on my eye. It was ok at first and then started to scar. This led to a corneal abrasion (Dr called it that). It caused me to have obstructed vision but everything I could see was still very clear and not blurry. After monitoring, the doctor said she could fix it with Superficial Keratectomy. I had the procedure last July. It went smoothly until she couldn't get all of it off and had to ask an assistant to go get a more powerful tool that she didn't think she would need to get the rest of it. 

Since then my vision in that eye has gotten worse and worse. I have had multiple follow ups and they just told me to keep using steroid drops for about 5 months until I was to ween off. I told them I was seeing double at times and my eye feels very weak. They would just do a vision test and say im back to my presurgery level of vision in that eye and act like that is good news. Then the last couple of visits they had me doing all of the eye test machines again which was getting expensive on my end. The latest conclusion is my cornea is too thin and I can't have any other surgery to correct my vision unless I go to Mexico or Canada since it wasn't allowed in the US. They still wanted me to come back every few months for the machine tests but I can't afford to keep doing that. They never warned me ahead of time that my vision could change completely or that if it did, I couldn't get it fixed. Should they have told me these things? Now I'm a year out and the eye is extremely blurry, dry, and I get pretty bad headaches. I use non preservative eye drops a lot but anything else I could be doing? I'm 2 years out of PRK and I really don't want to have to go back to depending on glasses or contacts. I am saving up to get a second opinion now.

gqp95e,Scintillating scotoma post Scleral Buckle,"So I had an encircling buckle + cryoplexy done for a chronic retinal detachment in my left eye back in October, 2019. I can live with the significant vision loss in the eye...(F....now 29) and after many consultations (ending up in the office of an amazing pediatric ophthalmologist....he has been so great!) I know that I will undoubtedly require Strabismus surgery on both eyes (and a partial buckle removal for an impinged ocular muscle) to regain some semblance of usable vision again (tentatively scheduled for late July of 2020!). 

However I have been experiencing what I assume (and has been tentatively labeled as per my pediatric ophthalmologist) is a very obvious scintillating scotoma. I have had the 'pleasure' of having 4 (as to be logically assumed as such) ocular migraines since December, 2019 (controlled by abortive measures,  i e. Propanol as prescribed by my GP). 


My current doctor(s) can't give me a definitive since he/they are typically working only with children....however I was referred to an adult retinal specialist in an associated practice, but the appointment has been postponed (understandably) for the time being. 

I guess my concern is regarding the possibility for long-term damage...if the scotoma issue could be (hopefully) addressed by another retinal specialist, and if not....is it something I could try to plan to see another dictator about (like a neurologist) in the near future? It's very difficult because I typically only experience the phenomena when my blood pressure spikes. I am nervous because I already have lost 50% of usable vision in my RD eye, so losing more could be very catastrophic for my future. 

I unfortunately am caught in the crosshairs of two major insurance companies having a long-term appendage measuring contest (Pennsylvania....UPMC vs Highmark) which means that I  have limited local options (having employer sponsored Highmark insurance), so it's fiscally responsible to try and ascertain my next steps (if possible) prior to taking them since our local medical system is so janky. 

TL;DR I have a scintillating scotoma appearing very noticeably whenever my blood pressure is elevated (post-encircling scleral buckle/band) and idk if it's something I should be perusing on the ophthalmology front or trying to secure a referral for a neurological consultation. I am typically a very active and outdoorsy person, however I keep getting hung up on the fear factor of possibly losing more eyesight when I have 'blackout' spots while being physically active.

 Of course, I will be asking about this question at my tentatively scheduled appointment in late June......

gqul9i,"Slowly going blind from Drusen/""visual snow""?","Hi.  This is a throwaway account as I would prefer to keep this anonymous.  Sorry if this gets long, also English isn't my first language so I  apologize for any mistakes.

Anyways.  I am a 20 y/o Norwegian woman suffering from Optic Nervehead Drusen. I  was diagnosed at the age of 13 after waking up one morning having lost  large parts of my vision overnight. I was completely terrified and was  rushed to hospital where they ruled out other possible causes for the  vision loss as Drusen do not typcially cause visual impairment, even  though it is possible in some rare cases.

What  is also quite remarkable is that the vision loss isn't only peripheral,  but affects several parts of my visual field, almost like a ""net"" of  sorts. Most doctors agree that this should not be possible. I have been  examined by many specialists, but none has been able to help me and most  are left perplexed by my progression. What started out as two blind  spots in my left eye, gradually evolved over the years and at age 15  both eyes were affected. Five more years have gone by and while I can't  see any radical changes for the worse, the spots are sort of moving  around, which i also find really strange and atypical for my condition.

My  mental health has been severely affected by this and since age 13 I've  been very depressed and anxious. It has caused me to withdraw socially  and I lack ambition in life. Seeing as I might go blind one day if this  carries on, I have abandoned all hope (sounds dramatic I know, but  living as a blind person seems terrifying and I would actually rather  die. No offense to blind people though, I truly admire those of you who  have the strength to create a dignified, decent life for yourselves  without sight). But I am too angry and afraid to get over it. Being the  pathetic creature I am, I would apparently rather dwell in my misery and  continue to hate myself and life itself for the rest of my days while  browsing suicide methods and having perpetual panic attacks (yes I am  seeing a therapist, and no it doesn't help).

Anyway.  Moving on. My left eye is currently the worst and if I hadn't my right  eye to compensate with, I would barely be able to read a book thanks to  the ""veil"" covering my eyesight, including peripheral and central  vision. Getting my driver's license will be a difficult thing to  accomplish, which is a bummer but hardly my biggest issue.

Also,  pretending that everything is alright is getting quite tiring and my  constant need to keep up the facade is hard to manage. I don't want  anyone to see me as a ""sick""/""disabled"" person, so the only people who  know about this are my parents. Not even my half siblings or friends are  aware of it and my parents are sworn to secrecy. Might sound  ridiculous, but I hate this part of myself and refuse to accept it, let  alone share it with the world. It is my private struggle.

What  do you people think? Any input would be helpful. I have read a lot  about the illness and the prognosis seems good, but on the other hand  I've already defied the ""normal"" progression by losing parts of my  vision, especially being this young. Those unfortunate souls who lose  parts of their vision thanks to Drusen usually lose it when they're  much, much older. Why is that? What makes me such a special case? Should  I fear losing all of my vision? Seven years have passed and I still  feel as upset and anxious about it. Please help me. I can't handle it. I  know I'm weak, but it has destroyed me to the core and taken my teenage  years away from me. I have no drive in life. I am completely absorbed  by my fears.

Also, I should  probably ad that I most likely suffer from undiagnosed moderate ""visual  snow/static"" that I've dealt with since as far as I can remember. It has  never been an issue though, it just kinda exists, you know and it  doesn't bother me, give me migraines or anything like that. But what's  interesting is that my blind spots look as if they are composed of  millions of those little grains/static particles or whatever you would  call them, so tightly packed together that they are non-see-through. The  patches also change colours and they started off as brown, but now  thyey are a more grayish/greenish/yellowish colour with different  pigmented static grains. It's just really weird and hard to describe.

Is  it possible that my vision loss is indeed a symptom of visual snow,  rather than Drusen? Does anyone out there have any clue what this might  be?

Hey [r/Ophthalmology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ophthalmology/),

Thanks for any of your insight! M, mid 20s, wears glasses around -5, and my degree hasn't changed for the past few years. Here's some helpful info:

1. I've had **floaters** (the pale strings) since I was around 15, and they've definitely broken down into smaller pieces over the past decade. If I look at a bright sky and move my eyes left and right quickly, I can notice the pale pieces swishing with it. It's not noticeable in medium lit areas or darker. I don't think it's ever made my day-to-day vision uncomfortable at all.
2. I've never had any random flashes in my life, but here's something that's been bothering me for a while: **if I look at my phone in a dark room at night before sleeping for a bit, and then close my eyes to sleep, I can see very fast flashes in the darkness that eventually fade away after 1-2 minutes of not looking at anything bright again.** Is this because of my phone's flickering frame rate or something?? Or are my retinas reacting adversely to the sudden change from brightness to darkness? I've found maybe 2 or 3 forums that have briefly talked about this but nothing conclusive was made. This is probably the most interesting thing that I'd like to know more about.
3. An **Optomap** my optometrist did for me last summer indicated both my retinas were healthy, as explained by him. Is this indicative of a healthy retina and not detachment, then? Or did my vitreous jelly just sort of shed when I was younger and now the floaters are persisting for the rest of my life?

My parents wear glasses too, one with super bad eyesight (like -8) and the other around -3. Neither of them have floaters or any other eye issues.

I’ve been experiencing a strange symptom for a few months now, and am hoping to hear what this sub thinks. I’m 26F with no preexisting health conditions that I’m aware of.

Sometimes, when I’m trying to sleep, I see “flashes” or “pulses” of diffused (almost black?) lights flickering in both eyes. I visited an optometrist in February who examined my eyes. My retinas and eye pressure were normal. No tears or signs of detachment in either retina. The optometrist didn’t seem concerned about these flashes and assured me that my eyes were healthy.

I am slightly myopic (-1.50 in both eyes) but my prescription has been stable for years. I don’t have eye pain or flashes during the day. These flashes happen more often when I’m stressed and have neck pain/tension.

So, if my eyes are healthy, can these flashes stem from a neurological issue? Every so often I see a bright flash of white light when I’m on the verge of sleep but this is a bit different.

Through all the failed surgeries of decades ago I'm left with an eye that still has oil in it for support, is blind and at substantially lower pressure.

The frequent pain I get from it is diagnosed as being caused by the uneven surface of my deflated eye collecting calcium from my eye moisture.

gvnbtd,"Pinguecula, prednisolone acetate, glaucoma and myopia? 32F","First off, thanks for reading this even after that scary subject line. 

This past winter in Africa I got a pinguecula in my left eye, on the side of my eye nearest my nose. 

I went to an optometrist when I was back in the states. She did an eye exam. I'm very, very nearsighted and have been since 3rd grade. Legally blind without vision correction. 

She diagnosed my pinguecula, and also did a deep scan of the interior of my eye. She told me my cones were on the larger side which could increase my chances for glaucoma later.

She gave me a Rx for Prednisolone Acetate Eyedrops and told me only to use it when my eye was irritated. I use it rarely, until recently. 

For the past week, my eye has been incredibly bloodshot - but on the opposite side. The side nearest my ear. It hurts a little bit when I blink. There's pressure behind my eye, it feels like pressure on my skull. I used the Prednisolone Acetate about three times but it's not helping. Just googled my symptoms and it sounds like glaucoma. 

After some research, I read that P.A. can actually trigger glaucoma AND that P.A. shouldn't be used if you are severely nearsighted. 

Was my optometrist wrong to prescribe me with this, since I have myopia and am a likely candidate for glaucoma later in life? Or is it really okay as long as you don't use it often?

In your experience, does it sound like I could have glaucoma?

gw7ca3,DRY EYES - My experience. Looking for suggestions for dryness / contacts / treatments,"Hi everyone,

Hopefully I can get some suggestions here as I’ve been battling dry eyes for almost 2 years now. 

I’m 22. I used to wear contacts all the time until one day I started getting bloodshot eyes and eventually it began harder to wear the contacts as long. 

I ended up going to the eye doctor and then the ophthalmologist. Drops helped a good amount at first, I wouldn’t leave the house without them. However it didn’t make the problem go away. We tried warm compresses, lid cleaners, Xiidra, punctal plugs, Omega 3 supplements at first. None really seemed to work.

Ended up switching ophthalmologists and got a new diagnosis that it could be blepharitis (eyelid inflammation) contributing to the dryness. I definitely think keeping the eyelid clean contributes to the overall dryness of my eye but still I feel this dryness and I’m not sure what to do. 

While I mostly wear my glasses now unless playing sports or going out for a few hours, I do really want to wear my contacts more. I wear Dailies Total 1 which are supposed to be one of the best for dry eyes but my eyes still seem to get uncomfortable anywhere between 30 mins and two hours. Are there any other contacts any of you would suggest?

Right now I try to do warm compresses every morning and night, clean my eyelids once a day with a cleanser, and take Omega 3 supplements. I feel like using eye drops just ends up making me rely on them too much and makes them feel even more dry when I don’t put any in. 

I was considering treatments like Lipiflow or IPL but they are kind of expensive and there is no guarantee they will help. The goal before all this was to get Lasik but it’s probably a bad move until I can get the dry eyes under control. 

I know this is a long explanation but hopefully someone reads it and could help. At least I have my experience written down now which will be useful. 

Any help with the dry eye issues, experiences you’ve had, contact suggestions, Lasik, etc. would be super appreciated.

gwko2v,Post-retinal tear laser treatment floaters,"Hi, everyone.  43-year-old M patient here.

Last week I visited an opthamologist (ER) following the sudden appearance of floaters and flashes in my right eye days earlier.  This was preceded by trauma near the eye (hit in the side of the face with a soccer ball).

Examination revealed a small tear and small hole in right eye, which necessitated laser treatment (can't remember the name of the procedure but at one point I had a contact lens placed in the eye).  There was topical freezing with drops and dilation involved).

Four days later, and aside from muscle strain from the prodding and looking to the extreme right during the process, it feels like the floaters are persisting.  I wouldn't necessarily say it's worse, but the webs, small dots and general blurriness ( I am 20/20) persists, including sensitivity to light.

As I was urged to go through emerg on the weekend, there wasn't much time to discuss recovery.  Is it fairly typical for the floaters to persist?  Do these heal with time?  Could anyone elaborate on  the procedure as a whole?

gwoly5,On and off blurry vision in one eye for months,"I'm a 23 year old healthy female. So, to preface this, I've been wearing glasses since I was 2 and contacts exclusively for 7 years until this past december when I got diagnosed with dry eye. Now I mainly wear glasses. My prescription is udpated but I've been having some weird symptoms. 

I also want to mention that I DO have horner's syndrome in my right eye (diagnosed by neuro opthamologist with eye drop test) and according to pictures I've had the small pupil and slight droopiness for atleast 4 years (could be longer, I never used to take pics of my face before then). The actual diagnosis was only recently receieved due to the vision problems I've been having starting around the time I switched to glasses. My neuro did a head MRI/MRA/MRV and neck MRI/MRA/MRV and found nothing. I've also had a clear CT scan of my chest last year for something unrelated (thought I'd mention bc I know it can be chest related). They said it is probably nothing to worry about since I've had it so long and often times horner's can't be explained. However, ever since I switched back to glasses (I've been doing contacts every once in a while and trying to ease back into them) everyday I get bouts of blurry vision in one of my eyes. Even If I take off my glasses I can just tell that that one eye is blurry and not focused. Usually it occurs in mid lighting and in the eye that has the larger pupil. I've also recently started getting headaches (this year) and the neuro has done many tests and thinks I'm fine. The fact that they don't think I should worry should make me feel better but doesn't for some reason. 

I've tried to explain to multiple doctors that I have a blurrier eye at times (usually the left but sometimes the right) and it is really annoying but they seem to dismiss me. The eye doctor seemed confused. I think it might be related to the horner's because when the neuro did the diagnostic test, the blurriness that I'd been having shifted sides when the test kicked in for a positive result (a positive test = after the drops the enlarged pupil and ptosis switches sides). I talked to my neuro about this and she said that horners could probably cause the visual discrepancy but did not seem concerned or offer any solutions. It's just weird to me because it is not consistently happening and seems to appear randomely throughout the day, sometimes lasting hours or minutes. It also never occurred during the earlier years of my horner's (I was wearing contacts exclusively though). If I wear contacts I USUALLY do not experience this, which makes me wonder if it has to do with my switch to glasses? This all appeared around the time I started wearing glasses consistently. 

Should I be worried? This has been plaguing my mind and giving me extreme anxiety. The horners diagnosis really freaked me out. The doc said that maybe it could have been caused by a horseback riding injury (I've had many) or some genetic thing (my great aunt and grandma both have/had it but it was caused by benign and harmless ""shwanomas"" on their cervical spine. and my scans didn't target the spine I don't think so who knows) It's also odd to me because my mom and twin sister (fraternal) both have pretty drastic anisocoria but have no type of diagnosis or anything.",1,0,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/gwoly5/on_and_off_blurry_vision_in_one_eye_for_months/"")",2020-06-04 12:43:42,

So I have been wearing glasses for 15 years now (I'm 22F, -7.5 and -8.5 prescription) and I wanted to start wearing contacts last winter.
So I got 3 pairs of contacts in November and started to use it like once or twice a week.

It's not super red but it's pretty red and becomes slightly better when I go out and everything but when I'm inside or when I just wake up or after a shower it gets very red. I have no other problems such as irritation/pain etc

So I went to 4 ophthalmologists before and they all did a slit lamp check up and said that it looked fine only and that they can't seem to find the reason that it's red. They gave me a few drops but those didn't really work.

I went to another ophthalmologist 4 days back and she's a cornea specialist. She did a slit lamp check after putting some kind of drop in my eye and said that I have viral conjunctivitis and allergic conjunctivitis.
She gave me 4 kinds of drops and said that I have to put those in 4 times a day.

&amp;#x200B;

I was diagnosed with OR in early Feb. instructed on occuscrub / eye hygiene, preservative-free lubricant drops, omega 3 (chia seeds and fish oil daily) and put on just an antibiotic (skipped steroid due to one incidence of herpes zoster when I was 13 (24 y/o male now). 

My left (bad) eye has optic nerve damage from a MV accident when I was 17. So of course my good (right) eye is very important to me and i'm sensitive to changes / need to preserve it's health and avoid scarring. 

I had multiple visits to my gen. opth over last 2 months and at times was told ""it may take some time to work out a good plan for you, etc."" when in fact I wasn't impatient about the nagging but tolerable physical sensation side effects, but am scared of ulcer scarring. 

had a larger flare up about a month ago that she put me on tobradex for. 

was also put on 40 mg doxycycline 1 x / day a few appointments into this ideal just before lockdown started in mid march - seemed to help overall at first but now seems to have less effect. 

I do probably 10 different individual eye-care related things a day for this, and that is what it is, but my issue is: **I may be a worrier, but it should make sense that I can't take any risks with this eye. Whereas the doctors understandably have to take conservative measures and allocate time across their many patients - many of whom probably see worse than I do at 24. At the same time, my next appointment with what I believe to be a ""higher tier"" ophthalmologist isn't until july 15th.** 

I've had a flare up the last few day (linked some photos - one from last night and 3 from this AM where it looks better). Often times due to the probable MGD involved in the pathology of this issue, the resulting visual disruption from poor tear film causes tension / soreness in orbital area of the eye. However, in the case of this recent flare up - which does seem to be improving today vs yesterday - the proximity of that red patch close to the iris causes me a lot of anxiety, and there is some discomfort / probable minor light sensitivity. 

&amp;#x200B;

I called the office of the doctor I'm going to see in mid july to explain that I'm having a flare up and can they move me up / I'm uncertain of where the line is where I should act and be seen + get steroids to avoid scarring. She said someone will call me back within 24-48 hours but my initial appt. was already moved up due to the referral I got and they are generally booking out through next october. 

&amp;#x200B;

**In short, I'm at an important stage of my life and have had a lot of other health issues in the past. I can handle ""ignoring"" discomfort, but having had to very minor peripheral ulcers from this in the last 3 months - in both cases the doctor didn't actually use the word ulcer in the appt. with me but I saw it in her notes from the meetings - and am sort of losing it. I'm trying to apply to grad school and get my life started and that involves lots of focusing and screen time, etc. I feel like i'm being torn between hurting my eye permanently with scars and hunkering down to do the hard work I've been avoiding since I graduated college several years ago.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**I know this is a lot to unload via a reddit post, but I guess if someone can take a look at those imgur photos and tell me if I need to push harder / go to the eye ER, etc. then I can have some direction**

gz6sg6,Question about my eyes' condition since it is not possible to see an eye doctor in my country except for critical cases due to Covid-19 measures.,"Hi everyone, I understand that it is not possible to diagnose someone over the internet but I would nevertheless immensely appreciate any of your thoughts on my situation. I am not able to see an eye doctor because due to corona measures in my country hospitals are only seeing patients in critical cases.   
I am 26 years old male, I don't wear glasses and my eye sight till recently has been -.05 and -1.25. Since about Christmas I noticed that my eyesight has been diminishing rather profoundly. I know this because each week I would sit in about the same spot, in the first row, for my lectures. I started noticing that from week to week I became less able to read the math that the lecturer would write on the blackboard. To the point that since about the beginning of April I wasn't able anymore to read the formulas. At that this point I also started feeling what I would describe as constant discomfort, mild pain in my right eye, also my eyes were rather always dry. That's when I went to my GP, told my situation and asked to be referred to an eye doctor. My GP however declined to refer my to an eye doctor and told me to take out glasses. I went to get glasses and was quite surprised because my vision test said that my eye sight was -0.75 and -1.5. Which seemed to me as a very mild decrease in my vision as compared to how much less I was actually able to see in reality. Then the Covid-19 hit. In the months of April and May my vision has decreased what I would describe severely. With my right eye, if I close my left one, I can see very little comparable to 2 months or before Christmas. For example, I am about 4 meters away from my kitchen counter and everything just seems blurry, I can make out the shape of the 1l glass olive oil bottle and other things on the counter, but it is all I can see, the shape, even the kitchen cabins and the wall seems blurry and I actually cannot quite see the dinner plate that is on the counter.   
Further my right eye has been in pain for the most of the last 2 months and I mean in substantial pain, I feel it inside the eye and around the eye. I basically recently had to stop using my computer for the last 4 days for the pain to go away.   
I also feel that without taking into account the quality of the eyesight of my right eye, altogether the perimeter/diameter of my right eye vision, when left eye is closed, has become smaller and is certainly smaller as compared to my left eye's vision's perimeter/diameter. Like to the side of the eye I feel I can see altogether less then how much I can see to the side of the eye w.r.t my left eye.   
When I look into a white wall now I don't see the white wall per se, but I see colorful dots everywhere. I didn't use to see that.   
My right feels heavy, sort of like if it was a ""lazy eye"", but I know it is not, as I looked in the mirror. In the right eye I feel this particular discomfort the way my eyelid sits on my eye when I close. With the left eye it just fits, but with the right eye I just feel like it doesn't sit properly.   
I talked with my friend who has eye vision -2 in both eyes. And apparently they don't use glasses for their laptop, but now I actually feel like I am not able to read stuff on my laptop clearly anymore without glasses. Letters seem a bit blurry, this is certainly the case if I try to read something for an hour or so on my laptop. In general eyes just get very tired very quickly and feel very heavy. And I feel like I have to squint all the time.   
Till about \~2 weeks ago I felt that all these things were happening to my right eye only and the left one was fine. But now my left eye also has started hurting inside the eye and around the eye after I had to work extensively for several days with a computer. I also feel that since then the eye sight in my left eye has also been declining. I also developed substantial pain just below the left eye after extensively working for a few days with a computer, it felt like tense string for a lack of a better word.

gzr3mh,20 Year Old - Uneven Eyesight?,"Hello all!

I'm a 20 year old male, no health problems. Plant based diet. Live in Los Angeles.

If I close my right eye and look through my left, and vice versa, things look farther away in my left. Say a cup is 2 feet away from me and I look through my left, it looks 3 feet away. Or a sign when driving is 10 feet away, and I look through my left eye only, it looks 12-15ft away. Nothing is blurry, just looks far away. Does anybody know if this is normal? Am I just nearsighted or farsighted?

I'm pretty sure I've always had this but in September, 9 months ago, I was in a car crash where the car hit me on my left side going 60mph (He ran a red light). Could this be connected at all? But again, pretty sure I've had this for awhile, just I'm not paying attention to it.

After spending too much time reading on this in quarantine (lol), I’ve established that:

- right eye is higher (seems so in photos, when looking afar, and actually also confirmed through a Maddox rod test once) - interestingly, on the cover uncover test it seems that the image from the left eye is higher (is this even possible???) 
- diplopia in right gaze, right eye is also higher in right gaze 
- right eye also higher when looking up and to the right
- no massive difference in relation to incyclo excyclo torsion 
- left head tilt with associated SCM and trapezius pain

So if you are still reading this, thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to hear me out here:) I am looking for insights/advise . I understand that going to the eye doc is the best thing to do, but with the ongoing situation, I wanted to know If it can wait.

So over the past couple of months I have had moderate to severe anxiety which manifested in a whole range of symptoms from a lot of facial muscle tension to dysphagia. Thankfully, most of it is gone now and so has my anxiety. But over the past couple of weeks, my eyes have been acting up. I have had pain in my right eye, extreme dryness, and general weakness. Recently, my eyes had started feeling like they had been exposed to really bright light - I'm not quite sure how to explain how it feels. All these symptoms have gotten better. But over the last week, I have noticed that my vision change. In partial darkness, I'm able to see less clearly, and during the day, my vision has become more dim. I got checked out by an opthalmologist just before this started happening and all he said was I was having digital strain and gave me lubricatig drops. Could the dimness be because of my eye strain or is it something else?

Some background: I'll be honest, I havent had the best eye habits. All of my work is on the computer, and I have worked long hours on the the system over the past decade, well into the night.

He examined my eyes and said yea only on the right one.  I also let him know that I saw this tiny white pimple like thing on my plica semilunaris ( upon doing some research online I think that's what the area is called )
I didn't know the term when I was at the doctors office at the time.
At first he didn't see it and then when he looked again he said oh,"" that's common when something gets in your eye that the eye doesn't like"" and he said a medical term for it starting with either a ""c"" or a ""k"" and I am not sure but it sounded more like the word started with a ""c"". 

Does anyone know what he meant or what any pimple like thing on the plica semilunaris?


[Here's a picture of it](https://imgbox.com/R8IsQXiO)


I was prescribed tobramyacin/dexamethasone for 5 days ,( 1 drop 3x a day) and ketorolac (1 drop twice a day as needed). Since the ketorolac wasn't available at the pharmacy at the time, I didn't get it until later. I also hesitated because of side effects, but I have it now.

Can anyone tell what this is on my eye and what is the best treatment? 

I am on day 4 of just taking  tobramyacin/ dexamethasone and still feel pain. I do plan to see another doctor soon when I can get an appointment.

If this thing contains pus in it, could I put like a warm compress/ heating pad on my eye?

h0v5e9,Fixing strabismus/lazy eye on adult?,"Hi! I am 20 and have had what I was told was a lazy eye since I was about 8 or 9. I was cross eyed as a baby and had corrective surgery for that when I was 2, and have had glasses ever since. As a child I was always far sighted, but eventually my left eye started drifting outward and my right eye became more near sighted. I went to eye therapy for a period as a child but it didn’t seem to help so my parents stopped taking me. As a teenager my eyes got worse to the point that my left eye is slightly far sighted (for the most part I can see fine except with extremely close up things that I can see fine with my right eye), my right eye is extremely near sighted (anything more than maybe 5 feet is blurry, sometimes even less distance), and my eyes do not work together at all causing one eye to drift always (right eye drifts if I look at something far away, left eye drifts for closer objects). The drift is fairly significant, most people assume I am not looking at them, it’s almost always visible in pictures, and even with glasses or contacts it happens.

For years I’ve been told at eye exams there’s nothing that can be done, but I’ve lately been experiencing a lot of eye strain and headache, and I’ve struggled to get a drivers license to due my difficulties with depth perception and peripheral vision. I hate how my eyes don’t work properly, and am afraid of the drift worsening over time. I’ve never met with an ophthalmologist before and have been researching about surgery for a while now.

h7cr1w,Can't focus either eye when one's closed? + Vision goes dark/hard to focus with non dominant eye when dominant eye is closed?," 

Hi, so I recently, about 3 months ago, updated my glasses with a prescription I received about 6 months prior to that. At the time I asked for a slightly ""uncorrected"" prescription as that usually feels more comfortable to me. The glasses where uncomfortable at first, but I felt I just had to get used to them.

What I didn't notice before was that my left eyes myopia must have been getting worse. With the new glasses i can see just fine for the most part with both eyes wide open. But as soon as I close either eye I can barely read anything even 10 feet away. My eyes just don't want to focus for whatever reason.

What is worse is that with my dominant right eye closed, I can BARELY see with my left eye, within a second of closing my right eye I start to see the red inside of my eyelid as it comes into ""focus"" ultimately turning my vision from my left eye dark. I have to blink to ""clear it up"".

Last time I went to the optometrist, and even the time before that probably a year before I had a lot of trouble focusing my vision with one eye closed on that device where you focus on a center dot and press the button when you see waving lines to the sides. My vision just kept going dark and I had to keep blinking, I told the assistant I was having trouble but they just had me retry it.

Other focusing issues I've noticed is I've become MUCH more aware of dirt or smudging on my lenses, my last pair could be horribly dirty and i wouldn't mind, these I get a fingerprint or some dust I will continue to notice it especially when looking at a screen.

Another weird possibly unrelated thing is the floaters, since the amount of time I spend outside has been very limited the past few months, I notice TONS of floaters as I'm walking or sitting outside, look at the sky floaters. I think this goes hand in hand with light sensitivity I feel like I've experienced getting worse in the past year.

I don't know, I'm just very concerned about my vision being that I'm only 19 and have a high prescription about -6, with i believe my left eyes prescription being possibly -6.5.

hafynw,"Strobe light flash triggered by light, pressure, and standing up","In 2019 I had my first flare up of posterior uveitis and chorioretinitis,  which has been under control with medication for 1.5 years. My initial symptoms before treatment were very large strobe light flashes when going from dark to bright and floaters. For 6 months on prednisone I didn't really have any flashes and the medication worked. However, about a year ago, when I was tapering off prednisone and onto cyclosporine, I got this new spot in my left eye that has been there ever since. It's a little larger than the size of my fist when my arm is extended. It strobes/flashes black and white, has defined borders, is circular, and is always stationary. 

For some reason it's triggered by 3 things: going from dark to bright lighting, rubbing my eye, and sometimes if I'm lying down or sitting for a while then suddenly stand up. All 3 produce the same effect. It happens for a few seconds each time, maybe 5+ times a day depending on triggers. 

How are these 3 different things triggering the exact same flashin, strobe light circle?? Is it leftover damage from the inflammation?

I didn't know where to go with such a question and thought Reddit could be the right place.

He's diagnosis is glaucoma, his retina suffered a lot. His crystalline lens was changed and his vision formally is  -1 or -2. However, he almost can't see due to the fact that the retina died on the periphery.

For Russian doctors, that's a diagnosis no one will work with. I am an outsider to medicine and have no idea about the current med-tech state in this field. I would be very grateful if someone could explain to me if there's anything we can do with such a diagnosis.

I'm 33, M. Around last Wednesday I noticed some ""after image"" bursts of light while watching TV, and just generally everywhere there was a lighter source. I went in for an eye exam 2 days ago and with an Optomap machine my optometrist found the following:

""Choroidal nevus about 2DD oval with distinct borders at 12 o clock in mid periphery. Hole at 4 o clock in far periphery with surrounding floaters.""

I received a referral letter and saw an ophthalmologist yesterday at Kaiser. They dilated my eyes and did their own exam which confirmed what my optometrist had found. The doctor told me then that he would have me be seen by their retinal specialist next Wednesday the 24th (I was under the impression this was the retinal specialist and that it would be addressed then but it was their own consultation). 

It's been almost 24 hours since my eyes were dilated and this morning I woke up with my left eye a little bit blurrier than yesterday. I'm still seeing those after image flashes.

hcep21,Constant fear of retinal detachment.,"
Not looking for any diagnosis but in a time needing support.
I'm 23(M) and high myope (-6.00). In the past 2 months I have experienced floaters/flashes which have resulted in 5 (small) retinal tears. I've probably been to the ophthalmologist 6 times during this time. First time was 1 small tear which had a bit of lifting next to a blood vessel and the other 4 were discovered on a different day although smaller compared to first and more in the periphery with the vitreous still attached. All have been lasered. Everytime my vitreous changes there's a tear.

I'm constantly in fear and thinking in the next 50 years there may be a time where I may miss a symptom and it'd be too late.

I'm trying to look on the bright side wherever possible. 5 retinal tears? Atleast I caught them in time. I know what to look out for, plus if I have had laser done in those areas they would form good adhesion reducing risks of RD starting from those areas in the future etc. My doctor is one of the top in his field but he is 1 hour away from me which makes visiting him for every so frequent flash I experience exhausting but mandatory.

How to cope?

hcp3gt,Question about Severe Myopia,"I have severe myopia (-8.00) in each eye with astigmatism. I began wearing contacts in high school (don’t remember what my prescription was when i started) but it has increased almost yearly. The last two years it’s remained at -8.00 however. Each year I jokingly ask my optometrist if I’m going to go blind and they always say no it’ll stabilize... but I’m almost 32. I feel like it should have stabilized by now?

Unfortunately today I came across an article on retinal detachment and am now very concerned as this elevated risk has never been discussed with me.

I guess what I want to know is— how do I know if my myopia is indeed progressive/degenerative/pathological?

Does the fact that it’s generally getting worse every couple years mean it is?

If it is progressive/degenerative/pathological, does that mean I will eventually go blind?

Is -8.00 all that concerning?

I saw an optometrist twice, then a retina specialist, and an ophthalmologist, each three times.  I've also posted here several times.

And I've accepted and followed the advice I've been give by each doctor, and here, and appreciate every reply.

My last appointment was with a retina specialist six months ago, who said I didn't need to return unless I saw the tell-tale ""curtain.""  He said I may even see what looks like new hemorrhages, but without the ""curtain"" it would likely be the collected blood from previous bleeds just moving around.  

It's been six months, and the blood has slowly disappeared (been absorbed) to the point I can see fine, but there was still a small(er) pool of blood in the top of my visual field.

Yesterday, six months since the last hemorrhage and visit with the retina specialist, I had what I think was another hemorrhage.  The blood is mostly gone from my visual field, but I'm really worried.  I thought this nightmare was over, even though the remaining pooled blood was still present, although reduced every month.

My ophthalmologist as of a month ago wasn't seeing patients unless it was an emergency.  I've got a call into his office, but haven't yet received a reply.

Edit:  I am not diabetic.

Bottom line:  Is my experience that atypical?  Can I assume/hope it's just the remnant blood that hasn't been absorbed yet, or is this a new hemorrhage, and I need a vitrectomy, or something more serious?

I was sitting at my computer and very suddenly my right eye became very light sensitive and then I these giant color blocks obscured my vision along with clouds in my periphery. I couldn't read or see any details but my vision remained basically the same as far as focus is concerned.

He said the treatment options were basically a last resort rather than what they go to first. He also said because I'm young and don't have any risk factors I should recover fairly quickly (few weeks).

It's always a little bit below the center of the visual field, not more than 5° away.

The figure looks like a segment of a blood vessel, the brightest part is perceptibly tortuous and the edges of this seem to continue to something that doesn't get revealed during the flash.

I used a flashlight at the border of my vision to see the shadows of the blood vessels in my retina (constantly wobbling the flashlight to keeping them from fading away) and I tried to see if there was anything glaringly wrong, but it looks normal.

I don't know if that could reveal anything unless if it was really catastrophic, but at least I know nothing is so wrong.

I also did some blind spot checks (in both eyes) to see if there were any new blind spots or obscured regions near the center of my vision (I could only cover a radius of 30° around the center) and I only found the blind points that were supposed to exist.

Is there any reason I should still be worried?

Should I fear some vascular problem due to that figure or that isn't indicative of anything by itself?

heka8v,Full spectrum CBD and high IOP - concerned,"I know this is a tough question as the study is new and there haven’t been more. But I wanted to get some feedback on CBD and glaucoma. I don’t have glaucoma, but my eye pressure runs boarder line high so they check it and a few other vision tests every visit.

The study shows CBD alone (in eye drop form) raises pressure. Studies show that THC + CBD lowers pressure - is the THC in full spectrum enough for this effect? Any first hand accounts from people who take CBD and have high IOP already, or at least get checked frequently?

It helps my anxiety a lot, but not worth blindness. Wondering also if it’s only dangerous if it’s daily dosing, or maybe I could reduce doses etc. any feedback appreciated!

I’ve been dealing with floaters for 2 years now. Always checked up on them to make sure there wasn’t any underlying issue causing them. Retina seemed fine and my optometrist told me it was probably bc of my near-sightness and age. I’m only 26 years old but okay whatever. I went to 2 other doctors for more opinions and they all said my eyes were fine. Fast forward to May 2020 when I started noticing flashes too. Every time I move my right eye, I can see like this circle outline of a flash. In places with bright lights I see halos around people and I feel like I can see two bright spots in the center of my vision. It goes away when I blink, but it’s very scary. I also started getting frequent headaches, bad eye pain, and like my eyes get shaky when I try to focus. They’ve been twitching like crazy lately. My neurologist ordered an MRI for me , and it came back with no abnormalities. So he thinks it’s just migraines. My ophthalmologist said my optic nerves looked “suspicious” and my eye pressure was borderline glaucoma levels but everything else seemed okay. He even sent me to a retina specialist who didn’t see any tears. The retina specialist wants to see me in September and my ophthalmologist in December. I’m just super confused and the neuro-ophthalmologist is my last hope to see what’s causing these eyes changes. I don’t want to lose my eyesight.

I went home and got some more sleep, but when I woke up, my left eye was clearly not opening as wide as it did before. I called the ophthalmologist about this, and he said my eyes looked quite healthy, and he didn't see anything wrong. Also that the body sometimes does things and for me to just sleep it off.

heo0nd,"Machine says I have astigmatism, doctor says I don't?","Hi All,

I went to the Wal Mart optical center today to get an eye exam and encountered difficulties with the A / B comparison tests. The doctor asked me for my preferences between text on red background vs text on green backgrounds and it was difficult to pick on over the other from some slides. My biggest problem was that on some slides, I can clearly make out the text, but I would see a shadow of the same characters immediately above the text I'm reading. My response baffled the doctor and she claims that she needs to know whether my response could be trusted. After spending roughly 35 minutes trying the slides over and over, the doctor claims that I do not have astigmatism, contrary to what the machine reported. In her own words ""the machine shows that you have all sorts of astigmatism"".

I find this to be somewhat confusing, since all my previous doctors had prescribed me lenses for astigmatism and for near-sightedness.

I think the doctor's patience ran out towards and end, and she hurriedly wrote a proscription for -2.25 OD and -2.50 OS for me and sent me on my way. My personal opinion was that the lenses she had me try on did not offer very significant improvements over my current pair. Is something amiss? Should I just order glasses with her prescription?

I recieved like 4 droplets so it can grow the size of my pupil. Am also sensible to harsh light like camera flashes and phone lantern light. I also experience negative after image, visual snow in the dark and palinopsia in the dark with sources of light. The Dr. used a machine to watch into my pupils that used bright light and it bothered my a lot she turned to the minimum when she saw that it bothered me. I looked directly into the light and she said to look at her ear not at the light i stared at the light for like 4 seconds or so. Since yesterday i noticed a new shape of irregular form like little bubbles on my left eyes appearing when i turn on the light. It disappears quickly but every time when i switch the light or looking at a source of light like a screen quickly with my left eye i can see the bright irregular shape form little bubbles there. The after negative image effect is also more aggressive since the test. I'm using glasses with -0.5 left and -0.5 right.

hev72h,ghosting/auras around text - doctors can’t find solution or cause,"I’ve been dealing with a persistent issue that no doctor has figured out yet. For over a year, I’ve noticed ghosting around text (white text on black bg) and glowing/auras around text (black text on white bg). It’s most noticeable with text because of the sharply-defined lines. I started to see it while watching movies and seeing streaking during credits and ghosting/drop shadows on subtitles. This occurs at all distances though. It’s pretty difficult for me to read because I’m focused on trying to make the letters look clear (so comprehension suffers). Most noticeable when reading books (digitally and on paper), but it’s at all distances. I don’t know how to drive but I wouldn’t feel safe driving if I did know how (street signs aren’t fully clear). I have to concentrate on just physically reading letters in ways I have never experienced before.

I’m not seeing blur - it isn’t softness as much as this slight doubling (though it’s not exactly doubling either). There have been some photos in past posts that are closer to what I see - drop shadows behind text (white on black) and glowing (black on white)

I have an astigmatism and fairly strong prescription. Most recent script is 8.50 sph, +1.75 cyl in both eyes, right axis 104, left axis 77. 

I’ve tried getting progressives, reading glasses, multiple attempts at distance frames, eye drops for slightly large pupils, and artificial tears. Nothing seems to help. I have the same issues with eye charts at the doctor’s office - I can make out what most of the letters are to about 20/20, but it’s difficult and they look streaky/weird. Not crisp like I remember from all my years in eye appointments.

I went for a laser eye consult and was turned down because it’s unlikely laser will correct the issue I’m facing. All my scans seem to come out normal and my eyes seem healthy to the doctors (ophthalmologists, optometrists).

I’m going to investigate hard contacts next, and hopefully get a referral to a neuro-ophthalmologist.

I am an artist and photographer, so clarity of vision is top of mind. I’ve never experienced anything like this before, and have worn glasses since around age 6. Even though I have a fairly strong prescription, I’ve always been able to see clearly with glasses - until the last year or so.

I’m really at a loss! Sometimes it feels like I’m making this up, but my vision hasn’t felt right for a while now. Has anyone experienced something similar or heard of these issues before?

To give a bit of history:

1. In Summer 2018, I went to an ophthalmologist who told me I had a bacterial pink eye infection. He told me to use Vigamox 4 times a day for 7 days, and then when that didn't work, he gave me Tobradex, which eventually helped. It took almost a month to return my eyes to normal.
2. In Winter 2019, I went to an optometrist for a similar problem, who also told me I had a bacterial pink eye. He gave me Tobradex, and it went away after at most 2 weeks.
3. About 2 weeks ago, I got another infection. I didn't want to jump to conclusions again (stupidly on my part). I decided to use warm and cool compresses, and artificial tears in the event the infection was viral or allergic. Nothing helped.
4. So, 1 week ago, I went to a Walkin-Doctor, who looked at my eye and told me I have a bacterial infection. He gave me Vigamox, and after about 7 days using 3 drops per day, nothing has changed.

My symptoms include:

1. Pink eye
2. Extremely watering
3. Yellow, sticky discharge when I wake up, and a bit throughout the day.
4. Sensitive to sunlight
5. And as of this morning, I struggle to keep my eye open (As if I am sleepy and forcing myself to keep awake).

My questions are these:

1. Should I go to the emergency room in the hospital?
2. Should I keep using the Vigamox and hope something good happens?
3. Any other advice or suggestions?

hfzmzt,New stye almost every week. HELP,"I have been getting styes since I was a little girl. I am 26 now.

I got them very frequently in grade and middle school - I’d say once a month. Thank goodness they slowed down in high school in college and I would get maybe 1-2 a year.

I have recently started to get them very frequently again. In the past 4 months, I have been averaging 3-4 styes a month. In March, I had 4 styes at one time. 3 in one eye and 1 in the other. I saw a ophthalmologist and she told me I needed to cleanse my eyelid every night which I have been doing.

I do wear contacts, and am very clean when I take out and put them in. I wash my hands frequently and am very good about not touching my eyes. I hardly ever wear make up. I do have severe allergies.

I do not believe cleansing my eyelids has been helping, if anything it has just been drying out my skin.

I believe my styes are being caused by my eyelashes - is this possible? I have always had VERY long, thin eyelashes. They grow like weeds, and they often grow out of line with the others. I have noticed when I pluck the eyelashes around the infected area, the pain often subsides a little. When I pluck the lashes, they come out with gunk on the end and often the ones where the infection is - they come out very thick on the other end. They almost look like the end of a Bobby pin or when you pull a hairbrush bristle out.

The current stye I have, I noticed the eyelash was a lot lower than the rest of my lashes and when I plucked it I felt like that was the lash that was causing the infection.

I am becoming very frustrated with these reoccurring styes as they are very painful and unsightly.

Can anyone offer me any advice or suggestions on treatment for me to do at home or present to my ophthalmologist?

hgd3gf,"Does my symptoms warrant emergency visit? Already diagnosed w/ optic disc pit, posterior staphyloma, undefined congenital anomaly of optic nerve.","Will try to keep this as short as possible. I have a rare congenital defect in my left eye that affects my optic nerve, along with an optic disc pit and posterior staphyloma. I can only see out of the bottom half of that eye. I am working with an excellent ophthalmologist (president of MGH-affiliated practice)  who took on my case a couple of years ago because of the unusual complexities. The eye has never caused me any discomfort (nor was I told to expect any) up until about 1 month ago. I was never prescribed any drops or other form of treatment since there's really nothing confirmed that would be likely to help - they've just been monitoring to see how soon I'll lose all my vision in that eye, which I've already accepted and come to terms with. 

Backstory aside: I started experiencing a feeling of increased pressure in the left eye about 1 month ago, barely noticeable at first. It was accompanied by an occasional twitching sensation. Over the past week, the pressure sensation has gotten gradually worse. My field of vision in that eye seems a bit worse than normal, but it's never been good, so it's hard to tell exactly how much worse it is (my right eye compensates). The past three nights, I have had a tough time falling asleep because the pressure is now accompanied by a feeling of grittiness behind the eye. Shutting the eye feels worse than keeping it open; when shut, it feels like it twitches like crazy and the pressure is worse. It's also painful to look hard in any one direction with that eye. 

I already called my ophth's office and made an appointment for 2 weeks from now. I am also moving to a new apartment next week. Basically, I'm trying to figure out if there's anything I can use OTC or otherwise to make the discomfort less noticeable/help me sleep until my appointment so I can just get through this move – or, whether I should see a different doctor ASAP. Already tried Visine, only made it worse. Ibuprofen does nothing. 

TLDR; experiencing weird eye pressure/grittiness/discomfort but no obvious changes to vision. Previously diagnosed with rare congenital defect in that eye.

So this has been happening since the beginning of quarantine in March. Since I'm home all day I spent all of my days and nights on my computer or phone.

I always try to control the shine, I turn on the ""night"" screen feature, I wear sunglasses when I'm out. The only thing that makes me feel better is going out to the garden to read a bit. But the minute I comeback to the pc the dizziness comes back. I'm getting scared because it's strong dizziness but I have school exams so I cannot not be on the computer.

I also took blood tests a few months ago and everything was ok, I always take my vitamins. The only thing that changed was being home all day on the computer that's why I think that's that.

Well, things got much worse in the last 2 weeks and my eyelids and skin below (bags?) were so swollen all day. Went to doc who took my bloods and diagnosed probable over active thyroid and/or Graves disease. 

She gave me medication to tide me over till I see a specialist (endocrinologist) in a few weeks and sent me to an emergency A&amp;E hospital specifically for eyes and ears. After waiting three hours the medical student doc did measurements on my eyes to make sure there was no bulging and basically sent me away with lubricating eye drops. He said I will need to see another eye doc who may give me steroids. He said he couldn't give me them because he was only A&amp;E (?)

Anyway, while my general feelings of illness (from the thyroid problem) is easing off due to the medication, my eyes are worse than ever. They are now bloodshot in the mornings and there is  gel-like yellowish mucus in them. In the mornings they are crusty. The swelling has now progressed to my inner eye lids.

So, my question is, is this normal for hyperthyroidism or should I contact my doc and ask her to send me to a private eye doctor (which will cost maybe €200).

I'm a high myope (-11). I was seen by two ophthalmologists and was told it was PVD.

Since I'd only had the injury three days prior at that point, at the time I didn't think to ask 'what about the pain?', but now, 10 days after the injury, I'm still getting pain, especially when I move my eye. Can anyone suggest what might still be giving me pain, as I'm aware that retinal issues/PVD are meant to be painless?

Also, for the last few days I've noticed that if I close my eyes in a reasonably bright room, I get a pattern of lines in the affected eye. I can only really describe them as on the top and bottom of my eye, slightly curved, bending towards the centre/vanishing point. They disappear after around 2 seconds. I can't see them with the eye open; it's closed only, and only when in a light room, but not outside (so when going from light to dark by closing my eyes - I guess outside it's still bright enough even with the eye closed).

&amp;#x200B;

Since a year ago I've had trouble with my eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started at my work when I begun working as a software developer and I was sitting by my computer almost all day at work, and then I'd go home and continue programming/study at the computer. 

My eyes became red, and were littered with the red ""strains""( I don't know what it's called)  making my eyes even more red, become irritated and and my eyes felt tired. My days changed a lot, I felt uncomfortable when talking with other people, and it really lowered my productivity.

I believe the cause of my irritated and red eyes are because I'm spending a lot of my time infront of a screen.

And since I'm a programmer I begun my googling and found out it could be CVS(Computer-vision syndrome), and I haven't really found anything that helped me. Tried different kinds of eye drops and the 20-20-20-rule, and none have helped. 

I then went to my local health center and spoke with a nurse who told me to put a few plants by my monitor, which didn't help at all.

I'm about to book and appointment at the optician, but I want to ask here first since it's kinda costly and I don't have much money at the moment. 

I've looked into the Acuvue Oasys Hydraluxe contact lenses, do anyone have any experience with them? On their page they specifically state that they help eyes during heavy screen time.

I've been tested multiple times and I've got 20/20 vision, slight dry eyes for which I use lubricating eye drops, and a slight convergence insufficiency (4 exophoria in my left eye in whatever units that uses), none of which doctors say are enough to explain the pain.

I often get headaches that last for up to an hour and I have slight photophobia.

My 5 year old son presented yesterday with double vision and his left eye crossed. His eye was working this morning fine. Seems to be irritating him a little now. We took him to the ER yesterday. they did a quick MRI. They did not have any ideas as to what was going on. And they said the quick MRI looked normal. 

We saw an ophthalmologist at the Casey Eye Institute. She was very nice and very thorough. After many tests she can see that there are movement issues in both his eyes. Interestingly another child came in yesterday with the same symptoms. The doctor is currently working with a neuro ophthalmologist to come up with a plan but it looks like the following will most likely be done. 

I’m hoping someone can help explain what they are looking for with these tests. Or why they are the best options. 

1) Lumbar puncture to see if there is elevated pressure on his brain. She didn’t see symptoms of this in his exam but it seems like this is what she is leaning towards as the culprit. 


2) blood work to rule out Ocular Myasthenia. She didn’t see any signs of this during her tests and doesn’t think this is the cause, but it needs to be ruled out. 


3) COVID-19 test if they will let us. She kept coming back to this topic during our visit. I think the fact that another child came in with the same symptoms is making her curious about it. Another thing to rule out if it comes back negative. 


4) a sedated MRI so they can fully rule out any neurological issues in his brain.

Today after a long time i sat down on pc for the first time in weeks and spent 2-3 hours in!  
I can still sadly notice the floaters on brighter areas in the monitor, but what's been bothering me even more is something else , and i wanna ask some of you if you all had this problem when u got the Floaters!

So what my ""paranoid ass"" has had me acting up now is that, whenever i move my eyes fast or too fast across the monitor screen i see some sort of a small DOT like sort of a black hole in the white areas , like sort of a flash of light but middle is not as lightly

I dont know how else to explain it since english isnt my primary language. The flashes are not contionus, and i've noticed that i see that sort of in peripheral near or close the center? idk... but i do notice it now and i cannot unnotice it.... the other thing that bothers me is that i kinda do see it when i wake up and the eye floaters are more persistent when i wake up and then sort of go away and become less bothersome, but that ""flash of black hole"" sort of is active in dimly lit areas too for a split second and then goes away... is this normal and im just being paranoid?

She went back to specialists who said her retinas were fine, got prescribed a bunch of migraine medications, none of which worked, and finally got an mri to see if it might be a tumour or another neurological issue.

Anyways, the last doctor who interpreted her results basically told her, no tumour, her retinas are not detaching again, her vision is just like this now. She is understandably devastated but especially because she is an animator and artist.

I'm not posting on her behalf but more like,  I feel really helpless! and want to help! I've been reading things about retinas that I barely understand, but is this really the end?? Wouldn't a 2nd opinion be helpful? Could her vision just clear up naturally over time?",1,6,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/hlfnds/vision_problems_after_retinal_detachment_surgery/"")",2020-07-04 20:01:37,

hlj5si,Chronic eye redness on my child. (Long story!),"My daughter is currently 8 years old and has been having recurrent eye redness for years. It all started when she was around 4 years old and i noticed one eye would turn red while the other eye was completely normal.  Besides the redness, she is light sensitive and has pain that she describes as something is ""poking her eye""

I have been to multiple ophthalmologist and they always say it is just allergies. She had an allergy test and they told me she was allergic to mold, dust and tree pollen.

Because they believe its allergies, she is on multiple allergy medications. She has Cromolyn (4x day) olopatidine (2x day) and zaditor (2x day) eyedrops everyday plus takes 10ml of oral loratidine everyday.
NOTHING HELPS the eye redness go away. Steroid eyedrops are the only thing that will help but once we taper down and stop the steroid eyedrops the Eye redness flares up again! 

It is very frustrating going through this for years and i see how much discomfort my daughter goes through. Has anyone been through anything similar or any advice on what else i can do? I really dont think its allergies. The doctor says he doesnt not think its uveitis or JIA as she does not have any other symptoms besides the eye inflammation. Any info will be helpful!

hljjjj,Scleral Buckle vs. Vitrectomy,"I was diagnosed last week with a retinal detachment from 4-8 o'clock on my right eye. It doesn't effect my vision at all and was only found because I went to the optometrist for a few floaters I had been seeing in my eye for the last few months.
I was stationed in the military in Turkey when it was found and sent to a Turkish surgeon in the local city by the optometrist on base who originally found it. The Turkish surgeon examined me and said that the needed surgery is complex and required more follow-up than he could provide. He talked about there being a gas bubble involved and how gel would have to be removed.
After his recommendation I was flown as a wounded warrior, even though I'm nothing close to that, to a famous military hospital in the U.S. for surgery. The surgeon here was pissed that he had to see me on the holiday weekend and scoffed that the Turkish didn't operate. He said it's not that hard of a surgery and that the Scleral Buckle has been around for 100 years. He is now planning to operate this coming week because he wanted to get back to his weekend.
However, I realize now that he is doing a completely different and less complicated surgery than what the Turkish surgeon recommended for me. And that this is the reason that the Turkish couldn't provide follow-up for me. I'm wondering if before I have an irrevocable surgery done whether I should inquire about why he is not considering a vitrectomy? I feel like the Scleral Buckle is cheaper and easier, but I'm not sure if it is the best long-term solution for me especially since I have great vision and would prefer to avoid the change in eye shape that the Scleral Buckle will cause.

I've been to two ophthalmologists (the second one was at a well known eye institute for serious problem).

The second ophthalmologist prescribed steroid drops (Fluorometholon) for four weeks, which didn't seem to make much of a difference. This only made a slight improvement.

I always had dark brown eyes as a child and teenager and a few years ago (when I was about 25) I noticed they were suddenly green. I assumed it was maybe an age thing and I know people's eyes do sometimes like slightly different in different lights, so maybe it was a more extreme version of that. 

Feeling a bit bored, I've just done a bit of googling to see why it happens, expecting some interesting but routine answer. However, it looks like it's really uncommon and can be a sign of something more sinister.

hmp6ob,About 3 months ago I noticed my vision was slightly blurry from diplopia in both eyes.

It seems to flare up after any moderate physical exertion, but I've also noticed it without any exertion. The same eye has also been having periodic, mild throbbing/aching pain the past few days.

hn3qwl,Please give your opinion ! Kinda desperate with my eyes ! Possible allergies," Hello Guys and Gals , I would appreciate any opinion cuz I'm kind of fed up with how my allergies have been this year. So here it goes : I am allergic to quite a lot of stuff including the dog that I have so I'm gonna spare you all the stuff that I am allergic to. I'm quite used to sinus issues and stuffy nose pretty much all year round. That's not the problem this time. The issue is that 3 or 4 months ago I started having a lot of issues with my eyes . I've gone to 2 ophthalmologists both of which are quite good and I do indeed trust them because they have helped me before. The first one said it's due to my sinus being full and stuff gave me a lot of eye drops steroids etc. It did help a bit but not much also I took Xyzal (newer version of Zyrtec pretty much for those who haven't heard it). I have severe light sensitivity and my vision becomes blurry as the day goes on. That's my issue when I wake up in the mornings and early afternoon it's tolerable I can get some work done without much issues . However as the days go on things worsen when at night time most of the time it's really hard for me to work on the computer or watch tv etc. because of the light sensitivity (from which my I develop tension headaches because i squint my eyes ). I was kinda searching the internet because time went by but my condition didn't improve much. I am hypochondriac btw... So because of that I did some research and was beginning to think that I have chronic dry eye or something even more serious (blocked tear ducts ... etc)as I said I am hypochondriac so that's how it goes :D. My mother who works in a hospital said that she will take me to her friend who is the best ophthalmologist in the hospital for a second opinion just because things weren't working out much and I was getting more worried . However she pretty much said the same that it's due to allergies (plus I have just a tiny bit of a lazy eye which was adjusting due to the age that I'am in I'm 28) . So she did change my treatment a bit and I was kind of feeling better for a bit . However when I have to use the computer a lot or watch a lot of tv the next day my eyes become worse. I also have tiny bits of stringy mucus ( clear not yellow) but not much. My eyes do itch but not much , also they aren't really red . They have tiny bits of red but not much. So my issue is that I need to work ( as everyone I guess :D) which during the day is fine but if I have to work in the evenings or watch some TV it's bad because of the light sensitivity and my eyes become easily exhausted by that. By the way I do still work like that it's not to the point that it's impossible ( at least most of the time , cuz sometimes it's ). So my quetion to all of you is what's your opinion because I'm starting to question the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis again ? As I said I am hypochondriac , I do stress it a lot and stuff it's just what it is , so excuse me for asking for kind of reassurance :) . So to sum up my eyes are mostly clear , they don't itch much , they do have some mucus but only tiny bits and mostly when I overdo with computer and TV stuff, I have severe light sensitivity and my vision becomes worse as the day goes ? Also I do have other allergy symptoms at the moment with sinus, nasal stuff etc . My issue is that I do indeed tick some boxes for allergic conjunctivitis however some things don't quite make sense ( that my eyes are mostly clear and don't itch that much) . So I am not gonna waste more of your time , even if You have read all of my ""novel"" :D I really appreciate it because it's quite long ? What do you think , am I being stressed for nothing which will not be the first time and trust the 2 specialists that I've been to more ? Have you had similar issues ?

Doctor  was rushed, as there was a forest fire bearing down on my medium-sized  city  (I live in the intermountian western U.S. and this happened during  fire season---the fire burned many homes the following day.)   The  piece of rust stuck in the surface layer of my eye was giving me great  pain, so I went in anyway, even though I should have been packing to  evacuate.  Doctor and assistants were so rushed and scrambling to  accommodate me before they left the clinic.  I should have waited, I  know.  The fire didn't even reach the clinic office.

I  asked about the pain, and he said: ""Everyone has some pain.""  He gave me  medicine to take intraocularly, and I followed his directions to the  letter over the next few weeks.

It has become harder for me to look at light and to focus on objects. I often walk around without trying to focus on anything in particular because it hurts less. I use screens on minimum brightness with blue light filters set to maximum to make it a little more bearable. I often find myself switching eyes subconsciously while I type and using one at a time while the other one doesn't focus. I have found myself suffering from a weird issue with perspective, I don't know if it's related to this. Everything seems larger and closer to me than it actually is, even though I know the object is smaller. When I put on my partner's glasses, my image ""zooms out"" and it seems so much more natural to how I remember it. I used to test 20/10, in 2018, I tested 20/15 (and could still read some of the bottom letters), and now I test 20/20, 20/25. This is disturbing to me and I want my eyesight back. I remember how to focus on objects the way I used to but if I attempt it I have to look away almost immediately. The less effort I put into focusing, the less pain there is. I swear, I can still see, but something relating to this strain is making it impossible, eyesight doesn't deteriorate that fast, especially at my age, right? 

In bright light, particularly outside, I find it very difficult to look up. This has gotten progressively worse over the years. When I was at the eye doctor about  a week ago (I have covid  now, can't go again), when she shined the light on my pupils I jumped when it hit each pupils. I can't really look up at clouds anymore, and whether I'm indoors or outdoors, I find myself looking down and unfocusing my vision to relieve the strain a bit.

She gave me eye drops for dry eye, and I felt a little better for maybe 10 seconds. Then the pain came back, and it's normal. If anything, I can feel the pain in the center of my eye even more pronounced since the sides of my eyes feel fine.

I don't know that i would particularly want to see her again. Nor do I think asking people online will give me an answer. I am going to see a doctor, but this is just so frustrating, I'm at a loss.

Objects around me don’t change in size too much, just focus, and my body feels far too large for what is actually in reality (but not Alice in Wonderland, I can tell how big everything actually is but can’t accommodate my vision to change apparent size. Ihave always wondered why everything feels too big, and it’s because my freakin vision is not working properly. My field of view is restricted to the field of view you have when using your phone at waist level. I know for a fact my actual field of view is much wider than this.

I have noticed this problem since around age 11 or 12, but never bothered because I could still see 20/20 so I never realized there was an issue to begin with. However, I want my sight back. I have found myself confused, losing track of current tasks, and being easily distracted, when I know I’m not. It’s just that I can’t see and I get distracted whenever something pops up in that “perfect focus” area of my vision.

I don’t really want glasses. I don’t need them, I KNOW I don’t. Is there some kind of eye exercise or muscle relaxant for the eyes that will allow my eye to just chill out and not automatically focus at this focal length? If I do need glasses, it will CORRECT the muscle issue, not compensate for it and leave me inhibited, right?

I visited 3 eye specialists, 2 of them said my eyes are completely fine and do not have the need to wear glasses but prescribed eye drops + omega 3 tablets (which i didnt take). The 3rd eye doctor prescribed me glasses in February 2020 for my short sightedness which is:

-0.50 left eye, -0.75 right eye

What got me confused is the doctor said to keep the glasses on at all time, even when during near work which I find odd as won't that increase myopia? I also realized when i DON'T wear glasses when using phone (near work) I don't get eyestrain where as WHEN I DO wear glasses while using phone my eyes feel more strained. 

I also feel my eyes are more drier than usual and with chronic neckpain, I notice increased neckpain infront of screens.

This however means that I will be taking falls on climbs (hopefully not too many!). I am unsure how this will impact my eye - how much of a fall can I take?

hqhjo5,Headaches and tired eyes,"A month ago I was diagnosed with retinal dystrophy on my right eye and had photocoagulation done soon after. Since then I've had horrid headaches every day. I usually wake up with strong/moderate pain in my right temple and no painkillers can suppress it completely, it's always there. For a few times the pain began in my left temple, occasionally along with other unpleasant symptoms (stabbing pain when I lift eyebrows/radiating pain under and above my eye, as if under the bone/sometimes when I turn my head or look at the sun I feel stabbing pain in my eye all, as if someone poked it with a needle). 
The worst part is that it affects my vision too. My eyes get tired and blurry super quickly, 15 minutes on my phone feel like an all-nighter with Netflix, every time I have a ""tide"" of headache, it radiates in my eye and I feel some sort of pressure inside of it. Control tests at the ophtalmologist's have shown that the photocoagulation was successful, I went to two different specialists to confirm that and they both told me to visit a neurologist and stop worrying about my eyes (since retina has no nerve endings and if there are New dystrophies or tears it is painless). The neurologist prescribed me a course of piracetamum, but the pain hasn't gone or decreased at all. I have appointments to my neurologist and ophtalmologist next week, but I really need some reassurance because my last month has been an unending nigtmare of headache and fears for my vision, I can't concentrate on my daily routine and catch myself flinching every time I see floaters/something weird (no flashes/dark spots/rainbow auras so far thanks god). 
1) Could my neurologist misdiagnose me? Maybe I have migraines? I had a couple episodes of intracranial hypertension when I was a teenager (even spent a month in a hospital) but the last time I had headaches so severe was years ago and they never affected my eyes. 
2) I began using artificial years without preservatives to prevent dry eyes after working on the computer. Hasn't helped much with my problem, but they do make my eyes feel a little more comfortable
3) I've been wearing contact lenses for years and always with the same parameters (my eyes OS -9.75/OD-7.0, my lenses are OS - 7.5/OD -5,5). Maybe I need stronger lenses and my eyes get tired because of the imbalance? (weird, because I always felt comfortable with these parameters before the photocoagulation) 
4) Could it just be an anxiety that provokes my eyestrain? Last month has been an emotional mess for me because I'm terrified of losing my eyesight. Maybe the stress I had after the photocoagulation has caused the headaches and eye pains? 
Sorry for the long story, if someone has a piece of advice or a word of reassurance, I'd be very grateful to hear it. Much love from Russia &lt;3",1,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/hqhjo5/headaches_and_tired_eyes/"")",2020-07-13 08:42:32,

hqqs1y,"Grey bump on iris, recurrent, alternates between left and right eye","Hi,

I keep having this issue where I'll suddenly notice my eye feels irritated. Then it starts feeling like there is something sharp in my eye. If I look in the mirror, I can see a greyish-whitish speck that sort of looks like snot there. Sometimes it goes away on its own, but comes back. It alternates eyes, but never occurs in both eyes at the same time.

I went to Urgent care about a month ago for this problem (it was a Sunday and the pain/irritation was driving me crazy). They did a fluorescein stain and observed some uptake of the dye. They called it a corneal abrasion ""at roughly the 6'o clock position"", and also noted the greyish white speck of material, which they removed after a few tries with a moistened swab. They sent me home with Tobramycin.

Yesterday, I started noticing the familiar feeling and sure enough, there is a greyish whitish speck, but on my left eye instead, and also at \~6'o clock position. I have scheduled an appointment with my GP but I guess my question is:

Why does this keep happening, and why does it occur in nearly the same place on alternating eyes? Best guesses would be great, but I fully intend to follow up with medical care for the issue.

hqw5p8,"AZOOR, your symptoms and signs?","Sorry I’m advance, I’m formatting this on my phone. If you haven’t seen my posts before, I’m stuck in limbo with eye issues. I was born 3 months prematurely and spent a rather long time in the NICU. I have had very poor vision all my life with it getting worse over time, but typically correctable. The prominent eye issues have always been present but I thought they were normal. Otherwise, I’m a healthy, 19 year old female. I have a rather healthy eye, anatomically. Aside from ROP, and a large optic nerve pit(?) (I don’t know if that’s what they call it) that we didn’t find out about until a few months ago. My symptoms are: constantly adjusting vision (out of focus camera), black floaters and sparkle like floaters in the central and peripheral field of vision that I always see, grainy vision with loss of visual acuity, nightblindness, loss of depth perception, severe photophobia. I also have a small blind spot in my left eye, in my peripheral. I suffered two significant concussions (the second time really affected my vision but I thought it was normal, I don’t know why I did think that).

I tried visual therapy treatment for months with no sign of improvement at all. Treatment so far is dilating my eyes, which only clears up some of the visual acuity problem, I still don’t recover much of my vision. My prescription with contacts is +5.75 OS and +6.00 OD. I’ve been going to specialists around my state because the city I live in doesn’t have the resources to help me further. I thought this could be because of my anxiety and depression, and some is probably contributed from that. I religiously go to therapy and I meditate and do yoga a lot, I’m rather very calm most of my day. Stress does not make it worse, and meditation does not make it better. 

I know no one can give me a diagnosis without a thorough eye exam and probably some tests. Any idea what this could be? I’m seeing a specialist next week before I see the neuro-optho.

I searched around on google and found a solution that suggests to use eye patch to block the bigger eye, to force the body to use the smaller eye more often.

The problem is I have no idea if its actually caused by the stye or not, and if the muscle is just weakened or stretched, and I dont know if the solutions I found would work for stretched levator muscle.

hulgki,Weird blur/artifact in vision that started at focal point and grew wider until gone,"This is very difficult to describe, but I will do my best.

Yesterday I was on my phone, reading Reddit. I noticed what felt like a glare or reflection at the focal point of my vision that I was not able to refocus on. After a few minutes trying, i noticed at the focal point was a circular ""glitch"" of blur, partially translucent with many colors. Mildy kaleidoscope-like but only at the area where I focus.

At this point I went to the mirror to see if there was something in my eye or any discoloration. I tested pupil dilation by turning on the light and both eyes responded what appeared to be normally. If I covered up either eye, i could still see the weird spot, but not as easily.

After a few minutes the spot started to grow. The best shape I can describe it is a bold 'C'. I could now see focal point again due to the hole in the middle, but the peripherals had the glitchy blur.

At this point I was kind of freaking out, so I took my blood pressure and pulse. BP was elevated slightly at 120/89, unusual for normal but based on my anxiety at this point likely normal.

I switched back to Keto diet a few weeks ago, so I knew electrolytes could be out of balance, so I took a magnesium supplement and drank some sodium and potassium as well and laid down.

Within an hour, it was mostly gone. 18hrs later, my left vision still feels a little ""off"" when I think about it, but doesn't affect much. The eye feels a little bit strained but I also just woke up. Still appears normal in mirror and when I ask someone to look at it.",3,7,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/hulgki/weird_blurartifact_in_vision_that_started_at/"")",2020-07-20 06:42:54,

I've had a weird ""issue"" for maybe 4 years now. Maybe 1-2 times a year, I suddenly get double vision without any apparent cause. Closing one eye ""fixes"" the issue. And after a minute or two it sorts itself out and things go back to normal. It's a bit similar to being really drunk, only without the drinking.

I've been evaluated many times by ophthalmologists over the last couple of years because of a (tiny) persistent scotoma in one eye, and everything so far has checked out. But for some reason I usually forget to mention the double vision. The one time I did mention it, they ignored it. I suspect they already think I'm wasting their time with the scotoma.

hv100t,Possible Glaucoma? Smoking marijuana helps drastically.,"I’m going to keep this short and sweet.
30 year old male. Over the past year I have noticed my left lower eyelid has slowly, but progressively gotten “puffier”. I attributed this to aging. Over the past few weeks I have been experiencing pain in my left eye, an increase of puffiness or swelling of my lower eyelid, an increase of “floaters”, increased light sensitivity, and a feeling that my vision was “off” I figured some form of glaucoma could be a possibility so I smoked some weed and for the first time since my lower lid swelling started, it basically disappeared. The eye feels much more comfortable. I have booked an optometrist appointment but it is almost 2 weeks away. Should I treat this as a medical emergency? Aside from smoking weed all day until my appointment, is there anything else I can do? I’ve read that acetaminophen can reduce IOP by a clinically significant level. I might try this as well.

hvp4of,Central vision is blurry after cataract surgery and retinal detachment surgery,"Hello there. 

I had retinal detachment surgery November last year after getting the curtain symptom. My right eye went through PPV with silicone oil and scleral buckling, and my left went through lasers. Because of the pandemic, the oil removal was pushed to just recently, late June, and I got a cataract along with it. So after the oil removal and the cataract surgery, my eye has been healing but it's about 4 weeks in and I told my ophthalmologist that the central vision isn't clearing up but the peripherals are sharp. So he can't have my eyes refracted yet for a new  glasses prescription. 

The retina is completely flat he tells me. He asked if my right eye was a lazy eye before or if it had a tendency to be one, I said it didn't and that my right eye was the stronger one before the detachment. He told me to go through an OCT scan to check on my macula. And he also gave me lutein supplements. 

What could be the worst and best case scenarios that have happened to my right eye? What could be the most likely scenario? Should I be worried that my central vision won't be as crisp, I'm already very thankful that my vision was restored in my right eye.

Thank you so much for commenting or for any PMs regarding this. I really appreciate it.

hwcn3f,Seeing black outlines of blood vessels while waking up.,"Hello, this is my first post here.

I’m currently facing this weird issue the past few months ago (3 months ago I Guess) where by my eye’s been messing with me for quite some time.

Earlier 2020 before the lockdown begins I have no eye issues I’m doing fine and my lifestyle had sort of changed since the lockdown.

I’ve been using my laptop daily for 6 hours, studying courses and e-commerce as well as studying some optician stuffs (I graduated from opticianry last 3 years back before I did my national service for 2 years) and since then things starts to crumble down and hit me hard.

At first I thought I’m experiencing computer vision syndrome due to flashes and dark spots after Long usage of digital devices, I’m also using my phone often as I’m just started out my esport career which I end up have to retire early and quit till I fix The Eye issue.

I then realised something isn’t right I’m afraid it could be macular degeneration or retina tear so I went to have my eyes check at a GP and rest at home. The doctor shined some light into my eyes and she can’t see any abnormal issues with  both my eyes so she referred me to a eye hospital for further checkup which is on 2021 next year.

So far so good my eyes’s feeling better, flashes and spots has went down to almost none and I’m able to do my Everyday activities normally until another issue starts to hit both my eyes and worried me again.

Recently as my eyes are recovering, I use to see these weird blood vessels on my vision that will disappear immediately when I wake up and I thought it’s just temporary until today it happened again but this time it’s black coloured but it’ll disappear immediately after I opened my eyes.

The blood vessels will happen when I sleep on my side but when I keep my head’s straight and elevated for a few second then open my eyes again my eyes will open up like normal, nothing’s wrong.

But what’s causing these weird Purkinje tree thing on my eyes? It’s not just 1 eye but both eyes each time I wake up.

hwlytd,"24M. 7 appts, no solution for 6 months now. My ophthalmologist and optometrists don't know. Physical exertion moment caused constant eye irritation and major focusing problems. Pics included","Hey all,

24M, 5'7, 140lbs, have nearsightedness (-4) and astigmatism, from the US.

Saw my primary care twice (for bloodwork), ophthalmologist 3x, and two optometrists twice each. I'm not sure what to do anymore.

[Here's a link to the pics.](https://imgur.com/a/Fb32kD0) In the first pic, those tiny little inflamed hair-like lines is what went away only from the cycloplegic drops and felt normal/better. The larger red veins are when my eyes immediately strain from computer/driving.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR; physical exertion caused eye inflammation/irritation on out side white parts of eyes since the past 6 months, eye inflames a lot more with computer use and driving with an ache and is inflamed in general like when I wake up, cycloplegic refraction drops made eyes feel lot better temporarily, but doctors unsure what's going on, I am confused. Like my eyes lost focusing ability?**

**onset**:

Back in January 2020, in my last physical therapy appt for my knee, I barely ate the day before and day of, and my body was completely fatigued for this session. Was doing some intense exercise my PT gave me, and I could feel my eyes straining(?) intensely. The same night, my eyes felt like they got ""triggered"" and it's been a disaster since then.

**issue**:

Since then, the out sides of my eyes have been constantly inflamed and irritated. I'm a compsci guy, and I can no longer sit at my desk or at a chair and use my computer from a normal 2-3 ft apart distance. I can only use my computer if it's less than 2 ft away, otherwise my eyes become strained/inflamed within 5min if at normal distance at my chair/desk. Same with driving (eyes strain so quickly I barely drive now).

**What doctors said:**

\-Got my eyes checked, optometrists and ophthalmologist said dry eye syndrome/disease, but my eyes only get dry when using a computer or driving, or even randomly when they get inflamed. 

\- I am on a full dry eye regiment for 5 months now, all blood work came back normal (sjorden's, ANA, TSH, rheumatoid factor).  TSH tested twice this year and both times normal/healthy range. Ophthalmologist said unsure of what's going on since dry eyes doesn't look like it's the cause, says it could be vascular or something else systematic. 

\- ophthalmologist said I don't have uveitis. eye pressure was healthy every time checked. Little higher when eye inflamed (I think it was 17 and 18 at the worst), 16 otherwise. 

**medicines:**

\- been on an intense dry eye routine since february (eye mask and gel at night, daily PF single use drops, omega 3 daily, ample water, no air flowing at my face/head, eyelid scrub).

\- My ophthalmologist gave me Tobramycin-dexameth-opth back in June, and now he gave my doxycycline mono. Issue with the doxy is bc my extreme heat intolerance, he said the doxy causes sun sensitivity so I have been hesitant to start it. Not sure why I need an antibiotic if I don't have an eye infection either.

&amp;#x200B;

**other symptoms**:

Besides the eye irritation from the january onset, starting in april I started having other weird stuff going on.

\- sometimes I feel the eye pain going along the top sides of my head and down to the sides of the base of my neck as if it's a muscle strain feeling in my neck?

\- Developed sudden and extreme heat intolerance to the point where going outside for even 2min in the georgia summer sun makes my nerves (upper body mainly) feel like it's on fire.

\- fatigued. Sleeping a ton. Like 10-12hrs a day.

\- body overheats randomly for several minutes at a time multiple times a day. *I found out icing my body helps a lot. So I'd take an ice pack and put it over my eyes/temple region and my eyes would feel insanely relieved from this abrupt overheating and inflammation/irritation on my eyes.*

*- \*\*\** From back in January during the onset up to now, my carotid pulse randomly ""surges(?)"" where it is pounding, sometimes to the point where I feel nauseous. Yet if I go to the park to play some frisbee or a sport outdoors, my eyes are fine and even if my heart is pounding from running, no major issue, but the moment I sit in my car and get ready to drive, my eyes immediately start to dry up and inflame/irritate.

\- heat hives? Unless I run or if it's humid out (ie I sweat instantly), then my body overheats, get heat rashes on my body until I can sweat it out.

**weird part:**

\-Got a cycloplegic refraction done because my opthamologist suggested it, and my eyes never felt so normal before all this started (excluding the close up blurriness with glasses). The irritation and swelling was gone while the drops were still in effect, but as the drops went away, my eye inflammation returned.

\- from april onwards, whenever my body ""surges"" (over heat, pulse surge, etc) and my eyes get suddenly inflamed, my bottom lips immediately chap and peel within seconds. Then that feeling goes away once the ""surging"" goes away.

hwrlwc,How long do PVD symptoms last after vitreous detachment has occured?,"Asking on behalf of a relative who was diagnosed with PVD back in January.

He saw a number of different specialists, and was eventually told that the vitreous had detached and that his eyes were healthy/not to worry.

he's still having the usual symptoms, including what they describe as shimmery vision and seeing their pulse too. (These symptoms have been going on since 2017 at least, so I'm told)   


So I just wanted to ask a couple of questions hopefully to reassure him.

He had a few OCT scans that apparently showed the detachment had happened - is the OCT a reliable way of confirming that the vitreous has detached 100%?

If not is there any other test he could get to confirm it?

Also, is there's a time frame for how long the symptoms continue after the detachment has occurred?

We're both concerned it may not be normal for symptoms like this to be ongoing, but also I'm wondering if it might just be ""the new normal"" for them since the eye is more fluid than gel as with PVD and could perhaps be more susceptible to ""vibrations"" (he has a very strong pulse that can easily be felt)

Is there a chance the vitreous is still attached somewhere in the eye and that they could have complications going forward at some point?

At what point with PVD can you say you're ""safe"" if symptoms are still continuing but detachment as supposedly occured?

Is this something that requires further investigation, or is it something they just need to get used to?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'd usually take Lumify to get red of the redness and go back on Lotemax once a day when this happens.

My eye doctor said that sometimes people stay on Lotemax for years and said at worst case you would develop a cataracts or glaucoma, both of which can be dealt with.

Is there anything else I can do to try to control inflammation here or any tips? I'm getting a second opinion from a different eye doctor here to see what they have to say. It's frustrating that it's been two years and I'm still dealing with it. If I take Lotemax everyday for 5-10 years and my pressures do not increase, what are the chances something bad occurs from it?",1,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/hwu79l/ive_been_on_lotemax_everyday_for_2_years_due_to_a/"")",2020-07-23 20:16:30,

Now I am averaging 148 for the last month. I'm happy and proud of myself. Yesterday, on my drive home from work, I noticed that I had double vision. Instead of 1 stop sign, I see two.. etc, etc. Up close, I see perfectly fine. Even better than before. But things in the distance are doubled. I have an appointment with my new optometrist Wednesday but I was hoping I could get an idea of what it could be before then. I'm pretty frightened about this.

hxjfhi,Never ending asthenopia. Do I need an Orthoptics visit?,"Since March 2020, I've been having never ending eye strain and headaches, the symptoms of which have become increasingly unbearable (began with muscle tension around the face and temples, now develops into straight headache 30 minutes after any near work).

I've seen four different ophtalmologists by now, including a specialist who checked me for nearly everything possible, and nothing abnormal was found aside from slight dryness for which I was given preservative-free eye drops (that I use regularly).

The only important change that I was given is a 10° axis change on the right eye, which has made my vision clearer but hasn't resolved any of my symptoms. My only hope, reading online, seems to be an orthoptics test as I haven't been tested for convergence or accomodation problems in these past months. Would that be of any help? I have read online that diabetes could potentially cause similar problems but as of November my blood sugar levels were completely normal and have never been abnormal in the past. Also, I have noticed last night that I seem to have some double vision when looking at lights, but this doesn't seem to happen during the day.

Important info: I am astigmatic and have worn -0,50  180° (left eye); -1,00 180° (right eye) for around 7 years. Was given a new prescription -0,75 180° (left eye); -1,25 180° (right eye) in January and in May I was given -1,25 170° in my right eye (left eye remained the same). I have no prism in my glasses. Had amblyopia corrected when I was very young. I am not using any medication for other health problems so that can be excluded.

TL;DR: Have been suffering from eye strain and headaches for months and ophtalmologists have found nothing especially wrong with me.

hxkofa,How long after stye/chalazion heals can I wear contacts again?,"Hi, last thursday I (25F) believe I had a stye on my bottom right eyelid. I believe it went down quite a bit on friday, but on the inside of my eyelid, there was something that looked like a pimple with pus.
 I ended up getting antibiotic eyedrops (ofloxacin) just in case and continued it until monday where I saw my optometrist. 

She told me it wasn't a stye and was actually a cyst(?). She told me to stop the antibiotic eyedrops immediately and just use warm compresses and massages. She said if it doesn't drain, then an eye surgeon will have to remove it. I did exactly that but noticed whenever I did warm compresses and massages, it would get bigger again (after visibly getting smaller) so I just stopped doing that to see what would happen.

 Fortunately, it is now friday night and it flattened and there's none of the pus looking thing anymore.  It just looks like my inner eyelid with a sliiiiightly raised bump. Is it safe to wear contacts again? Or should I wait a couple more days?

hxu4y0,Eye infection vs bad reaction to OTC eye drops,"Hello. Just to start off with I have severe myopia (-13.00 in both eyes). I have worn glasses for 20 some years now and have worn contacts primarily for the past 14 years (daily disposables). I have not had any issues with my eyes until this past month.  I routinely get my eyes checked and do my best to take care of them, and have been told they are surprisingly very healthy considering my prescription. 

However last month at my routine appointment I found out that I “graduated” from my current contact lens brand that I was very happy with, and was forced to try a new brand (still one day disposables) as my prescription changed. Well this new brand of contact lenses has tore in my eyes twice now in the past 3 weeks. The first time this occurred was at the end of the day removing the lens from my right eye. I was subsequently diagnosed with a mild corneal abrasion which healed well. The second time this happened was this past Tuesday while I was putting the lens into my left eye during the morning. I had to go to my optometrist that same day so they could remove the broken piece for me. I was fortunate enough to not have a corneal abrasion this time around. And yes I have already filled out a complaint form to the company of this new brand but have not yet heard back from them. 

So I called my optometrist again on Friday (yesterday) as I developed pain and irritation in my left eye on Thursday afternoon, 2 days after he had to remove a broken piece of my contact from my left eye. I put some eye drops (Refresh tears) in Thursday night before I went to bed as I thought this could be due to dry eyes and woke up on Friday morning with some mild redness in the left eye and it was still quite irritated, to where it hurt to even blink. 

I was unfortunately not able to get in for an exam on Friday as I had to work all day. He prescribed me some antibiotic and steroid eye drops which I have been using as prescribed since last night and my left eye is now doing much better. However my right eye is now bothering me. I put in a eye drop (refresh tears) this morning in my right eye as again I thought the mild discomfort was again due to dryness, but it is now bothering me much more than the left eye. I have not used any of the refresh tear drops in my left eye since Thursday night. 
 
I am now starting to wonder if all of this discomfort is possibly related to these refresh tears eye drops which I started using on Tuesday after my visit to the optometrist, and I don’t plan to use these ever again.  Should I continue using the antibiotic/steroid drops in my left eye ? Should I start using them in my right eye as well? Are there any other eye drops for dry eyes I can try instead ? Of note my right eye is not red and I have not experienced any discharge from either of the eyes. 

I would love to explain all of this to my optometrist but unfortunately they are closed for the weekend.

I’ve seen 3 ophthalmologists, all within the same small-town hospital system.  Their only suggestions to deal with the severe evaporative dry eye are artificial tears and ointment at night.  The artificial tears (and I’ve tried many kinds) do nothing, they are gone in minutes.  

The ointment (Lacrilube seems the best), I’m applying 3-4 times a day, so of course I have extremely blurred vision in that eye.

i06g26,20% Success Rate for Retinal Detachment Surgery,"I've had an incredibly dense cataract since January of 2020 and due to a really bad optomertrist and another bad referral to a cataract surgeon, it delayed treating my cataract for months. Alongside this, COVID shut down happened which delayed it another 2-3 months. During this time, I believe my retina may have detached around April/May and I had worries about going blind in that eye. No one believed me and said I had nothing to worry about, even when I visited the ER with my concerns the doctors were like nah you're cool, just wait for cataract surgery.

I was extremely stressed at the time because my vision had gone from sight &gt; floaters &amp; blur &gt; light and shadow &gt; gray cast no light or shadow in a a matter of 3 months. Hospital said it was fine, just wait till July to receive surgery as this was back in April. 

I had cataract surgery on July 23 on my right eye and after I no vision as I thought to be honest. I had my retina specialist appointment today and he said I had a retina detachment on my right eye that has intense scarring. He stated that there is a 20-30% chance of fixing it with surgery and rushed me to book the appointment a month from now. I am lucky in a way to receive the surgery (covered by OHIP) and at a quick pace due to the fact it takes half a year to a year for surgery for some patients.

I'm pretty at peace right now because I've gone without my right eye for half a year and my left eye is perfect vision and has no damage after cataract surgery. My doctor said there is hope but it's a small chance and to be honest, I am remaining neutral. I guess it's because I know what it's like to go blind in both eyes for a period of time and really makes you humble about life and sight.

i0rajl,Looking for help. (Central Serous Retinopathy?)," 

# Looking for help. (Central Serous Retinopathy?)

Hello all,

I am looking for help on behalf of my wife (29/f) who was recently diagnosed with Central Serous Retinopathy, however, the diagnosis was not very clear. I apologize in advance for the long read and will provide cliff notes at the bottom. All help will be appreciated.

**Background:**

First week in July my wife experienced a loss of vision to what she describes as roughly 15%-20% of her left eye in a circular shape on the left hand side. She describes it as blurriness, to a darker gray early in the mornings. Essentially a blind spot.

She went to a walk in, who referred her to emergency to check for any detachment etc (typical I think?) We went to emergency, who essentially said they are not able to find anything too alarming and referred her to an Opthamologist.

The Opthamologist reviewed her eye and gave a 'rough diagnosis' of Macular Telangiectasia due to what appeared to be scar tissue, and then referred her to a Retina Specialist for further assessment.

The Retina Specialist looked at her eyes briefly, dismissed the Macular Telangiectasia diagnosis due to the scarring not being where you would usually see it if it was MacTel. The Doctor said he believes it more likely to be Central Serous Retinopathy.

This is where the main confusion began. In the same meeting, the Doctor said with CSR patients will usually see a full recovery in 4-6 months, however, said her vision loss would be permanent as there is no current CSR activity, which means the vision loss is likely due to scarring.

He then referred us to a follow up appointment to have an ink scan (Fluorescein Angiography I think.) We had this completed and returned for a follow up appointment today to discuss the results.

The Doctor entered, quickly scanned through the results on the computer, said again there seems to be no CSR activity, however, there is a very slight discoloration which is a sign of scarring and that her vision loss would be permanent. At this point I was confused, so I asked him if this was CSR and the average vision loss is 4-6 months and usually occurs while it is active, why did she not experience any symptoms until under a month ago. He said this is normal and while it is active it is common to not notice any symptoms, but once it concluded, the scarring is what caused the vision loss, and this may re-occur or may not ever (?) My wife then mentioned again it is nearly 20% of her vision. He said it is not 20% of her vision but also seemed taken aback at the same time and booked her in for another follow up Field of Vision test...

The Doctor, while I'm sure is very busy just seemed in a rush to get us out and conclude that the loss would be permanent, but we are both left very confused and unable to make sense of this. Especially considering it seems to contradict everything about CSR I am able to find. We feel more confused after seeing multiple specialists than we were when she woke up with the vision loss which is also likely disheartening for my wife. And at this point, taking days off work driving around from city to city for these 'tests' where nobody seems to be able to give a clear answer is sort of draining on us.

Thank you again for reading through, any clarity that can be provided would be extremely helpful.

\-Wife has vision loss 20% vision circular blur, left eye

\-Macular Telangiectasia misdiagnosis

\-Multiple specialist appointments

i0yudi,Too many chefs in the kitchen...how to decide between tattoo or pupilloplasty.,"In two weeks I have an appointment for a corneal tattoo to solve some glare I’ve experienced from an iridectomy, post-ICL. I chose this ophthalmologist off the recommendation of a friend who is a vitreoretinal surgeon and he seems very experienced (established the refractive surgery division of a publicly funded university). 

I had corneal tattooing done once but it faded quickly. The doc said it’s because of the type of ink that was used and also the ink was not dense enough and India ink will last longer. The problem is, not many people have experience with corneal tattooing and I have no data points to see if the tattoos last long enough to help solve this type of glare. 

Journals are conflicted - some say the tattoos fade. Some say that it is dependent on the technique and give advice on how to properly stain the tissue. 

Alternatively, I can have a phakic iridoplasty/pupilloplasty done. I have 1 iridectomy and it’s medium sized. It isn’t “huge” but sure isn’t small either as it was made using a surgical vacuum not a laser. It’s at 11 o clock so probably why it’s so bothersome. 

This time, I wanted to do everything in my power to make sure this goes right, so if it fails, I can say at least I tried my best.

I consulted with multiple, highly skilled ophthalmologists including some of the big names. 1 offered to stitch it and said it can be done. 1 of them seemed like I had two heads when I was asking him to stitch it, as if I didn’t understand the risk it entailed. My friend and his friend that he referred me to (the guy doing the tattoo) seemed negative when I mentioned stitching it too because they said tattooing is easier and less risky, but that was before these journals came out saying the ink fades. 

One other factor to this story is that this is my good eye. My UCVA in this eye is 20/25, BCVA is 20/15. For my other eye, it’s highly distorted due to keratoconus so I only get like a blurry ~20/50 at best. 

Just wondering how I should decide. Right now I was thinking, maybe the new corneal tattoo will last me 10 years. By then, I’ll probably need my ICL exchanged or I’ll have a cataract by then and we can do a combined lensectomy and iris repair. Or I can chance it now and just do a phakic pupilloplasty (as it’s easier to do now since a majority of the ink has depigmented) but some doctors say it’s high-risk while some say it’s been done and isn’t something to be concerned about. 

If anyone has any tips or guidance I’d appreciate it. I’m going to bring this up during my consult as well but figured it doesn’t hurt to post here.",1,13,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/i0yudi/too_many_chefs_in_the_kitchenhow_to_decide/"")",2020-07-30 18:46:27,
i13qrj,Visual disturbances in peripheral vision (left eye only),"Hi!

For the last two months I've been experiencing this constant phenomena in my left eye. It takes the form of a glittering/shimmering patch during the day and graduates into a pin wheel effect when the sun goes down. It likes to hide in the extreme peripheral of my vision, however sometimes the pin wheel effect travels about halfway between my center and peripheral. Brightness of the environment seems to affect the intensity of the sensation, as well as physical exertion. I can witness it fizzle out when I close my eyes in a dark room. Also, sometimes with the flickering, a black dot about the size of my pinky nail if I were to hold my arm out, appears in the top left of my vision and it flickers rapidly. It looks the exact same as when you press on your eye ball from the outside. I work in finance so I'm on the computer around 12 hrs a day for work, and another 4 hours for play. I use lubricating eye drops and use Gunnar glasses @ work.

Other related conditions relating to the affect eye ball:

\- I have astigmatism (left only)

\- A cataract, however my focal point is not affected by it, still 20/20

\- The whites of my eyes are crusty-brownish in both eyes, despite drowning them with eye drops.

\- The last time I went to the gym I exerted myself pretty heavily, giving myself double vision. When I tested my eyes out one by one, my right eye was fine but it was my left eye that was experiencing double vision. It felt as if it was unaligned with its normal gaze. Ie, if I were to look at a item, it would move a couple inches away from where my right eye saw it. Hard to explain I know. This happened previously before I started to experience the flickering. 

\- Sometimes I have double vision when looking straight down at something at a distance, ie when I stand on my balcony and look at something on the street. Happens on occasion.

I have experienced this flickering/shimmer before, the last time was back in 2018 when I had a massive onset of floaters. I got thoroughly checked out and all was fine.

i1ih13,Doctors are stumped; not sure where else to turn,"TL; DR: (1) What causes chronic unilateral (OD) redness, inflammation, and a ""sandpaper cornea"" appearance (leading to decreased visual acuity) for over a year in the absence of an autoimmune disease, diabetes, an STD, an infection (whether viral or bacterial), or trauma to the eye? and (2) what are treatment options other than artificial tears, steroid drops (FML and Lotemax), Retaine, punctal plugs, oral doxycycline, topical antibiotics, taping my eye shut at night, Prokera, and a humidifier (already tried them all)?

INTRODUCTION: Over the past year I have seen several ophthalmologists and am currently under the care of a cornea specialist, but every doctor I have seen is stumped as to the cause of the symptoms I am experiencing (described below), so as a last ditch effort I am reaching out to the Reddit community to see if there is something that may have been overlooked. Thank you in advance for reading through this lengthy post and for any insight you can provide.

RELEVANT PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

\--36-year-old female with no diabetes, no autoimmune conditions (based on blood tests), no ocular trauma, and no history of herpes or syphilis or any other STDs

\--Nearsighted with astigmatism (both eyes)

\--long-time contact lens wearer (over 20 years)

\--no eye trauma

\--only eye surgical history is chalazion removal from my right upper eyelid

\--dry eye (OD), blepharitis (OD), and possible MGD (OD)

\--In 2017 I had a bought of severe SPK, which was successfully treated after several months by discontinuing contact lens use, low-dose oral doxycycline, aggressive use of preservative-free artificial tears, and use of Retaine.

COURSE OF CURRENT PROBLEM: In late August 2019 I awoke one morning with acute redness in my right eye, but no photophobia, no floaters, no tearing, no pain, no discharge, and no loss of visual acuity. I discontinued contact lens wear, went to Urgent Care, and was diagnosed with **conjunctivitis** and put on topical antibiotics. Fast forward a couple of weeks and when the redness did not abate I went to see an ophthalmologist and was prescribed FML steroid drops and diagnosed with **episcleritis**. The doctor hypothesized I might have an autoimmune disease but subsequent blood tests have ruled out that possibility. 

I have since seen two other ophthalmologists and I am currently under the care of a cornea specialist. At one point I was switched from FML drops to Lotemax drops, and I have been taking oral doxcycline for approximately two months. The doxycycline has done a decent job of getting rid of most of the redness, but, unfortunately, my visual acuity has nosedived in my right eye. Fluorescein staining reveals a ""sandpaper-like"" quality to my cornea, especially the lower half. I've tried everything from preservative-free eye drops to steroid drops to doxycycline to taping my eye shut at night to getting a humidifier, but nothing seems to help and the doctors have not yet figured out what is causing the irregularities in my cornea.

Recently, when I wake up in the morning I have about 5 minutes of nearly perfect vision in my right eye, but it quickly deteriorates. My vision also improves for about 30 seconds after I put in lubricating drops, but then goes blurry again. My vision also improves when I use ""pinhole glasses.""

LATEST HYPOTHESIS: At my most recent appointment, my doctor mentioned that I may have ""neurotrophic cornea,"" but this will have to be confirmed next week. I am currently using a Prokera lens and hope that it helps.

QUESTIONS:

1. Other than SPK and/or episcleritis and/or neurotrophic cornea, are there any differential diagnoses to consider? I asked about RCE, but my doctor said the damage to my cornea doesn't fit the pattern of RCE.
2. Assuming I have neurotrophic keratitis, is there any medication other than Oxervate? I have insurance but my understanding is that I will not get coverage unless I have Stage 2 or 3 NK (which I doubt, but will be confirmed by the doctor next week). Without insurance, my understanding is my out-of-pocket costs will be over $20,000.
3. Any other treatments I should talk to my doctor about? Any surgical interventions to ask my doctor about?",1,19,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/i1ih13/doctors_are_stumped_not_sure_where_else_to_turn/"")",2020-07-31 16:59:51,
i1jbi5,Scotomas,"Hey everyone- I know that I probably won’t get an answer or anything on here, as no where I have looked have I found one. I’ll start my story with where it all began. 3 years ago (when I was 17) I had bad health anxiety related to my eyes. I started hyper focusing on my visual snow (which I believe I have always had), and not long after that, my mother, grandmother and grandfather all got diagnosed with MD within the same week. That freaked me out, and for over 7/8 months I was constantly in some sort of anxiety focusing on my eyes and such. After a while it subsided, and I carried on. Well one day, while I’m class, I saw a tiny “comet” in my left eye, and it then “exploded”. After that, a small colour spot, almost looking like an avocado with a hollow inside appeared. I freaked, went to my optometrist a few days later, and was told nothing is wrong. After a few weeks the spot subsided, but I continued to get “temporary” spots, all of which are monocular (I should add that these spots either look like A dark purple coloured patch, or an after image). The initial one always comes back every few weeks-month or so, and stays for a while, but fluctuates in its prevalence. Because these spots never were permanent, and albeit annoying and I suppose a bit worrying, I got on with my life and overall did not think about them much. Fast forward to early March of this year, I had a bad flu or something. One day, I woke up and in my right eye, were 4 decently large scintilizing scotomas. They were in a “diamond” shape, one at each corner, directly around my central vision. I flipped again, saw my optometrist and was told nothing is wrong. These spots went away within a week. I knew, and still know that something is wrong. I ended up finding a group of people with something similar, or hell, even the exact same. Many people in the group mentioned how they have permanent spots, which I had not noticed up until that point. I then proceeded to search both eyes for blind spots, and found 2- one in each eye- at the paracentral mark- not in my central vision, but not as far as my natural blind spots. Again, flipped out, saw my optometrist and then saw an ophthalmologist. No one found anything with any scans, or dilated exams or anything. Despite these being here, with both big enough to block out my thumb nail at arms length away, nothing even came up on the visual field. Nothing was found, and nothing still is. I got desperate enough to pay for an MRI without contrast (being in Canada, it’s not cheap- maybe even a bit more than in the States). Again, nothing. These 2 true blind spots in my vision have remained, and overall, aren’t noticeable nor are they bothersome in day to day life. It’s more the knowledge they are there that bothers me. I don’t know if I will get any more permanent ones, or if this is it. Will I go blind, will I be mostly fine? Who knows. What I do know is I am dreadfully scared, no answers and none of the doctors are taking me seriously (nobody believes me, nor will they send me to a retinal specialist or a neuro-ophthalmologist). I am at wits end, and have trouble going on some days... I just am so scared of what may be wrong.

Further symptoms I have that may or may not be relevant:

-Pulsatile Tinnitus (left ear only)
-Regular Tinnitus (left ear only)
-Tachycardia (docs think it’s because I’m a bit overweight and severely out of shape)
-ridiculous amount of floaters for my age
-migraines (a handful of times a year)
-Geographic tongue (rarely)- essentially I lose patches of taste buds in my tongue for a week or 2 at a time, and then I go months and months without it happening again.

I’m just so scared. 


TLDR; weird unexplained monocular scotomas in each eye, and temporary “bright spots” as well. My visual acuity is great. Just these spots. Any thoughts on what this could be?

i1podr,[Advice Wanted] Darkness in Peripheral,"Hi Everyone,

I have had an issue in my vision which I first noticed about 4 years ago. In my top right peripheral there is a dark spot or shadow if you will. It's only noticeable when blinking or low light situations. Usually I can ignore it but it can cause a bit of stress/anxiety. Imagine a circular section that is your outer right quadrant of vision that is slower to adjust from dark to light causing an after image effect. This effect is much worse if I've been in a dark room and walk into a light one and blink but returns to normal after 30 seconds or so. 

When I was born both of my eyes were turned, my right eye was corrected via surgery as a baby but the left surgery failed and the eye return to turning outwards. My left eye has a shadow in the upper right quadrant as well and my local ophthalmologist ordered an MRI which came back clear. I've had several slit exams which came back with a lattice degeneration (unrelated I'm told) and all else is clear. I've also had a standard visual field test and a neurological visual field all of which have come back normal.

My last visit to my ophthalmologist (24 months ago) advised it could be a compansation scotoma cause by growing up with a turned eye. All in all I've seen 3 optometrists and 2 opthamologists in a 5 year period with no concrete answer as to whats going on. 

Have any of you fine people heard about this type of thing before and what recommendations would you have moving forward.

# Worried about having ocular melanoma!

📷

Hi! I hope I am posting this in the right place. I am very concerned about having ocular melanoma. About 5 to 6 months ago I saw a tiny gray speck in the white part of my right eye. At first I didn't really think that much of it. Around that same time, my right eye felt slightly bigger and heavier than my left eye. I tried to find anything similar to the speck on my left eye, but I didn't see anything on it at the time. I was trying to make an appointment to see an ophthalmologist soon. However, my grandmother died and then COVID-19 hit right after that, and doctors offices were closed for 6 to 8 weeks. I have not been checked by an ophthalmologist in almost 3 years now, unfortunately. Anyway, in June I made an appointment for this coming Monday, August 3.

Since I have first noticed the speck on my right eye, I have also noticed that sometimes my eye stings some. It comes and goes. I have also noticed that I see very small, brief flashes of light in my right eye. I usually see them while I am staring at a computer screen. My eyes often feel strained and tired because I look at a computer screen most of the day. I have also seen a few in my left eye, but they are not as frequent as in my right eye. I have read that seeing flashes of light can be a sign of a tumor pushing on the retina, or can even be a sign that the retina is detached. I guess the flashes are my biggest concern. Also, I have since noticed a small gray speck on my left eye. It is not as prominent as the one on my right eye, and it is in a slightly different location. However, it's still on the white part of the eye, and it looks similar to the one on the right.

Now I am constantly trying to notice my vision and how everything looks, particularly in my right eye. I am driving myself crazy doing this! I am near sighted and need glasses to see far off, such as when driving or watching TV. However, I can still see well out of both eyes, especially with my glasses on. I have not noticed a change in my ability to see out of my right eye. I can close my left eye and still see and read well out of my right, even things that are far off with my glasses on. I also have floaters in both eyes. In does seem like I have more in my right eye, though. But I am worried sick that this could be ocular melanoma. Has anyone experienced seeing tiny, brief, occasional flashes of light that turned out not to be a tumor or just a retinal detachment not caused by a tumor? I know that cancer is my greatest concern. My ophthalmology appointment is in two days. I am very nervous and scared of what they will find.

# Worried about Ocular Melanoma

📷Worried about having ocular melanoma!

📷

Hi! I hope I am posting this in the right place. I am very concerned about having ocular melanoma. About 5 to 6 months ago I saw a tiny gray speck in the white part of my right eye. At first I didn't really think that much of it. Around that same time, my right eye felt slightly bigger and heavier than my left eye. I tried to find anything similar to the speck on my left eye, but I didn't see anything on it at the time. I was trying to make an appointment to see an ophthalmologist soon. However, my grandmother died and then COVID-19 hit right after that, and doctors offices were closed for 6 to 8 weeks. I have not been checked by an ophthalmologist in almost 3 years now, unfortunately. Anyway, in June I made an appointment for this coming Monday, August 3.

Since I have first noticed the speck on my right eye, I have also noticed that sometimes my eye stings some. It comes and goes.

i2kgvh,Do I really need prism glasses and also concerned about getting them,"I currently wear glasses and suffer from astigmatism, however recently I have  been getting dizziness, feel like if my eye is pulsating, and notice when I go on my computer or mobile phones I see the screen and text slanted and also I do not suffer from double vision. My optometrist had told my that one of my eyes tends to shift away and recommended me to an ophthalmologist and to another specialist who did other measurements and said I did not require prisms or anything of that sort, this was about two years. I recently went back to my optometrist and she recommended a new prescription with no prisms in it. However I am still experiencing these issues. I took a second opinion and this optometrist said she noticed my eyes move a bit to the sides and she recommended prisms with anti fatigue lenses to reduce eye fatigue, and suggested vision therapy however that is out of my budget, she suggested to get the prism glasses.  I have visited my family doctor, had an MRI, which is normal.

I am concerned if the prism glasses can damage my eyes or affect my eye muscles and force me to take vision therapy or some sort. These are my prescriptions below.

i349u0,Does Recurrent Corneal Erosion get worse with time?,"My doctor didn't tell me that I have it \*yet\* but I'm mooore than sure that I do because of the symptoms I had. One year ago I poked my right eye with my finger, it healed pretty quickly the next day. Everything was perfect until after 5 months I switched from glasses to contact lenses, I was not careful with them, I slept multiple times with them and one night I slept with them and woke up the next day with pain in my right eye, I went to the doctor and he said it's because the lens dried on the scratch and it was still healing, so he cleaned it and put a cream on my eye and covered it and it healed the next day. Now after that, there were a few days where I would wakeup and feel like my right eye kind of bothers me, this usually goes away after a few minutes and it happens mostly when I forget to turn off the lights before I sleep, but there were are also days when I wake up just normally and wouldn't feel anything. I kept ignoring the issue because I was very busy with college, and I never had an episode during the day. Now today, I woke up and had all the symptoms I had again with my past two experiences all of a sudden, I went to the doctor and they did the usual thing but this time she wanted me to use the night cream for a month, she still didn't talk to me about it (I have an appointment tomorrow) but I'm 100% it's RCE. 

Will the symptoms get worse with time? I read experiences of other people and my case seems better than many people but I wonder if it's because it has just started? will it bother me during the day and basically change my life? also, is it safe to keep wearing contact lenses instead of glasses while practising good contact lens hygiene? also, from what I read it seems like I will have to deal with it for life but is there anyone who got rid of it completely?",1,8,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/i349u0/does_recurrent_corneal_erosion_get_worse_with_time/"")",2020-08-03 12:57:56,
i389ha,Dry eyes have killed my quality of life. Please help,"I don't know what to do. I am miserable. I wore contacts for about 6 or 7 years. I often slept in the contacts because I stayed at freinds houses and didn't take my contacts storage with me. Very naive i know. I eventually gor very irritated eyes when wearing contacts so stupid me decided lasik sounded like a good idea, i would be free of the burden of wearing glasses and having uncomfortableness from contacts. I ended up getting lasik in December of 2015. I now realise i probably had dry eye before getting lasik, and the lasik might've made it even worse. I didn't start experiencing dry eye until 10 months after the procedure. The eye doc I originally went to for lasik gave me prednisolone, it seemed to work and my dryness lasted only a month. I also took restasis but only for a few weeks. Three years went by with no issues. Unfortunately in November of 2019 about 4 years after the surgery, my dry eye returned worse than the first time. It started when I was sitting at a movie theater watching a movie, I'm guessing the dark room and huge screen had an effect on my eyes. I was also about a week into a quarter life crisis, and stopped smoking marijuana and drinking about a week before that, all of which had me extremely stressed. I sometimes wonder if stress brought this on, but I also am quick to blame it on the lasik. Since then I have been to two eye docs with not much relief or positive results. I have taken lotemax sm, alrex, systane nighttime ointment, lotemax ointment, xiidra, avenova lid wipes, tea tree lid wipes, bacitracin on my eye lids at night, preservative free prednisolone, have been doing warm compresses, all of which have not helped. I am currently weening off of the prednisone and praying it helps even in the weening off process. The next thing the eye doc has me doing currently is taking restasis which i got 6 months worth of for free from a patient assistant program but honestly i cannot afford it after that as it is ridiculously expensive. I also am not convinced it will work because xiidra did not work. She also has me doing warm compresses, avenova, bacitracin, and otc celluvisc 4 times a day still. All of this has already cost me more than the lasik did and then some. Honestly at this point i am extremely stressed from this and am suicidal. I dont want to live like this anymore. I have been trying to keep hope that it will get better but it has been 6 months and I have lost hope. Is it possible that if i somehow remove this emotional baggage and stress it will get better? Is there any way that it can get better without having to take an eye drop everyday or am i going to have to live the rest of my life like this? I am only 26 years old. I really want a life where im not thinking about my eyes all day. I have been considering joining the military but want my eyes fixed first, plus i don't even know if they would take me with dry eye. I want a time machine right about now. Does anyone have any clue what I can do to get out of this mess or have any input as of what couldve caused this? It seems weird to me that it happened 4 years after the surgery at a time where i was in a low point mentally.

Edit: i forgot to mention i also have punctal plugs in, have used humidifiers at night, and have taken Nordic natural fish oil, and also eat salmon at least twice a week all with no results. Also the symptoms seem to be worse in the morning before i even open my eyes and at night. They are also extremely dry when my eyes are closed wheni sleep or even just ""rest"" them during the day. The eye doc doesn't think that it is MGD but thinks it's my eyes just not being able to produce enough tears. She also said that my eyes dont look inflamed. Also, sometimes when I blink I can literally hear my eye lids opening up like a clicking sound. When I close my eyes I and move them left and right each one eye also makes a clicking sound when looking inward towards my nose. I also got tested for sjogrens and got my thyroid checked both through blood tests and they both came back negative. I have considered getting scleral but they are incredibly expensive from whay I've heard and apparently only last 1-3 years.",1,7,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/i389ha/dry_eyes_have_killed_my_quality_of_life_please/"")",2020-08-03 16:34:19,

i3d6he,Hello everyone I need some advice regarding glasses.,"Hi everyone I’m a 26 year old guy with a mild to little severe eye twitch. Sometimes my eyes feel very dry, strained and irritated that triggers the twitch. I’ve recently learned how to switch the blinking back to unconscious when people at work start being very mean about it and also people in everyday life. But doing this can be quite exhausting. What I’m trying to get help with is knowing what kind of glasses I can get to HIDE my twitching best. I’d like to get something like the glasses that turn dark when you’re outside in the sunlight, but I’d like them to stay like that all the time and that will look good indoors. I recently saw a guy at work wearing that kind of glasses but they had a purple tint. Also I’d like them to have side shields so that no one can see my eyes blinking from the sides. You see over here in the city where I live it seems like people in general but women especially have this agenda against blinking more so men blinking and they use this as an excuse to give you all these sneers even if you aren’t twitching maybe to validate themselves I’m not sure why . Like I really do have the twitch but I’ve seen how they judge guys who don’t even have it and make them super self conscious about blinking. Like you can’t even blink when your eyes water right after yawning without having them give you a sneer, make fun of you of plain and simple give you the resting bitch face. Anyway since I look at my phone screen for long periods of time I think they should probably have an anti glare coating as well.

i3hr9t,Focal Macular Thinning,"I'm getting desperate, so I thought I'd turn to reddit. Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post in. The original one got removed from r/ophthalmology however I did get one response which I'm grateful for.

I'm not seeking medical advice in response to this post, I'm seeking where to go in search for it.

I've seen a couple of Ophthalmologists (one in a public hospital and another one private) but am told there's nothing to that can be done to treat my condition, but my question is where to from here? Who can I speak to with regards to making living with it easier.

Bit of background, I'm from Melbourne, Australia. I was involved in a motorcycle accident, broke my femur. This led to fat emboli syndrome, and amongst other things, 4-5 'cottonwool spots' in each eye, and although these have resolved, I now have 'focal macular thinning' (as shown on an OCT scan). Also, it is about 5months post accident.

It is difficult to explain to people who don't understand the injury the impact this is having on my vision and as it seems to not be common, there's no examples online.

The closest thing I've found is those 'spot the difference' images and when viewing them using a 'crossview' technique. Basically images are 'wavy/shimmer' where each eye is seeing something different.

i3x4mr,Cluster of transparent circles in central vision of non-dominant eye,"Female. 56 years old. Healthy. For the past year or so, I've very occasionally noticed something like tiny static clear circles when l look at white areas. It's like visual snow that does not move and can only be seen on light surfaces. If I look at white text on a black background, the black is normal, but the white is filled with tiny circles of white with black edges. Normally, it would last 5-10 minutes and then go away. Then I noticed I could trigger it by looking down at a sharp angle, like if I was trying to see something on my upper chest.   


I've had scintillating scotomas for a decade, so I had originally assumed it was neurological. Today, however, I had one of the static-y episodes, and it lasted about 30 minutes so I had time to study it and it's only on the right side. Between that and being able to trigger it, seems more like an actual ocular issue.  I also noticed that it's actually a small circle in my central vision made up of small circles. (I can see this by looking at a larger white area like a wall). It's a circle that's about 5% of my vision, exactly in the center, and that circle has about a hundred transparent circles in it. When I look at the Amsler grid, no lines look wavy but wherever black touches white in the grid, I have a small checkerboard outline. This goes away if I close the right eye and only look with left. The overall effect is that my reading is blurrier when I have it, but if I'm looking around at nature or dark objects, I wouldn't know anything was wrong.   


I can't go to the doc unless it's very serious because my husband is high covid risk and we're stayed pretty well quarantined - grocery pick-up outdoors is the most we do. I just can't find anything about anything like this online. Sounds likely retinal since I've had shadowy floaters for years but it's weird that it can be triggered by looking down.

I was diagnosed with the above last year, and have been under the hospital to look into it. It was decided that they would give me a YAG laser iridotomy. This happened and everything went smoothly.

Just had my 2 week review, and explained since I found out about this, I stopped running and doing high impactive exercise. The consultant said to me that a healthy lifestyle was far more important, and that I shouldn't put my life on hold due to something that might cause glaucoma. He explained that many people with the condition actually sometimes do not develop glaucoma in their life time. He said I would be fine to start running again, and keep up with my yearly eye exams to keep things in check. He also said the laser treatment should help with the issue as well.

So just wondered what the general consensus was on here? I am not a hard core runner, just a few 5ks a week in the woods. I have desperately missed it, and it has affected my mental health stopping it. Nothing better than running and feeling free! Well for me anyway!

i4gbt2,Mystery Eye Problems,"Hello. I've been having some bad eye pressure for the past few months along with some pain. It's 99% of the time in my left eye. I've been to three Ophthalmologists and have even had a CAT scan done but nothing has been resolved. It comes and goes randomly, as does how bad it gets. The pressure sometimes is felt along my nose, other times behind my eye, other times around it, and other times along my eyebrow. It kinda feels like there's not enough room for my eye in my eye socket. Also, I can leave me left eye open for minutes at a time without having to blink (I haven't tested how long I can have it open) or getting that stinging feeling, whereas my right eye has to blink unusually much more than my left eye. When faced with wind, my left eye can look into it for minutes upon end without having to blink and can't even feel the wind hitting the eye itself or the eyelid, and my right eye being way more sensitive than it should be and having to blink every second or more to look into it, and my eyelid almost feeling like it's not blocking any wind from hitting my eye when it's closed. Can anyone here please help me on what is going on with my eyes, both pressure and sensitivity to being open and wind?

i4jhma,Difficulty focusing,"I am a thirty five year old male who wears glasses for nearsightedness. 

I have a great deal of difficulty focusing, both far and near, and regularly have red eyelids and darkness around my eyes. 


I work retail and the time I use computers at home I try to follow the 20 20 20 rule. 


I used to read a lot of books, but due to the strain, I haven't finished a book in years (I still listen to audio books though).


One unusual thing I'd like to mention is that when I go for my yearly optomotrist appointment, the chemical that dilates my puples stings like hell, but I can focus perfectly fine for several days after.  I mention this stuff every year to the optomotrist, but have never been given much advice.

i4pozf,Color saturation in both eyes,"Since 2018 I noticed both eyes perceive colors slightly different, my left while my right is closed sees colder colors, and my right warmer brighter colors. This doesn’t appear consistent to optic neuritis.
I’ve had TONS of tests done bu multiple ophtalmologist, retina specialist and neurologist no one could find anything wrong with my eyeS or brain

I had :
2 MRIs all clean no lesions or anything , VEP test, checks on my visiul field, no issues in my macula and in both eyes I have a bit of pigment clump since I was a kid I am 30 now. I don’t have retinitis pigmentosa, but I am a carrier of choroideremia. Still all doctors tell me this has nothign to do with this visual effect. I have been checked multiple times for cataracts, and macula issues and so far my eyes are healthy despite of me being a carrier of choroideremia. 

In 2018 I had a vaccine I was allergic to, and is when my vision issues started as well as stress. They never proved it but believed there was swelling of the optic nerve as a reaction to the vaccine. My vision eventually got better, and since doing vision therapy I sometimes notice my left eye color difference is gone, sometimes back.
I do have binocular issues problems slight misalingment being corrected in vision therapy, I have no idea when this started

My neuro opticien ran several tests including one where he looked at the surface of the back of my eyes like this 3D model  and saw that the back of my left eye is not that perfect as my right, not that its a problem just he said this might be why the image quality is not as nice than in my right. Keep in mind even with binocular misalignment I still have 20/20 vision. The neuro opticien mentioned maybe is because when I see through my left and close my right eye and my right is my dominant eye maybe that’s why the darker vision of the cover eye overalps and causes the color difference. True vision therapy i found out indeed my brain sometimes takes over the image of my right eye and suppressed input from the left a little bit 

What do you think? I’ve seen really multiple specialists and no one can give me an answer, they ruled out all possible sinester things to my eye and brain. 
Overall my vision is okay, I just always get so much anxiety by this color difference I seem to perceive on and off, don’t know if it was always like this and I just never noticed until in 2018 I became obsessed wi the my eyes",1,1,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/i4pozf/color_saturation_in_both_eyes/"")",2020-08-06 03:59:16,

i515xb,Second times the charm - silver lines and zig zaggers and spots that move really fast - definitively not floaters!," 

No, they are not floaters. They form, and like a train, they pass through my vision at some point, and then vanish, poof.

I have issues with Hypertensive Retinopathy and CWS and BP, so I am more aware about things happening as of late.

The floaters I have, I can see, and they are large, worm like, wriggly and when I look straight forward, they don't move.

These   specks of bright silver, almost magical looking, some interesting   colour and intense brightness they carry, these tiny specks are about a   milimeter in thickness, and vary from lengths of a ""pin needle tip"" to a   length of an actual train, 2-3 millimeters.

That   they also move irregularly, but on a path, makes me think these are   actually blood vessels, and I am intense distress and fear that what I   see is the same you see when you see ""stars in your eyes"", blood cells   and stuff moving through your retinal blood vessels... and because they   sometimes seem to ""struggle through, to push"", every time I see one I   think there might be another devastating infarct causing clogging just   around the corner, because it's frightening enough to learn that ""seeing   stars"" is actually stuff in your blood vessels moving and rummaging   around, so seeing one move reaaaally slow, like Thomas the Tank engine   trying to get up that hill, that is REALLY, REALLY scary.

Several   ophthalmologists have looked at the eye, confirmed very subtle  arterial  crossing \[what the duck ever they mean with that, you can  never get an  answer that does not make you anxious and scared to  death!!!\], always  reconfirming that bsed retinoschisis that this  blessed god of ours  bestowed onto the innocent and helpless me, and  every time they examine  with the slit lamp and diluted eyes, I can see  the little tiny black  dots, for a split second, in each eye, where I  have lost vision and have  ""black holes"".

Those   black holes, absorb the object I am looking at it, and what I get is,   silvery white stuff in the middle, that replaces the object i look at,   and then a ""wormhole"" effect, that is grey-black and silverish, and   outside that sharp, round outline, normal vision reappears.

So   it's not what people may think, a destroyed spot on your retina  causing  ""black spots"", like looking into a black hole, or having black   splotches in your vision, no. Only when they point the slitlamp  straight  at you, and you can see your own blood vessels in your eyes,  then I see  tiny, microscopic black holes or ""ruptures"" in the exact  same spot of  the ""missing vision"" patches.

What's   really distressing is that there is no answer from a doctor, they all   say ""if you get blood pressure controlled it goes away"". Now my blood   pressure is an average of 122/78, and even when gaming or exercising,   doesn't go above 135/89 anymore, like it used to, for short moments, I   even have low BP of 116/72, and when laying down, 116/72-78 and even   lower.

The  vision problems  persisted and only one doctor has asked me ""can you  live with that?""  and I was going to say no, but smiled and said ""i  guess"". But no, this  is taking my life force away from me, demotivates  me, and is a  neverending spiral of seeing every dot in my vision, every  blink, every  tiny white speck of light, as a new infarct that destroys  my eyes. I  have lost lots of motivation, gained depression, and I eat  several  psychoactive medications, with Benzodiazepine being the icing on  the  cake, I just feel like knocking out cold when it's really bad and I   head to take a benzo, and go to sleep, for a whole day, and can do   nothing, nothing, nothing at all, no work, not even feed myself,   sometimes, nothing.

I  see no  point in psychotherapy or other help, because I am losing my  blessed  vision! I had vision since I was born, and I am losing  it, at 30ish, I  was hoping to still be a ""gamer grandpa"" and not  devastated by an  illness I have no control over, and that noone can help  me treat.

There's   got to be someone with the same symptoms, but every time I read, I see   the blessed ""floaters floaters what you see are floaters"", I know how  they look, floaters are  mostly harmless, I don't give 5 cents about  floaters, what I see is DIFFERENT!

I   need to know what these squiggly clogging up silver light lines are   that pop up in my vision when I look at my monitor, or the sky, and what   the Professionals, the Doctors and Professors think and know about   this, there has to be some literature that explains what this is!

For months now I have been experiencing the following symptoms:

- Excess eye crust after waking up
- A lot of yellow-y eye mucus 
- Random burning sensations 
- Always irritates eyes 

These symptoms seem to worsen at night, and I’ve tried a myriad of eye drops. The first and second time I went to the doctor, I was told I likely needed to try some medication like lotemax and that this was powerful, and should do away with my symptoms. After I ran out of this medication my parents bought me pataday, and other miscellaneous eye drops. All over the counter. None seemed to help. 

I went back to the same doctor and he once again prescribed these same meds. He said I was likely allergic to something in my home and that my symptoms indicate this reaction was due to an allergen. But he obviously didn’t know what. I’m going to college (depending on COVID) in the fall and he wanted me to see whenever my symptoms were better away from home.

That’s fine and all but I cannot stand this feeling any longer, and I can’t bear to think about forever being in discomfort while at home. Is there a way to find out what exactly is causing my eyes to do such a thing?

i6xnei,Pink eye Dendrites/pseudodendrites,"Just posting because I am very anxious and don't see the opthalmologist until Wednesday and my vision has become more constantly blurry this weekend. Any info/advice is appreciated.

I saw an optometrist Thursday, and she diagnosed me with dendrites or pseudodendrites with possible early ulceration in my right eye. Can only be seen under magnification. (I was difficult to properly diagnose because I could hardly keep my damn eye open and from rolling back despite holding my lid open)

She tried prescribing antiviral drops, but they are no longer available in Canada. She was hesitant to prescribe oral antivirals without the input from the opthalmologist. She recommended continuing polysporin eye drops as a prophylactic to prevent a secondary bacterial infection. 

The optometrist really wanted me to see an opthalmologist on Friday, (day after the appointment with her) but it wasn't possible. The absolute earliest I could get was this coming Wednesday. 

What would an opthalmologist do that an optometrist can't? Will my vision be permanently affected?
Should I go to the hospital to see if they can get me in to see the opthalmologist earlier (Im not even sure that's a possibility)


History:
26yo female. 

Past history of dry eyes (dismissed by my regular optometrist) multiple occurances of allergic conjunctivitis affecting the right eye worse (makeup triggered).
No contacts, and haven't worn makeup for over a month.

I have had pink eye symptoms for 13 days now.
Got it two days after gastro/food poisoning with a horrible fever.
At first, the eye had increased tear production, lots of warm, itchy irritation and some discharge (minimal - usually only in the morning). Seemed like run of the mill conjunctivitis.

After the first two days, the inner corner of my eyelids started to have some swelling, and the water line of my lower lid had a small raw patch near the tear duct. Some of the ?meibomian? ducts along the water line were a bit swollen. 

From the beginning, I used Refresh eye gel which helped to clear up discharge in the morning. I also used a cotton swab with eye drops on it to clean up my eyelashes and the corner of my eye so I would minimise touching it.

The eyelid swelling and tear production cleared up by the end of week 1, but I developed deep pain and light sensitivity with a little bit of blurriness.

At that time, I went and bought the polysporin eye drops just in case/to see if it would speed along the resolution of my symptoms. The pharmacist told me to make an appointment with the optometrist.

Over the weekend, the blurriness of the vision worsened and the tear production has dropped since Friday meaning my eyes are constantly dry and in need of artificial tears/gel. 

To my knowledge, I have never had herpes simplex - never had cold sores, genital sores.
I didn't have any kind of rash near the eye or forhead at any point before or during this ordeal.
I also havent had any symptoms of shingles, and am not in the at risk age group.",1,1,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/i6xnei/pink_eye_dendritespseudodendrites/"")",2020-08-09 20:49:22,

i7zqdc,Could my opthamologist have missed a retina detachment?,"Hello,

About a month ago I started seeing a lot of dark floaters with my right eye. They were static and were following my eye movements. And from then on I started noticing that I'm seeing really blurry with that eye when I put it under some stress.

I have been diagnosed with (nearsightedness I guess) +0.5 diopters in this same eye about a year ago.

It's important to mention that in the last 3 months my eyes were under a lot of pressure as I was studying for my graduation exams. I'm talking about 12+ hrs a day of computer time for three months. I know that it's bad at that time the exams looked more important than anything.

So with all these symptoms I went to an ophtamologist about two weeks ago and he told me that he doesn't find anything serious (I believe he was reffering to retinal detachment, as this was one his concerns when were talking on the phone prior to my eye examination), but he told me to keep an eye on my symptoms and if I were to begin to experience flashing to go to to a doctor ASAP.

I don't think I've experienced flashing since the exam, but I kind of feel that the vision in my right eye is getting more blurry. I could be imagining things, idk. I'm just worried.

Can you give me some advice? I can't go to the doctors' for another week because of personal reasons",1,22,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/i7zqdc/could_my_opthamologist_have_missed_a_retina/"")",2020-08-11 13:44:51,
i838nc,Withdrawing from steroids?,"Withdrawing from steroids??

Had been on tapering schedule of  lotemax 3 times/ week for a full week without any issues until symptoms started below.
sorry if it’s long... was trying to be as specific as possible.

**Started last Monday night(8/5)**: Intense burning aching pain in right eye that also caused insane headache but dissipated in about an hour

**Tues(8/6)**: those same symptoms on and off all day long 

**Wed(8/7)**: checked in with ophtho. He said there was a bit of inflammation going on in left corner of right eye- along nasal cavity. Was put on lotemax 4 times that day. And Twice a day for two weeks starting the following day.

**Thurs**:  had that extreme burning aching pain again, worst migraine of my life, heart racing, felt like I wanted to faint. Called doc on call and he said to put an extra drop of lotemax in for the night (total of 3 drops) and to come in to get it checked tomorrow just in case. But after I put in my second drop for the night, I felt completely fine so I didn’t do the third.

**Friday**: checked in with ophtho again and described symptoms of last night. Said there was a bit of inflammation going on still, but no break in epithelium of cornea or anything abnormal. He said it’s probably that I was having rebound inflammation/ was withdrawing from the steroids. Kept me on lotemax twice a day until my official follow up on the 20th.

**Since the weekend**, it’s been different like every day. I’ve been having on and off pain and headache. Some days  my eye feels great though. Other times, my eye feels like there’s this stabbing aching pain( like someone stabbed it with a small knife and left it in there) with a terrible headache. Steroids have helped a little but haven’t helped anymore as much as it did the previous days.

**Today** I had that pain, took a nap and it felt better, but then there’s been the lingering uncomfortable small aching feeling in my eye( like something might be in it). Really have  felt extremely aggravated all day bc of it for some reason and I’m never usually aggravated for anything.

Pressure was 21 in right eye on Friday. Controlled with timolol and lotanoprost as I am a steroid responder. 

I’m 21, Have a HX of herpes Keratitis in right eye. 

Is this truly symptoms of rebound inflammation/ withdrawing from steroids??? Or could something else be truly going on? Didn’t think withdrawing from steroids was a thing tbh lol, but it’s driving me absolutely NUTS. Feel like I just want to cry sometimes bc of how frustrating, uncomfortable and sometimes painful, it’s been and can’t really focus on anything while that’s going on.

Dont notice any changes in vision. There’s no redness or anything that I can see.

i9576f,When will my bad luck end? I am bound to become blind?," I am highly myopic - my rx for my right eye is about -7.75 for right eye and about -9.5 for left eye with bilateral lattice degeneration. So I had 3 laser retinopexies in the last 4 months. I had first laser session about 4 months ago in april this year to seal a retinal hole on the superior portion of my retina in my left eye. This (atrophic) hole was symptomatic and was suspected that retinal fluid could pass through it and put me at higher risk of retinal detachment. The second laser retinopexy was done in the first week of July to seal „new suspicous areas of lattice degeneration placed inferiorly” in my left eye. I was told that I could still see flashes after my laser retinopexy but it is normal and no one can tell when they will dissappear and that I should book my appointment ASAP if they increase in number. But I was still concerned with my ""new norm"" because I was still getting a lot of flashes (like about 50 a day in my worst days) so after contemplating my issues for quite a long time I decided to book an appointment this time with different retinal specialist. The retina surgeon found I have an atrophic retinal hole with subretinal fluid at 11 o'clock, the area around the hole was detached albeit it was small and isolated and he was looking into my eye for several more minutes before deciding if I should have another retinopexy or schedule me for scleral buckling surgery. In the end he decided that he will do a laser retinopexy and he scheduled my check up appointment in 2 weeks to ensure that this area is stable and if not (God forbid) then scleral buckling will be my next step - he estimated my chances are at least 50% that the lasered area will hold successfully. Right now I am devastated with my situation I hope that I won't need further surgeries. My anxiety shot through the roof because I fear I may go blind in not so distant future. Why is this happening to me so **aggressively** ? I had no problems up until the last 6 months when I got first flashes. Vision is very important to me and the last atrophic hole needed a mere month to develop small amount of subretinal fluid and this was probably the most sinister finding in my whole life so far when it comes to eye health. I'm about to start 4th year of dental school and I enjoy the classes and do well in my degree but these events bring me worrying thoughts that I may not be able to continue my future career path because my vision may fail me in the future. Fortunately as of now I did not suffer from any vision loss and have corrected vision of 20/15 in both eyes but I don't know what to do right now. I'm planning to visit my retina specialist every 3 months (or earlier if I have suspicious symptoms). I think this is the only way to prevent any damage when it is in the beginning stages. I believed that the 6 month follow ups are enough but I suspect that I would experience a full blown retinal detachment in the near future if I waited any longer. On top of that I didn't even know that I have another atrophic hole that heightened significantly my risk of having RD because I didn't note any new significant symptoms other than my flashes which were arguably within my ""new norm"" range, no curtain, no new floaters besides that. I was thinking that rushing to my doctor's office two days ago would be an overkill but again my guess turned out to be right. Don't take this the wrong way I would like to finally be proven that my guess was not justified and that I don't have any new insidious retinal finding that puts me on the verge of having a retinal detachment.

i9rhsd,"(19M) Floater obstructs vision, no improvement","I have a very long strand with a bunch of clumps around it that drifts around the central vision in my left eye. Floaters don't usually bother me but this one is just super annoying, it swings around and obstructs my view and hasn't improved in a month. It's also a lot more ""clear"" than the rest of my floaters and I can see it in way more lighting conditions than usual.

I'm think I might've always had this floater and it was in my peripheral vision, but I noticed it way more after I was hit a few times around the left eye and head with a possible concussion 5 months ago. I’m not sure if this caused/worsened the floaters or if I’ve always had it and it moved into my vision, just that I don’t remember having one this visible and obstructive in the past.

I saw my ophthalmologist last week (myopic with -4 OS/-4.25 OD) and I mentioned the trauma and floaters to the doctor. He just offhandedly said that the left eye looked fine and didn’t see any floaters. (I did have some retinal tears that got patched up in the right eye)

It’s been a little frustrating seeing no real improvement with the floater when both the optometrist and ophthalmologist says they go away over time.

i9udfp,Which Lenses Are Best for Me?," Hello,

Not sure if this is the best forum for this but thought I'd give it a shot. First, a little background:  I've worn glasses since I was 3 years old (32 years total) so at this point in my life, I have a good idea of what works for me. That said, I'm open to an unbiased opinion.

Whenever I update my glasses, I typically purchase two pairs: everyday use and sun glasses. For the everyday use, I typically use a digital (or HD...forgive my ignorance of the marketing vs. practical term) high index lenses (1.74). Same applies for the sunglasses although I have been told the highest refractive index available to me for polarized lenses is 1.67.

Am I making the right choices here? Should I consider something different?

When I first tried the digital lenses, I did notice an improvement so I've stuck with them. I've always wondered if I was getting ripped off, though, because the price points are fairly high.

Rx is as follows:

* \-8.00 -1.50 x 155
* \-8.75 -0.50 x 75

My usual vendor is Pearle Vision. I'm not beholden to them, but they know my history and I've never really had any issues.

i9x38w,[32F] Could this be a retinal migraine?,"32F, 5'3"" and 139 lbs, white, small scintillating spot in my vision (left eye). No drug use, diagnosed with general anxiety disorder. Medications: ketoconazole 2% shampoo for seborrheic dermatitis. I also take a prenatal vitamin and iron gluconate for low ferritin levels. Not currently pregnant.

I messaged my ophthamologist but don't expect to hear from her until after the weekend, and I also spoke with a triage nurse through my eye center who believes I'm experiencing a migraine, but after I spoke with her, I experienced episodes two more times. While I don't think it's an emergency emergency, it has me freaked out. I'm nearsighted, about -4 and -4.5, with astigmatism in my left eye.

For the past couple of months, I've noticed I sometimes get a little spot in my vision that looks almost like TV static. It's normally about the size of a thumbnail held out all the way from your face. As far as I can tell, it's consistently been in my left eye. When I blink I notice it right away, and then it gradually seems to fade until I blink again, and it becomes clear. I don't see it when my eyes are closed. And sometimes if I'm looking at a bright or colored wall, it mimics an afterimage--so it may look red in color. It can last anywhere from 5-60 minutes. I haven't been able to identify a trigger, but I think sometimes it happens with bright light (like a TV or computer monitor). I chalked it up to vitreous changes with age. Sometimes it happens a few times a week, and sometimes it doesn't happen for two or three weeks.

Today I had an episode, but noticed that the spot was also blurry--I could see text, but it was too blurry to read. This episode lasted for just under an hour, and went away. Then I noticed it again a few hours later, but less severe and of shorter duration. And then again a few hours later, also less severe and shorter. I have a slight headache, which may or may not be from my nerves.

I don't have any other symptoms (no weakness, my speech is fine). Could this be a retinal migraine? Is there anything else I should investigate to rule out?

FWIW, I've had vision issues for a few years now with the appearance of floaters. 2 years ago I had issues waking up and seeing a dark circle in my vision that quickly dissolved. I had a full neuro opthamologic workup 1.5 years ago (but no MRI) and everything appeared healthy, so they thought I was sleeping on my eye and the pressure was causing the circle. I sleep with my head elevated now and typically don't have issues.

I've also uncommonly experience migraines with aura, but the aura has always been a typical aura--long, flashing lights that get larger in my peripheral vision, in BOTH eyes.",1,15,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/i9x38w/32f_could_this_be_a_retinal_migraine/"")",2020-08-14 16:45:04,

Hi guys! 
I have a question for you! I’m extremely anxious and afraid when it comes to eye stuff and maybe you can help me to calm down a bit. 
For a year now I have every now and then a flickering in the left upper corner of my left eye. 
It looks like the flickering of a TV with no signal but kind of translucent and maybe a tiny bit brighter than normal. Or when you press your eyes together very hard and then open them again and it’s kind of flickering? It looks like that but very small. 
I have been to three optometrists yet because I didn’t know that there are different kinds of eye doctors. I’m not from amerika. But they took a picture of my retina with an optomap and they say it looks very good and healthy. 
I don’t have any pain or redness and I don’t have more floaters than usually. 
Also: My left eye does have light astigmatism. 

I was wearing a slightly wrong prescription for a year though and my upper wisdom teeth are coming in. I don’t know if that could be related. I also had very low B12 for a year or so. 

I have an appointment with a retinal specialist next month but I’m freaking out that I maybe have a tumor or need surgery. 

I also have things thing since I’m a kid that whenever I look at snow or fog or bright surfaces I would see a moving white spiderweb. My doctor once told me as a child that people just see things differently and that that’s nothing to be worried about.

Issue with right eye

Ok so I have a question and will be seeking out a medical opinion on this matter. 

A little background in February of this year I went in for a normal eye examine. Upon said completion of exam I was referred to an ophthalmologist, due to the discovery of a small nevus in the retina of my right eye.  I proceeded to go to appointment, as I was squeezed in less than a week after my eye exam. After the initial evaluation, my ophthalmologist reported that he saw hypertensive retinopathy, as well as lattice degeneration, visual opacities, and retinal holes. He seemed less concerned about the nevus in my eye (side note he also did an ultrasound on the nevus). I went for a second opinion and the second doctor also sided with my first doctor. I proceeded to have laser barrier treatment for the retinal holes. The left eye procedure went as a planned and had no hitches. My right eye, though, there were issues. A week after surgery I noticed that my right eye was still dilated. At the two week mark, post surgery, the dilation subsided; however a new issue arose. I was now noticing that I was seeing haze, at times, or my eye was seemed “weak” after removing my contacts. I soon found the issue, or so I thought, as it appeared my optometrist had changed the axis on my contacts from a 20 to a 10. Everything else stayed the same. I proceeded to try on my old prescription and the issues resolved.  That was until about 3 days ago when I noticed that my right eye seemed blurry. I changed the contacts to a new pair but still the issue persisted. I finally relented and tried on the “new” axis power and I can see fine again. My question is has anyone gone through this? What can be the reason? As mentioned I’m scheduled for a 6 month check up with my ophthalmologist in September but will be calling them to see if they can move up my appointment, in the hopes of addressing this issue. In the back of my head I can’t help but wonder if my nevus is causing this. For reference i do have astigmatism and has also diagnosed with corneal edema by my optometrist during my February visit.

ib0yjn,"Retinal hole in left eye, accompanied by increase in floaters – should I get laser treatment or fix my health issues first?","I am myopic (-5.75 L and -5.25 R) and have astigmatism. An optometrist saw that I had lattice degeneration, and sent me to an ophthalmologist, who said that I have a hole in my left retina and asked me when I wanted laser surgery to repair the hole. He was kind of blasé and curt (probably having a bad day), and didn't explain anything to me, so I didn't get a sense of how urgent my situation is.

The background to all this is that I spent about a month being severely ill with sleep deprivation (only microsleeping for days at a time), a dramatically altered consciousness, pounding vascular headaches, a sudden and sustained increase in my blood pressure (+30 mm Hg), and blurriness of vision accompanied by a noticeable increase in grey/black floaters. In the past week, I've been able to catch some good sleep and am seeing a neurologist for my issues, but I've done a bunch of scans and everything has come out clean—even though many of my symptoms persist—so this process of finding out what's wrong may take a while, perhaps even months. As of two weeks ago, I did not have any optic nerve swelling, although I can feel a weird subtle pressure behind my eyes, and I want to check it out again in the next few days to make sure I haven't developed any swelling in recent days.

I'm not worried about retinal detachment yet because I don't really see white flashes, although I sometimes have a sensation of flickering, if that makes sense. I have a lot of visual snow, most of them being floaters, which I think I have in both eyes, but more so in my left one. I'm wondering if the retinal hole in my eye can lead to more and more floaters in the short term, because a few new ones have cropped up in the past few days and I worry that my eyes are about to be overrun with floaters. I would say that before getting sick, I had one or two floaters, and now I have seven or eight (or maybe I'm noticing them a lot more)? Do floaters ""leak"" out of the hole? Or are they created by some other mechanism? Trying to decide if I should or should not do the surgery before I get the underlying health issues (that might have caused this sudden onset of floaters) fixed first.

ibo5ri,Vision after retinal detachment,"32 year old female extreme myopic here (-16).
I had lazering due to retina years in both eyes done in 2012. And I a scleral buckle placed with additional lazering done on aug 15th of last year for a retina detachment in my left eye. It was a macula on detachment. I never saw a black vale or anything.  I had black spots in my peripheral which turned into blurry peripheral vision and then loss of depth perception.  At that point my retina specialist noticed the issue. Reattachment was successful and vision is fine. 

Im now have some intense flashing.  Like a floater that flashes.  I've gone in before for this symptom and my specialist always says its fine. It comes and goes but for about 2 weeks it's been quite persistent.  Anytime I change rooms with different lightening it flashes.  
Is this normal? Just my retina doing crazy stuff or is this something to go in for? 
I just saw him for my semi annual check up in July and everything was ok.

And can de-stressing help my dry eyes?,"I started taking restasis about 2 and a half months ago and might be getting some slight improvement in my dry eye from it, i really cant tell yet. My eye doc said my eyes don't look inflamed but still put me on it. I also know that my lacrimal glands could be inflamed but she could not tell if they are im guessing? I know restasis works by reducing inflammation. I also took preservative free prednisone which slightly helped i think, as well as alrex and lotemax before that but those didn't help at all. I find it weird that the prednisolone did not fully cure my dry eye if it is inflammation that is causing it. I am luckily getting restasis for free right now through a patient assistance program but I dont know if they will re enroll me and give it to me for free every year. I also really just want to go back to a normal routine and not have to treat my eyes and worry about my eyes everyday (ive been doing warm rag routine twice a day, bacitracin on my eyelids at night, avenova on my eye lids everyday and artificial tears since November and it's getting really tiring mentally to be honest). I am incredibly depressed from this. This dry eye started when i stopped drinking and smoking marijuana and was extremely stressed so I think stress mught have caused this.

ic1v3r,[26M] Sudden blurry spot in right eye for 20 minutes,"Earlier this morning, out of nowhere, I noticed a blurry spot in my field of vision similar to those small blurs that usually just go away from rubbing your eyes. But this time it didn’t go away. I figured out that it was coming from my right eye, and I tried rubbing it, keeping my eyes closed for a couple seconds, etc. But it kept getting worse and worse, and it got to the point where I couldn’t read the text on a paper I was looking at (it was still only part of my field of vision that was blurry though, but it was kinda in the center so it blurred part of the words). I also couldn’t type out words correctly on my phone. At this point I freaked out and kinda had a panic attack, and felt like I was losing vision in the eye entirely, although I’m not sure if that was just in my head or not. But then, just as quickly as it came, the blur went away and my vision went back to normal. 

The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes. It was exactly like a regular eye blur / cloudy spot, except it lasted much longer than they usually do. This was 2 hours ago and it hasn’t come back yet. 

Does anyone know what’s going on? This was really scary, partly because I was at work when it happened and my job involves operating heavy machinery (I had to get down from the equipment I was operating to be safe), and partly because I’m a bit of a hypochondriac so I often become convinced that I have horrible diseases, and now I’m wondering what this could be.

My vision stayed pretty stable for the next 4 years but I didn't get my eyes checked during that time so I don't know for sure. However, around a year back I started having difficulty with my old glasses so I went to an optometrist. This time my prescription was 
-2 SPH and -0.5 CYL in LE
-2 SPH and -0.5 CYL in RE

I had retinopathy and a corneal tomography done. I was told that I have matrix degeneration but my retina is still healthy and a rather thin cornea but no keratoconus. I have no other health issues but I have been taking birth control since last year. 

Is it more likely that my old prescription was wrong or did my rx jump a whole 3 D in both eyes? Can high screen time and poor lighting really cause this much damage?

I wear contact lenses most of the time during the day. Wearing glasses for an extended period to try and 'fix' the issue has made little difference.

My optometrist confirmed that there was some superficial scratching on my eye surface (evidently it was worse on the problematic eye). He suggested using Retaine MGD drops, and was confident that they were suitable for use with or without my contact lenses. 

Used these for a month or so with relatively little change in my overall condition - sometimes I wonder if these particular drops may be contributing to clarity issues with my lenses, but I'm not sure.

I use the newest opti-free solution. Is there a potentially better option for me to try in terms of a daily cleaning solution? I have read that the H2O2 solutions may be more effective for dry eye sufferers. I've considered switching to a daily contact lens instead of the 2-week lens I currently use, but I'd like to see if there's another way to go about this first.

It's worse in my left eye but present in my right eye as well. My eyes feel dryer than normal, but even when the aren't dry the blurry vision persists. I noticed my eyes were blurry before I noticed they were dry. The blurry vision has fluctuated in severity slightly depending on the conditions. For example, earlier I was grocery shopping and I think the AC made it worse. I feel like bright light is affecting me differently, but I could just be anxiety. I have observed no other changes in my health.

So for the last five months, I've been spending an obscene amount of time in front of a screen for work and recreation. Probably ten hours a day.

  Are the effects of eye strain known to last days, even after cutting down on the straining habits?

I’m a 19 year old female with no health problems. I was born 3 months prematurely (27 weeks I believe), and do have some evidence I suffered minor ROP. After a mildly severe concussion in April of 2019, I noticed my vision was slightly worse. Given that I’ve had terrible vision all my life, I thought nothing of it- kinda thought I would ignore it and if it got worse I’d make an app with my optho. 

In May of 2019, I noticed my vision started dipping more, and fluctuating. My night vision became a lot worse, halos around lights became more unbearable, and my vision has been filled with black specs of floaters. I typically wear contacts, +5.75 and +6.00. As the months went on college became more difficult with my vision progressively worsening in fluctuation and my symptoms have become more difficult to work around. 

At first, I thought it could’ve been stress or anxiety. I go to therapy like it’s an amusement park. And I have outlets, my stress and anxiety has in no means worsened or has made my vision better. Needless to say, I’m not very stressed or anxious. Medications never helped the symptoms of my vision either. I was diagnosed with accommodative spasm and convergence insufficiency. I was dilating my eyes daily in order for the fluctuation to stop, but dilation comes with its own set of problems. I’m now doing visual therapy again (so no more dilation) and I was even doing it during the days I wasn’t dilating my eyes (so it’s been since February, 6 months). I haven’t even had a slight improvement, if anything my vision is getting worse. And I didn’t even notice that until I was in the shower today. 

I’ve accepted that my vision may always be stuck like this, but it has in no way made me more anxious or stressed. It’s just something I try and work around the best I can. I’ve been straining my eyes during work so I can see better so I end up with killer headaches. How long did visual therapy take to help/fix if it ever did at all? Even with 6 months, I would’ve thought I’d notice even the slightest of improvement, not my vision worsening.

idffm6,Tunnel vision and mental fatigue from unknown origin. It might be related? Where can I seek help?,"Hello everyone,

I'm a 30 year old male from Portugal. I've two main issues that I don't know if they are related, bad eyesight and daily fatigue. I don't smoke, don't do drugs, just drink one glass of wine per week. Don't have any other medical issues beyond the ones I'm going to describe. I jog weekly.

Eyesight:

On the left eye I was diagnosed with amblyopia. I see really bad from this eye. This eye doesn't have the issue below, although it has a small dot that cannot see.

On the right eye I have an internal scar, that is giving me tunnel vision (retinography and visual field on the link below), and the Doctors I went can't figure out when or why this scar appeared. The tunnel vision is slowly growing over the years, which is really concerning because that's the eye I use to read/work/etc. I was diagnosed with glaucoma in 2014, but in 2019 I went to a glaucoma specialist that proved that it wasn't glaucoma and the medication (eye drops) wasn't needed. I've some floating flashes on the affected zone when I get tired, anxious or there is sudden light changes.

Mental fatigue:

This is an old issue but it's growing over the years, I'm always sleepy, my mind is always foggy, it's very difficult to focus on things sometimes. When it gets worse, I get really nauseous, and it usually gets worse after some hours behind the computer monitor. I'm a web developer, and it's really getting difficult to work without getting nauseous after some hours (can't get to 5/6 hours of work now). I already went to the general doctor several times, two neurologists, a psychiatrist and a psychologist. I've made a CAT scan and a magnetic resonance, with no results. The blood tests are also good. I've also made a heart scan, all good.

I don't know where to go next. It's getting really difficult to work, getting the house chores in order, do the daily life without being exhausted all the time.

Is there any other health area that I can seek advice? For the eye and for the fatigue.

Do you think the two issues might be related?

Is there any Doctor in Europe that you could recommend me to seek?

Can you give me your advice?

Thank you very much,

I noticed sometimes if I wake up in the middle of the night and open my eyes, the same eye (right) has this weird pain. It gets super watery and it takes about a half hour or more before the pain stops and I can go back to sleep. I wake up the next day feeling like nothing happened.

I couldn’t even look out of the corner of my eye without the pain flaring up. I went to my eye doctor a few hours later, and he said it was probably due to inflammation because I had a mild case in both eyes. I didn’t really think that was it, and I kept questioning him if that could cause this intense pain. I took the steroid drops for 2 weeks, and he said I should be good but to call back if I wasn’t.

ieqj45,Eye am concerned.,"Hi. I’m a 27 year old female and have been having an eye issue since mid/late June. I am seeing an eye doctor this upcoming week, but my anxiety is sky high and I feel like any information is helpful. 

In June I started a new job requiring me to work from home and use a computer a lot more than I had before. Pretty much use the computer all day. I like to switch off and do some work that doesn’t require screen time throughout the day. Randomly my left eye got really red and gross looking. No pain, just pink/red, no sensitivity to light or any goop. Like any other 20-something year old, I called my mom. She said it was probably allergies. Made sense, because I liked to work outside on my patio frequently. Went away after 2-3 days. Wear glasses pretty much every day during work and contacts maybe for like 3-4 hours in the evening. 
Then early July I noticed a small pinkish spot near my iris, the side closer to my nose. Same eye. Used some eye drops after searching on the internet to find which ones would be best. I don’t remember what kind it was though because the box said discard after 30 days, so I did. I didn’t use it the whole 30 days. Just off and on when my eye would get red. Noticed it would get red if I would open my windows. Stopped doing that. Noticed it’ll be more pinkish in the morning but I can open my eye fine and there’s no residue coming out. 

Fast forward to today: this morning it appeared to be fine. I am watching my friends dog for only today and it was half pink after I took a nap (not with the dog). Anti histamine drop helped with some relief. Doesn’t appear to be as pinkish but isn’t perfect. 

I can send pics in a dm. Didn’t really wanna post them because it’s kinda embarrassing. It’s ruining my self-esteem and causing me stress. I’m just really concerned that it could be something I’ve over looked and I don’t know, I’m kind of freaking out. I’ve had some issues in the past where I’ve had to take prescription drops. Don’t remember what they were because it was during college. Last year when I went for an eye exam (in June) the doc made me wear glasses for 2 weeks and use a prescription drop for inflammation I think.... 

Just looking for a little insight on what could be an issue. Any help is appreciated so much! Thank you so much and sorry for the bad joke as the subject.",1,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/ieqj45/eye_am_concerned/"")",2020-08-22 14:11:06,

ifbyd6,"Duane Syndrome, bilateral hazy vision, entoptic phenomena- so many things!","Tl;dr. Yes I’m making an appointment. 51F, sudden onset of bilateral hazy vision and new entoptic phenomenon. 🤓

Problem: woke one morning with hazy vision not blurry - more like if your glasses were slightly fogged up, as well as tiny “floaters” that move with gaze.  Not painful, other than increased light sensitivity. No redness. 

Confirmed it was bilateral by patching dominant eye. The fog left the dominant eye after patching, but floaters are still there. I’m also very light sensitive, and the “floaters “ interfere with vision in the light, unless I wear sunglasses.

 I use screens, so I use some OTC artificial tears occasionally when eyes are irritated 

Aside from wearing glasses, I’ve never had anything happen with my eyes that bothered me until this. 

I also started EMDR 3 weeks ago, and this began the night after a session. People frequently report unexpected physical symptoms during this Tx.

Background/Hx : Duane syndrome, astigmatism, far-sighted before typical age-related visual changes, entoptic phenomena for as long as I remember, ditto for visual snow (which I’ve just learned is a thing). 

I also have tinnitus (for as long as I remember), deviated septum as well as some very serious congenital issues with other organ systems. I can’t help but wonder about some common prenatal neurological development issue. 

As a result of my history, I’ve also had numerous long surgeries under general anesthesia, as well as chemotherapy (16 years ago in 2004 -taxol/carboplaten). Also in 2004, I lost both ovaries and have not had any HRT - so no estrogen or progesterone since age 34

I’m on antidepressants. (You would be, too. 🤣)


Questions: 
1. I’m high risk for COVID complications, what should I ask or look for to be sure a clinic is practicing safely and understand the transmission risks? I’m in Seattle. 

2. What kind of doc should I see? 

3. Any ideas? Anything I should be sure to ask the doctor about? I can send images if it would help.

ifqpng,[27m] Mystery eye irritation at night,"I don't wear glasses or contacts. Let me describe a recurring situation which happened most recently this past night.

Woke up at 2AM. Right eye was very watery, there were tears all over my eyelashes and spilling out onto the outside of my lower eyelid. The eye also had a moderate stinging feeling(5/10). Right nostril seemed plugged up. Left eye was normal.

Got up, washed the tears out with water. Stinging sensation continued. Noticed that my right eye was quite blurry, looking at a LED clock for example the numbers looked blurry like I was looking through water, even though there didn't seem to be excess tears in my eye at that point.

Opened an OTC eye drop (B+L Soothe PF) and put 2 drops in my right eye. Instantly felt my nose unclog and a feeling of dripping in my throat. It almost felt like some of the eye drops went through my eye into my nose and down my throat(is that even possible?)  Waited a moment and put a 3rd eye drop in. Waited 5 minutes and noticed the blurriness lessened a bit and stinging lessened also(2/10). 

Laid back down for 15 minutes with my eyes mostly open. The stinging gradually went away completely as well as the blurriness. Slept and eye did not sting or water for the rest of the night.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this situation basically  is happening 2 times a week consistently for the past month, always randomly in the middle of the night with my right eye very watery. It started in April a few times, then didn't happen at all again until mid July when it started again randomly a couple of times a week. I had a dilated eye exam in early August because I noticed a bunch of jelly and smoke like floaters in both eyes but the exam didn't find anything unusual. 

What could be causing my eye to water so much at night, and what causes the stinging and blurriness? Always seemingly the right eye, and it never happens twice in one night. After I wash the tears out it's fine for the rest of the night, and never happens during the day.

ifvokh,taking lexapro with a family history of glaucoma? [27m],"Hi all,  


So I was recently prescribed lexapro for anxiety. Normally I have no problem taking medication, including psychiatric medication. However, when my psychiatrist sent me the drug info, a few things I read gave me pause and made me wonder about the risks.   


I noticed that one of the potential side effects was 'angle closure glaucoma.' This worried me because I know that my family has a history of glaucoma. My mother has it, and one of her parents does as well. It appears that I'm predisposed for this condition. In addition, my eyesight is already pretty bad as it is. I'm nearsighted; in addition, I also have a decent amount of vitreous floaters in both my eyes (which I've gotten used to and rarely notice).  


Given my current eye problems, and risk for future eye problems, I'm a bit hesitant to take this drug given the potential risk for glaucoma-related side effects.   


I'm curious to know what your perspectives are. I've read mixed things online, from 'it's not a big deal' to 'it will mess up your eyes' to 'it's ok but check in with an opthalmologist every now and then'. Of course, all of the perspectives that I've come across have been from laypeople, so I'm curious to know what ophthalmologists/the ophthalmologic literature would have to say.

Also everything in my peripheral vision is double and I am hyper aware of it also some things will disappear in my peripheral vision if I have it at the right angle.

My father also has astigmatism, but doesn't need to wear glasses unless he's driving for long periods of time. He's never mentioned anything about lattice degeneration or other issues relating to the retina. My mother has hyperopia. I got back from the optometrist today and here is how my prescription changed in one year:

Sphere, Cylinder, Axis
OD 2019: -4.75, -1.00, 180
OD 2020: -5.50, -0.75, 180

OS 2019: -4.50, -1.00, 15
OD 2020: -5.00, -0.75, 11

My optometrist told me I have lattice degeneration in one eye. I read the results of a study (Burton TC. The influence of refractive error and lattice degeneration on the incidence of retinal detachment. Trans Am Opthalmol Soc. 1989;87:143-157) that says 33% of lattice degeneration patients with &gt;5.0 myopia experience retinal detachment. I've  contacted my family doctor to book an appointment with an ophthalmologist, but it likely won't be for another month. I'm feeling really sick right now thinking about how my worsening vision will affect the lattice degeneration in my eye and what that means for how I'll be able to function in the next few years to decades.

Is the worsening of my vision huge? Is it enough where I shouldn't be worried about more clusters of lattice degeneration and retinal holes? I got my first pair of glasses when I was 9 years old, and my eyes haven't stopped getting worse since then. I understand that there are others with -9.00 in their eyes, but also get included in the 33%. Am I getting too worried? I don't know what my vision is going to mean for my career.

Fast forward last Thursday, floaters developed and my right eye vision started to have noises too that moves around like the floaters. Freaked out and managed to see an ophthal again. OCT apparently showed that its peeling off on its own a little bit at the moment, which she said that its a good thing. My vision should improve in the long run if it continues to peel.

I have a history of recurrent iritis and scleritis resulting from a form of colitis. Recently, I have been feeling its return - red eye, eye discomfort, bad headaches, nausea and increasing photophobia.

When my adventures in iritis/scleritis first began, I was diagnosed incorrectly with conjunctivitis before the better Drs took the time to assess me more thoroughly (weeks later) and found the real issue (iritis, at first) which was difficult for them to spot, but they got there.

Today, a new Dr (this is the NHS so there's little continuity of Drs) did the briefest check I've ever had and insisted that it was conjunctivitis, even after I expressed my doubts. Add to all that the fact that my household has been shielding so I haven't been anywhere to pick up conjunctivitis. But I was sent away with a tube of ointment.

My gut feeling is he has got it wrong, and that it is scleritis. I hoped some Drs here may be able to give me their takes on this before I do what doesn't come naturally to me and ask for a second opinion (I don't want to wait a week or more, enduring life-disrupting symptoms, only to eventually get a scleritis diagnosis.

iggaxe,"Near sighted, astigmatism, cataracts - monofocal toric lens IOL optimized for distance. Questions."," 

Hello everyone. I'm an early fifties person who really got the genetic short end of the stick when it came to eyes.

I am extremely nearsighted, and if I understand correctly, it is -9 diopters in my right eye and -7 in my left. I think my optometrist told me once that my vision is 20/400. I have glasses whose lens look like the bottom of a coke bottle. In addition, I have a severe astigmatism. My eyes naturally focus like 3 inches out. I can pretty much see stuff at the atomic level.

I have worn RGP (rigid gas permeable) lens for close to 40 years now (yes, I was placed in them at like 13 years old). I have noticed that my vision has gotten worse over the past few months. Intending to get a new pair of RGP lens, I saw my optometrist who informed me that I have cataracts. She also gave me a trial of some daily non-toric soft lenses.

I tried the new daily soft lenses and noticed quite an improvement (things looked a lot more vivid), then realized it might be a good time to just fix things completely and not have cataracts or mess with contacts everyday.. My vision is bad enough that, when I am on a computer or reading, I have for years worn ""cheaters"" in addition to the RGP's. I should mention that I am a long-time IT person, so I spend 9-10 hours a day looking at a computer. So wearing cheaters just for computer/reading I have absolutely no issue with.

I'm told my eyes are extremely long and shaped like footballs, and there is not enough tissue on my eye for me to be a good Lasik candidate. I was actually told by more than one person that Lasik would not be a good idea for me, and it could even be dangerous for my eyes.

So now I am having IOL cataract surgery on both eyes. I have chosen monofocal toric lenses.

I am not positive on brand names, but the surgeon uses Johnson &amp; Johnson products.

He has 3 tiers: Advanced, Custom, Basic

My questions:

The surgeon said he would NOT recommend ""Advanced"" multifocal lenses. He didn't go into a lot of detail, but based on that as well as other posts I have read here regarding how multifocal are not quite ready for prime time, I tend to agree. Would you concur?

I could have gone with just the ""Basic"" non-toric monofocal lenses, which would be cheaper but would only fix the cataracts and not address the astigmatism. I only plan on doing this once, so I'm going to pay for what he calls ""Custom"" monofocal toric lenses which fix the cataracts AND the astigmatism. This makes sense?

I have actually had monovision in my RGP's for several years. One RGP lens (my non-dominant eye I think) is for close-up. I had the option to do this with the new IOL lenses, but I've read that some people have a hard time adjusting to it. They suggested going all monofocal, and if I need to see some close up stuff for a few hours/a day, I could temporarily pop in a single soft daily contact lens from my optometrist. I think I really like this option because it makes monovision temporary -- I'm not committing to it permanently in my eyes via IOL. Make sense? Recommended?

For the monofocal, I have selected distance vision over up-close (hence the cheaters). I am told the focal point will be about 20 feet out, where my vision will be really good. Does this mean that, for example, that food on my plate will be blurry? I'm trying to understand how closely I can see something sharply (yes, I know that's subjective) before I need to put the cheaters on. Isn't the natural focal point of people with healthy eyes like 2-3 feet, where a person is supposed to sit in front of a computer screen?

I /think/ the situation I will be in post-surgery, had I had mostly healthy eyes all along, is the one I would have been in anyway with natural presbyopia -- I get into my early/mid fifties and I have to wear cheaters to be on the computer or to read. Just like other people my age.

Are there any other things with monofocal toric lens optimized for distance vision that I should be thinking about or concerned with? Any suggestions?

Any advice/thoughts /really/ appreciated.

ihrhya,ICL Nightmare -- Advice Sought,"I had ICLs implanted in both eyes in November 2019 at a well-known LA Clinic. While I had gone in with the intention of SMILE, the doctor convinced me that the ICL would be a better option for me -- and I was sold by the idea that the 'integrity of the eye' would be maintained.

The necessary LPI procedure was not well-explained, but I didn't see any reason to question it. The holes were placed at 3 or 9 and 6 o'clock (mirrored).

Nearly immediately after the surgery, I noticed pronounced double images and glare in my left eye -- particularly in high-contrast situations such as a room of bright windows, or driving at night. For every car headlight, there would be a dim, out-of-focus image below. Through experimentation (covering my pupil), I realized that the lower iridotomy on my left eye was in fact letting in enough light to produce a comprehensible, if dim and blurry picture.

I brought this to the doctor's attention immediately but my concern brushed off for several months and I decided to be patient with the healing process in hopes that it would go away. Alas it did not.

After drawing a picture of my vision illustrating the double-image, the doctor finally agreed that it was an issue and decided to operate to suture the hole closed. He assured me that it would be a quick 15-minute procedure. Alas it was not.

The procedure, for which I was not offered sedation, lasted over an hour and was clearly not going well. I kid you not that both the nurse and the doctor entered the room announcing that they would be operating on my good eye and it didn't get any better from there. The anesthetic was not sufficient and more than once I could feel the needle poking my eye. Following the procedure, I could hardly see out of the eye for the remainder of the day, and when I returned back the next day for my follow-up the pupil was still very constricted. The doctor sighed and told me that the suture did not hold and that he would have to order a tool and reschedule the operation for a month later. He noted that my iris tissue was thin and difficult.

The second procedure was also not quick and did not go well, but I was thankfully sedated. And I wish I were kidding when I say that the doctors and the nurses did in fact refer to operating on my good eye again before they realized. After over an hour, I was unstrapped and ushered into a waiting room where the doctor told me that the procedure was not successful. I asked about corneal tattooing, which he agreed was the best option.

At my followup visit the next day, the doctor changed his mind and insisted that suturing the hole would be the best path forward and to call and schedule it. 

Now, a week later, what was once a tiny hole at the bottom of my left iris is a jagged opening perhaps a mm across and the double vision is significantly worse. I don't know what to do -- I don't want to continue with this vision, but I also don't want to go back and see the doctor and ALSO since it was a cosmetic procedure I don't even know what my options are to have this repaired that I can actually afford.

ihtnjh,Best eye drops for sensitive eyes?,"Hello!

Oops, moving here, as it looks like   is more for professional questions. What are the gentlest eye drops out there? Is it possible to be allergic to preservative-free drops? What are the gentlest eye drops out there? Is it possible to be allergic to preservative-free drops?

Background- I am about 1 and a half months post ICL. It went perfectly (other than halos, etc that I was warned about so they don't bother me much) except now if anything gets in my eyes, (eye lash, water, etc) they go crazy. Seriously painful burning until I get it out. The doc recommended using eye drops to flush out my eye since I shouldn't rub them. Problem is, the eye drops are SO painful! I'm stuck because whatever is in my eye causes such bad burning that I can barely open my eyes, but putting in eye drops leaves me withering in pain for a good 10-15mins. I've never had to use eye drops before this, so I'm not sure if this is normal. I thought it was a ""drop them in and go"" type of thing.

I've tried TheraTears Dry Eye, Systane Balance, Preservative Free TheraTears, and Preservative Free Systane Hydration PF. With all of these, the first 2-3x I used them was perfectly fine, and then they started causing intense pain (except Systane- felt like I got stabbed in the eye as soon I put a drop in). My doctor was surprised that the PF Systane was causing pain and basically said it isn't damaging my eyes so I'm fine.

So I'm wondering if you have (or have seen) this problem before, and what you would recommend trying?

ij1evj,Medical Mystery," I want to preface this post by stating that no, I have not had sudden vision loss or eye pain, and yes, I've called doctors. I have an appointment in September and I have a general idea of what's the problem and what I need. However, I would like to see other guesses, as this has perplexed every single otho and optom I've gone to.

I have television static in my vision and sometimes see little white spots too, and little black spots or streaking lines in my peripherals. The television static is worse when staring off into the distance, at the sky, and things like that, and better up close. I have a prescription from 8 years ago for +1.00/+1.75 with an axis of 01-10 (I don't know the specific amount or the cylinder but last I heard, it was a positive value) because I can't see things well directly in front of my face. The last time they gave me a Jaegar visual acuity test, my eyes would not focus enough and I believe the smallest I could read was No. 10 or No. 9. 

As for distance vision... I come up 20/20 despite not being able to read highway signs until I'm right on top of them, and, one other pesky little fact.

Whenever my eyes get tired, I sometimes see double vision of object or, if I'm reading, a faint copy of text behind the other text. Text becomes almost embossed, though that's a bit hard to describe. They start getting sore. 

When my eyes have decided they've had enough for the day, regardless of how close I am, I think this is the best visual representation I can make. [Link](https://i.imgur.com/eujWP1n.png) However, that's absolutely worst case scenario, usually I only have the faint duplicate text or two copies of it.

Regardless of whether or not my eyes are tired, I sometimes skip lines in reading or go back to the beginning of the line I just started. Reading is difficult, and that's not for books up close with my reading glasses. 

I go to the doctors, they give me a visual acuity test at the same distance as the snellen test except its flat lines. They ask me to read from left to right, without moving my eyes at all. The letters on the left and the right sides start out hazy and fuzzy and only become clearer the closer they get to the center.  My diagnosis? I should try to relax my eyes more, I'm focusing too hard, and it's causing strain. Perfect vision otherwise. 

They told me to try drops (and I do) and tell me to preform relaxation techniques that may help me relax enough to stop focusing so damn hard on the stuff around me. And I try. I do give this my all. And this only makes matters worse.

Following their advice, I try to relax my eyes and stop straining them so much. Everything gets hazy and blurry. The outlines of items get smudged, like you used a fuzzy tool on the outlines and edges. The colors become meshed together into one blob, and sometimes I only register colors x and y because z pretty much melded. It doesn't matter the distance, this is for ALL distances though far, far, away may be absolutely indecipherable at all. And the more I let my eyes relax, the worse it gets. Eventually, I develop a fuzzy black hole right between my eyes, like a yawning grave that threatens to expand but never does. Usually my double vision comes back with a vengeance. I often can't use computers easily some nights as a result of my eyes getting too tired and my vision performing either this act of defenestration or the one I previously mentioned.

My 3D vision is intact, my depth perception is mildly poor but worse enough I can't judge distance. Possibly missing the very furthest degrees in my field of vision, though my eye doctors have never known what to make of the results of those tests because it's so mild.

Notes for further symptoms I am about to explain. These are not constant variables. Some of these I have once a week, some once a month, some a couple times a year or haven't shown symptoms in years. Severity is not a constant either.

I had chronic migraines throughout middle school. Sensitivity to lights in middle school, sometimes in high school, and once in a while in my  few adult years, which mostly means the lights hurt or feel uncomfortable but sometimes they hurt my head or my eyes. Dizziness as in the whole world is spinning and vertigo as in, even if I'm lying still with my eyes closed, my whole world feels like I'm on a tilt-a-whirl. Veering to one side while walking. Feeling lopsided, as if I am leaning too far one way or the floor is coming up to meet me or I'm seconds away from falling. My head feels like jell  every once in a while when I wake up, and on those days, I tilt to one side and everything around me feels like it does to. I tilt my head to one side whenever I am doing something and don't realize. Very, very,  watery eyes at times. Straightness is not a part of my identity and neither is it a part of anything I do. I recently almost lobbed off my thumb due to depth perception issues.

I often work better in dim lighting but anything electronic, the screen has to be as bright as you can go. 

Also, when I get double vision and close one eye, it DOES stop. Sometimes it also improves my dizziness and vertigo.

There might be additional symptoms I am not remembering and leaving out, and I should also mention I have autism and mild hearing loss.

ij2d4c,"After an object hits your eye with your eye lids closed, what should be expected from a healthy recovery and what could be a sign of problem?","A 15 cm long screw, weighing around 20 grams  (without sharp point, didn't cut anything) flew straight into my left eye in an incident yesterday. It must have been in some speed like 25-30 km/h but no more than that. 

My eye closed in time and I think it couldn't hit my cornea anyway, it hit well above the center but the impact was pretty strong. Just after I had a blind region in the lower part of my visual field (once the impact was on near the upper part of the retina), but it came back to (nearly) normal in a matter of minutes.  


I still had pain, specially moving my eye down, but apparently no visual problems.  


But, at night I noted there seemed to be a ""phantom light"" across a region in my left eye visual field, the same region that now seems to have a kind of ""afterimage"" all the moments I close my eye.  


It's a fuzzy figure more or less in this location in my visual field:

I'd say my eye could still be slightly swollen and mechanically stimulating that region while moving, but I'm  asking here just to be sure if there's anything worrying about it and what should I take care more urgently.

ij47qu,Atropine vs Cyclopentolate drops?,"So I’ve been using Cyclopentolate 1% drops to treat a suspected accommodative spasm (which hasn’t gotten better). And I read that they did a study on using Cyclopentolate drops on children with sever hyperopia and adults with latent hyperopia. I know the cyclo drops are shorter duration than the atropine, but is there a difference why they don’t treat the spasm with atropine drops? The cyclo drops don’t last enough time for me in an 8+ hour day for work (if my trial lenses don’t work there’s a 98% chance I’m going back on the drops.) 

Just curious to know why they’re different. I’m treating my dogs uveitis with atropine sulfate 1% drops (and some other meds prescribed from the vet), and I believe it’s for secondary glaucoma or pain relief (or both?)

ijq9dp,Out of options for suspected accommodative spasm treatment? What next,"
First and foremost, on mobile, so sorry. And I post too much in here but I need any idea to help me out. As you can see, I’ve been dealing with a suspected accommodative spasm for over a few years now, but it noticeably got worse after my concussion in April of 2019. I’m a 19y/o female with no other health factors that would affect the eyes. 

After doing visual therapy for months, we had to give up and switch to Cyclopentolate drops. Those only helped my mid range vision (and stopped the constant focus/unfocusing that happens 24/7). I told my opthalmologist I’m willing to trying to lower my prescription again (originally OS +5.75 and OD +6.00). He dropped both eyes down two powers. While I’m still trialing the lenses, my sight is just not holding up. It’s worse than it was with the higher powers. 

My ophthalmologist told me  “If this doesn’t work, we’re out of options.” I can see about 20/250 in the left, 20/90 in the right. My contacts correct only so much of it. Is there any other options for me? I’ve seen four different specialists, all left clueless. I would see a neuro optho but none of the specialists have a glimpse of something that would be disturbing my eyes neurologically. I’m not overly anxious or stressed, never to an amount that’s excessively abnormal. My stress/anxiety levels have never had an influence on my sight. 

What’s left for me to do? I can barely drive and walk alone. My depth perception has never been good, I can’t see in the dark well, very photophobic, and I have static like floaters. P.S. only reason I drive is because I’m legally allowed to, and I’m comfortable driving in the day. Not allowed to drive at night anymore. 

TL;DR: out of treatment options for accommodative spasm, what can I do next? Is there anything else beneficial out there for me.",1,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/eyetriage/comments/ijq9dp/out_of_options_for_suspected_accommodative_spasm/"")",2020-08-30 20:00:55,
ijsm6x,Atropine 1% eye drops... When will my eyes feel normal again?,"Hi! This weekend I had an eye-related emergency as a result of a migraine preventative drug I just started about a week ago (Topamax). My knowledge of eye anatomy is pretty subpar, but my understanding is that my iris was swollen in a way that was resulting in an angle closure of the eye's fluid system (potentially causing secondary angle closure glaucoma?). Thankfully I saw my opthamologist soon enough (and stopped the medication that caused this!) and things seem to be improving.

I'm not necessarily asking for medical advice, but more so hoping for a better understanding of what I can expect with the Atropine Sulfate 1% eye drops that were prescribed to me (along with some steroid eye drops). My vision is super blurry up close and my pupils are huge and I'm extremely horribly light sensitive. I have chronic migraines and light sensitivity is a major issue for me already, so the extra light sensitivity is really hard to deal with. 

I was told my vision could be blurry for up to 7 days after my last dose, and my pupils could stay dialated for up to 14 days... Does it really take that long? Is it bad for my eyes to try and read text while my vision is blurry? And is eye pain normal with light sensitivity? I had plenty of eye pain when this whole thing started and this pain is nothing compared to that, but I can't tell if this pain is from what happened with my eyes, or part of having my eyes sooo sensitive to light right now. 

If I have any major concerns, I will definitely call my opthamologist's office, and I will definitely ask these questions during my recheck appointment as well. In the meantime, any help with understanding how long Atropine will impact my eyes would be appreciated! It's worth it if my eyes need it to heal, but the side effects are killing me :(
