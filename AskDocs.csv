fh3an0,"Clear fluid from nose during ear/sinus infection, much different from usual runny nose. Could I have a CSF leak?","Note: Currently not an emergency, have already seen GP. 

24, female, 5’4/255lbs. Hx of chronic ear infections and ear tubes, currently have one in right ear but am in between tubes in the left ear. Also have slightly elevated HR and BP due to taking Vyvanse and Trintellix. 

2 weeks ago I began having symptoms of sore and swollen throat/tonsils. Saw GP who took one look and said it was strep. She also saw fluid behind left eardrum but said it was not infected—I didn’t have any symptoms there anyway. She prescribed 10 days of Amoxicillin. 

I took them per instructions and felt much better, and I finished the full course, but not a day or two later I developed a sore throat again. The next day I woke up with intense sinus and middle ear pressure on the left side. I could tell this time that fluid was draining into my throat and irritating it. I know the sensation of an ear infection well from years of chronic issues but since it popped up after a full course of abx I went to the GP again. They confirmed ear infection, prescribed me Bactrim, and sent me on my way. 

Here’s the weird thing though: I have clear fluid leaking from that left nostril every so often right now, since this morning. I don’t always get a runny nose when sick, I get super thick mucus and swollen passages which I *also* have at the moment. But the fluid is just happening kind of randomly. It doesn’t really line up with CSF leak symptoms other than that it’s happening while sitting up/bending over. I did feel a bit of head pain in the back when I bent over to grab something this AM but otherwise no actual headache. But I did see that high BP and obesity can contribute to risk....I also had some fluid in right ear canal but that makes sense as I have a tube so it drains as intended. 

I know I’m likely being a hypochondiac atm but I’m just super weirded out by a) developing another infection so soon after abx and b) having my nose run while being so swollen inside and full of thicker mucus too.",1,7,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/fh3an0/clear_fluid_from_nose_during_earsinus_infection/"")",2020-03-11 13:00:05,Physician Responded
fh3njv,Does twitching come up on an EEG/is it significant?,"Sup peeps, a few months back something happened and it’s been happening ever since. Doctores don’t know what it is but my doc sent me to a neurologist just to be sure it’s not epilepsy. 

I’ve had 3 EEGs so far. First one was lights flashing, last one (today’s) was sleep deprived. During all 3 of these I started randomly twitching. Most common in my legs\arms but I also noticed sometimes my pectorals would contract/ sometimes I’d be small movements in my eyebrow etc. 

Today though, I was told “try to take a nap” it’s kinda difficult to seep when you’re not used to sleeping face up/no blanket etc but again, sleep deprived so I started falling asleep at around 7ish minutes in. When I was drifting off, almost to the point of being asleep all of a sudden my leg jerked like a lot to the point of waking me up. 

The tech said he couldn’t discuss the results with me since he was just the tech/not the actual neurologist etc so I’m going to have to wait

Question is, would these show up in the results? Do they have any significance when talking about epilepsy/seizures/EEGs?

fjtxna,"My wife [34F] is 33 weeks pregnant, is the best case scenario for her to contract the Coronavirus now to give the baby passive immunity or to try to avoid contracting it but risk the new born contracting it?","Hi, I know this subreddit is inundated with Coronavirus posts but I didn’t know where else to ask.

We’re obviously very concerned with everything going on I was hoping someone could advise us. Firstly, we live in the UK and currently neither of us has any symptoms of the virus, however the likelihood of us contracting it is particularly high because I’m a paramedic and my wife is a pharmacist. 

Obviously, we have no intention of intentionally contracting the virus but we were considering what would be the more ideal scenario; for my wife to contract the virus and then to pass on her immunity to the baby via passive immunity, or to just try to avoid contracting the virus at all but then the baby potentially contracting it immediately after birth?

As I’ve said, that chances of avoiding it altogether are slim due to our jobs.

Hey there.

I'm a desperate husband. My wife and I have been trying to get treatment for her ingrown fingernails for, literally, months, and nobody has been able to help her.

This is an issue she has struggled with her entire life. Her fingers have always been swollen at the tips, and tender. In the past six months, this condition has worsened substantially. This issue is present on *all ten* of her fingers, on *both sides* of each.

It is to the point where she is having suicidal thoughts. She is in agony, all the time, and cannot use her hands to do anything. Lightly bumping a finger against something will send her to the floor. We haven't been able to hold hands in six months.

She spends many hours a week in the bathroom digging out shards of nail from the sides of her fingers in an attempt to lessen the pain, as you can see in the picture. She has a ziplock bag in which she has kept all the shards so she can show them to the doctor. The biggest problem is we haven't been able to find one who seems to care or be able to do anything.

I decided to make a post here in the hope that someone would be able to point us in the right direction.

Based on my research, she needs, at the very least, a partial avulsion of *both* lateral edges, followed by either an excision or chemical sterilization of the lateral horns of the nail matrix.

Thus far, we have done (at least) the following (over the course of several months):

1. Went to General Practitioner, he referred to dermatologist
2. Went to dermatologist. He prescribed topical antibiotics and topical steroids. They didn't help.
3. Went back to dermatologist. He said he couldn't help us.
4. Went back to GP. Referred to a different dermatologist.
5. Dermatologist Two said she couldn't help. Referred to podiatrist.
6. Podiatrist said ""we don't work on fingers"" and sent us back to Dermatologist Two.
7. Dermatologist Two referred us to hand surgeon
8. Hand surgeon referred us to ""general hand doctor who doesn't do surgery""
9. ""General hand doctor who doesn't do surgery"" said he couldn't help and referred us back to hand surgeon
10. Hand surgeon just called and said they can't help us

There is probably a lot more that I've missed in the list above. It's been a long time and I've lost track.

We are absolutely baffled that it's so easy to get ingrown toenails fixed, but *no doctor* we have talked to so far seems to have any knowledge of ingrown fingernails. We've talked to at least 8 doctors of different disciplines trying to find someone to help.

If anyone out there can please, please tell us what kind of doctor we need to see, or how we should proceed, I would be eternally grateful.

Thank you, in advance.",2,22,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/fkx98h/25f_desperate_ten_ingrown_fingernails/"")",2020-03-18 14:10:04,Physician Responded
fkyhek,Weird crusty skin flakes behind ears from some sort of liquid secretion 30M,"30M - For a while now behind both of the crease of my ears, I will wake up  with a lot of crusty build up that I wipe away using a paper towel or  something. Usually after this I experience some form of secretion that  is transparent and has a slippery sort of slimy texture to it. Lately  its been a little worse. Wiping my ears of the crust causes them to  become red because the crusty stuff feels like dried skin and has an  abrasive texture so I figure its causing irritation when I wipe it. When  I wake up and wipe my ears, there does tend to be a mild odor  associated with it but no other time is there any odor. I can't really  find any information though, the best I can tell is it could be some  type of fungal infection but information is extremely lacking. All I  know for sure is its been happening for a long time now. Its never been  nothing more than a small annoyance but there are days where the  secretion of whatever the transparent and usually odorless liquid are  worse after wiping the crust from my ears and usually depends on the  amount of crusty stuff I have to wipe to begin with. All of it can be  pretty variable but I would say generally there is always at least some  amount of crust or liquid secretion. I am assuming the liquid secretion  is what turns into the crusty stuff, but it don't feel like sweat and is  a secretion that happens exclusively behind my ears. I thought it was a  result of not cleaning well enough behind my ears but being sure to pay  extra attention when I shower does not seem to have made any  difference.

fpe6lq,Orthopedic question: Fractured capitellum in elbow - what exercises can I still do?,"Age: 19, Sex: Male, Height: 180cm, weight: 60kg, condition: fractured capitellum in the elbow.

About 6 months ago I fractured the capitellum in my left elbow after coming over the handlebars on my bike. For various reasons it wasn't assessed by a professional for quite some time by which point we assume the bone fragment had most likely died. In my particular case there are only a few activities which i have mild discomfort in doing such as fully extending or contracting the elbow joint and certain household chores.

I've spoken to an elbow specialist who said they would normally just reattach the bone fragment but that could cause complications given how long its been and possibly mean a second operation to undo it if it was unsuccessful. In the end he suggested that we leave it for the time being, keep monitoring it and do something about it if it becomes an issue e.g. It gets more painful.

The specialist suggested I am likely to develop arthritis (maybe 15-20 years down the line) at which point they'd probably see if there was anything they could do in an operation to help.

Question: I'd still like to exercise my left arm but the specialist said that doing heavy lifting is likely to accelerate the process of me getting arthritis. Are there any exercises or resources you could recommend that wouldn't put too much of a strain on the elbow joint but would still enable me to build upper arm muscle?",1,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/fpe6lq/orthopedic_question_fractured_capitellum_in_elbow/"")",2020-03-26 09:10:11,Physician Responded

- never had serious health issues, im 20, and try to be as healthy as i can. but this has been going on for now around 7-8 months ans i dont know what else to do anymore.
around september of 2020, i moved into a new apartment. a few weeks later, i started developing loose stool, abdominal cramps, gas, rumbling stomach, and general pain. As 20 year olds do, i ignored the problem for months until it completely altered my quality of life. the same symptoms with no consistent bowel movement or color over months.
i assumed it was a food intolerance!! so i kept a food diary, and started cutting out common allergens/intolerances. I have experimented with cutting out soy, FODMAPS, eggs, gluten, dairy. all seem to help for a week or so then back to old symptoms. so no help there- still not eating eggs or dairy.
i went to a GI doctor - after a thyroid function blood test, test for celiac, stool sample test for all sorts of things - everything came back normal??? so i went to my local clinic, got an std test and general bloodwork to rule out all options. once again, negative and normal.
so on paper i look perfectly healthy.
at this point doctors are no help. I assume it is ibs or stress related. so i take probiotics, prebiotics, and start meditating to calm anxiety. no help. i take digestive enzymes. no help.

I then think it is environmental-maybe mold in the new apartment. So I get an air purifier for the bedroom and anti mold dehumidifiers for the bathroom. No change.

please, someone - if you have ANY CLUE as to what the hell is going on, please help me out here.

Medications: Sprintec, Trintellix/Vortioxetine (20mg/day), Paxil/Paroxetine (20mg/day), Esomeprazole DR/Nexium (40mg/day), Xanax/Alprazolam (0.25mg, as needed)


Existing Conditions: Anxiety, depression, joint pain (likely from old sports injuries)


This all started the first week of November 2019. I have seemingly random attacks of vomiting and abdominal pain. The typical progression is: 


* Mild (3/10), poorly localized upper abdominal pain. Pain is gnawing or drilling in nature. More like a feeling of pressure and discomfort.
* Pain increases over the course of several hours to 9/10, inability to function. All I can do is curl up in bed or in the bottom of the shower. 
* Pain localizes to one of two spots: either under the left ribs in upper left abdomen or ~2” right of center in upper abdomen.
* I feel a shifting sensation in my upper abdomen and pain localizes, I vomit. It is intense vomiting, every 20-30 minutes for 2-4 hours. Everything in my stomach empties and lots of bile. It is so intense, I am completely exhausted afterwards and my abdominal muscles are sore.
* Often have fast heart rate and palpitations during attacks. Sometimes sweating/chills. Never fever. No nausea, it’s just like the pain makes me vomit.
* Symptoms are not relieved or made worse by urinating, defecating, hot, cold, changing positions, eating, drinking, etc.


These attacks initially were only 1-2 day events with a week or two in between. They have been getting more frequent and without gaps in between, now 3-4 days per week.


I live in a rural area, so the health system is limited. All of the doctors (my primary care, a surgeon, and an anesthesiologist) and nurses I’ve seen have never seen a case like it. 


Testing so far:

* CBC was normal, as were thyroid, liver and pancreatic enzymes in blood
* Everything normal on physical exam
* Abdominal ultrasound (kidneys, liver, gallbladder, spleen, etc) was normal
* Upper GI endoscopy was normal, with the exception of gastritis and esophagus damage. Biopsy was normal and negative for h. Pylori. We’ve tried 2 different PPIs and neither has helped.
* Abdominal CT with contrast was normal 
* Annual Gyno exam was normal


I’m scheduled to see a GI specialist in mid May, but that has already gotten pushed back several weeks and will likely get pushed back again.


Please help me figure out what this is, I’m desperate. I can’t work, I can barely keep up with classes. It’s so painful and is completely changing my life. I’m hoping my primary care doctor will actually see me next week like they say they will, but all they can do at this point is great symptoms and run more tests.


I guess some questions: What do you think might be wrong with me? What further testing do you think is appropriate?

So, I've been suffering with CPPS and HF for months now, but I have a question/symptom I definitely haven't seen addressed.

After using the washroom, having a bowel movement, my penis turns purple - mostly the glands. It turns a shade of purple that it never has in the past (before having this syndrome). It's as though it's trying to get oxygen but not able to.  After a few minutes it subsides and returns to normal, but it has me a bit worried. In addition to this my doral vein has a bulb near the base and is predominant throughout the penis. I assumed that was part of the CPPS/HF but now I'm uncertain.

But I'm also super worried because my doctor interacts with dozens of people every day and there may be a chance that he could pass along covid19 to me.

My father is on targeted therapy for cancer right now and has been really sick already for a while.

Is there anything I could do to guarantee that I don't get covid even if I get exposed to it? Or would it be better to just forgo painkillers for a while.

My doctor doesn't seem to be concerned about this at all and has said that old and sick people should take it onto themselves to isolate themselves and was criticizing the lockdowns when I went to see him for refills 3 weeks ago, so his attitude towards all this scares me as well as it seems that he's not even concerned about passing it onto patients.",3,11,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/fpzfmx/should_i_cancel_my_doctors_appointment_to_make/"")",2020-03-27 08:58:28,Physician Responded

&amp;#x200B;

First question - How do you calculate the current mortality rate of COVID 19 overall (so not specific by age and such)? Also, why is there a formula?

&amp;#x200B;

Current info as of 3/27 12:59pm-

&amp;#x200B;

Coronavirus Cases

&amp;#x200B;

ACTIVE CASES 418,497

&amp;#x200B;

Currently Infected Patients 418,497 

(95%) in Mild Condition (396,856)

21,641 (5%)Serious or Critical

&amp;#x200B;

CLOSED CASES 156,332

&amp;#x200B;

Cases which had an outcome:

&amp;#x200B;

129,965 (83%) Recovered / Discharged

26,367 deaths

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Second question- If there are 156,332 CLOSED cases, and 26,367 deaths world wide, then wouldn't the current mortality rate be around 17% on average currently? Rather than the low percentage people are saying?

I've never had symptoms continue for so long before so it's concerning to me. It's difficult to explain what I'm experiencing beyond Headaches and Fatigue. They both come in waves throughout the day with periods where I experience neither, but out of nowhere there is a sudden onset of both and I feel so tired that I can barely bring myself to do anything. My whole body feels limp and weak and my breathing feels kind of heavier. 

It feels similar to the fatigue you might get during a depressive episode, but I don't feel any worse mentally than I have for the last two years. And in those cases if I forced myself to get out and do something the fatigue would go away, but now it persists even if I try to do something active.

The headache is on my temples and forehead, and it's less a pressure pain and more dull and lingering. It is easier to forget about than the fatigue.

This effects me when I’m doing something like writing. Probably because I’m focusing on using my hand it starts to sweat A LOT.

fqruyl,Painful full body rashes,"26 years old

Male

6'4

194lbs

two months since first symptoms

Full body rash

no existing medical issues that I know. Perhaps a fungal infection?

I take no medication

For the past few months I have been experiencing frequent full-body rashes. The most obvious symptom is a painful prickly sensation which seems consistent with heat rash based on some googling. Unlike heat rashes though, my rashes will appear on my body typically when I do something that makes me hot like shower or workout and then disappear within ten minutes. I have tried wearing loose or no clothing, I have tried changing detergents and I have tried to think of a dietary change in the last few months, but I have yet to find any relief.

Over the past few weeks this condition has gone from something easily ignorable to something so overwhelmingly painful and frequent that I am having trouble functioning. I just got a full body rash from eating some hot soup. It used to happen once or twice a week, and only on my torso but has now spread all over my body, including my scalp and the back of my hands. 

I can't think of a preexisting medical condition that could be related to this. At one point I think I had a jock itch infection -- could that have spread all over my body? I can't find any information about fungal infections causing this. I also have tried OTC anti-fungal on my skin to little effect, so I'm not entirely sure. 

I am very desperate for any help at all. I don't want to take up space at a health clinic right now, but I am having a lot of difficulty functioning day to day with this.

fqsdyb,High frequency hearing loss jeopardizing my career in audio,"20m

5'10, 165 LBs

Have been on: Sertraline (current)

Seroquel (previous, 75mg max, 12mg minimum taper)

Minocycline (for acne, around a year)

To give a baseline, at age 15 my hearing range was 18hz to 22 Khz, which is about as good as human hearing can get. I first noticed issues with hearing while running pure tone tests on a new pair of studio grade headphones. My hearing no longer extended to 22khz; I was limited to around 18khz. Normally this could be interpreted as an equipment error, but this is impossible. I have a professional studio setup with a proper sound card, excellent studio monitors and 1000 dollar headphones. There is no potential for aliasing or equipment failure. I would go as far as to say that my equipment is probably more accurate than audiology grade equipment, and can produce a greater tonal range. Just to be sure, I checked on multiple devices, including the same pair of headphones, computer, and operating system I used when I could hear 22 khz. I got the same results.

I NEVER listen to loud music, or am exposed to loud sounds: my Windows OS volume is capped at 8/100, to put things in perspective. Still, I immediately invested in etymotic earplugs, stopped listening to music in the car, and immediately avoided loud areas. The loss in hearing has continued to progress since then.

I now can hear nothing over 15khz, which means in 5 years, with no exposure to loud music, I've lost 7khz. I felt that my career was jeapardized enough to warrant a trip to an audiologist, and was dismayed when they tested only 500hz to 12khz. I was told my hearing was immaculate and that there was no evidence of hearing loss. While the audiologist agreed that my self-test was probably accurate, she could only rule out conductive hearing loss.

Now I'm coming to you, r/askdocs , to try and unearth the cause for my rapidly progressive hearing loss. I've been checking my hearing weekly since I originally discovered my missing frequencies, and I'm pretty sure I'm losing about 50-100 hz every 2-3 weeks. I've already had to quit audio engineering, since I can no longer hear frequencies most individuals under 40 can hear. I'm now wondering whether it's time to prepare myself financially for the loss of my music career as well, because at the rate my hearing loss is progressing, I have about a year or two left before I can no longer effectively design sounds.

I have no known family history of hearing loss, although my father suffers hearing loss due to a lifetime of loud noise exposure. My mom is 60 and can hear up to 18khz using the same equipment I tested myself with.

Is there a potential solution to this problem? Or am I just screwed?",1,21,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/fqsdyb/high_frequency_hearing_loss_jeopardizing_my/"")",2020-03-28 13:57:00,Physician Responded

fqsjsg,Cravings are getting worse. Reposting due to no answer from any doctor.,"Male


Age: 28


Weight: 65kgs


Height: 6 foot 1


Medications/Drugs right now: None. 




Long story short, I became addicted to ordering off the dark net. 8 years to be precise.

There was a major thrill to this, because I had access to everything, and I took advantage. I tried pretty much EVERYTHING. Well, apart from ketamine and some research chemicals. Everything else has a tick next to it's name. Including heroin, and cannabis was used the whole time, as well. All day every day. 
My documented list is well over 40 different chemicals. 

I have an extremely bad case of HH since puberty (disabling, endocrinologists words not mine, though I agree) before all of this, which (please don't make any rude remarks about this, if you have questions, discuss it with a dermatologist, they are the ones who know the extreme mental effects of this disorder or consult this website made from dermos, it's accurate https://www.sweathelp.org/) is so bad that it took all of my confidence, self esteem due to constant degrading comments from others. All of this stopped me from attending work which assisted the social isolation which developed into social awkwardness, many other issues and habitatual drug use. 

Today marks 51 days sober. I did it all by myself and I received no help from any doctor, whatsoever.

There's a common trend and they all paint you under the same brush when it comes to this particular circumstance even though health is supposedly essential. Quite frankly, I think it's fucking bullshit the way I've been treated. I no longer trust them nor do I go to them. (Ironically here I am)

Anyways- I did see and learn valuable lessons over the course and understand now that being a doctor is simply a business, treating strangers they don't care about.

Today has been such a hard day with cravings. Its like playing tug of war in my head every 5 minutes. I just want DOPAMINE and to escape. I refer to this as going on a mental holiday. 

I feel completely miserable. I'm crying multiple times throughout the day, again with the intrusion of suicidal thoughts (I'd never ever attempt it) and I'm unsure how much more I can take of this. 

I'm really struggling. 

Based on my own research (because I've been left to my own devices) I suspect dopamine deregulation has occured and has presented in the form of depersonalization, depression, heavy anxiety, agoraphobia etc etc etc. I worry I have brain damage. When I talk my voice doesn't even feel like my own voice anymore. People can tell something's off with me further fueling my isolation. Things have become very odd and I've completely lost any connection I once had with anyone, so I don't bother. My mind does not feel present. 

Of course noone believes me, because strangely enough, I look completely normal, and none takes me seriously. You see, I don't appear like your average addict and it's really bitten me in the arse. 

I opened up to my family and it was a huge mistake, I was better off keeping things to myself, they don't understand how I feel inside and they themselves degrade me when we have arguments, calling me a drug addict, a failure etc. Complete ignorance. They don't understand the damage they are causing and unfortunately they are all I have.


I just want someone to calm me down or comfort me in times, such as today. Most days. And I don't have that. Someone to talk to me. However that's not the case and I realise it and understand it now. I'm alone in this battle. No one truely cares about another's situation until it's too late. Even then so. Life goes on for everyone.

I do know someone out there understands me though, surely there's someone. And I suppose that's why I'm here tonight.

These cravings are killing me and I need some relief otherwise I feel I'm going to cave, like today. I nearly did. I cannot let this happen and I eventually want to live a normal life.

The only one thing in my favour has been during this whole time (since I was 20 years of age) I have not had one sip of alcohol- it makes me really sick, so I've stayed away from it.

What the hell am I going to do, I don't have the answers, and I sure as hell don't have the social skills to navigate this world anymore.

fqslp6,Insensitive erogenous areas — is it worth going to a doctor for?,"22M 
Since I started having sex when I was 16, I’ve noticed that a lot of things that were pleasurable physically to other people weren’t pleasurable to me. I don’t feel anything if someone tries to play with my nipples, if someone tries to give me a handjob it ranges from numbness to pain, and if someone tries to give me a blowjob I only feel pleasure if I’m being deepthroated — I barely feel anything if someone tries to lick something down there. Same thing with (tmi) rimjobs - I’ve heard they’re supposed to feel amazing and there are a ton of nerves back there but I don’t feel anything at all when someone gives me more. The only thing that gives me physical pleasure is penetrative sex and masturbation.

I did dry masturbate a lot when I was younger, but I don’t anymore and that doesn’t explain the non-sensitivity of my other body parts. I also had a hernia surgery when I was 12, so I’m not sure if that had anything to do with it. I was thinking that I had a lot of painful and long-lasting erections during my teenage years, but that also still doesn’t explain my lack of pleasure in other areas.

This has always been really inconvenient and annoying for me but it seems like there’s nothing that can actually be done for me. Because nerve damage is pretty much unfixable right (like nerve pain might be able to be fixed but I don’t think nerve numbness can). Is it worth me spending money to see a doctor about this or get any tests done?

Bellow is the reddit post my boyfriend /u/CityHond011 posted on r/AskDdocs 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[23\] \[Male\]

This is a complex situation and has me both worried and perplexed.

I contracted genital herpes from my current girlfriend about a month and a half ago ( approximately 5th of feb ).

In an effort to curb the effects I took 3 days worth of my girlfriend’s Anviro. A dose of 500mg 3 times a day for 3 days.

I went to the doctor anyway and was prescribed Valasiklovir ( Anviro 500 tablets ). She advised that seeing as I had already taken 3 days worth that I stop and keep the prescription and take it if another breakout happens. The dose from my girlfriend’s stash cleared the initial infection.

We ( my girlfriend and I ) then had unprotected sex about a week later and one of us reinfected the other. Bare in mind we had no visible lesions at this time. The next morning I had lesions in a new spot.

I then started to take my prescription, however I didn’t read the dosage recommended by my doctor on the package. I was prescribed 500mg twice a day for 5 days ( a total of 10 pills ). I followed my girlfriend’s prescription and took 6 a day for 5 days ( a total of 30 ). The lesions cleared up, but a cluster of other bumps began to appear on the shaft of my penis. Not wanting to take more of the pills I left the cluster be.

I haven’t had sex since and the cluster is still there. In my frustration I decided to take some more pills ( between 21 and 23 of feb ). A dosage of 500mg twice a day.

The cluster is still there and I have what look like herpes sores dotted around my pubic area. Neither the cluster on my shaft nor the other sores have been at all itchy or sore.

Weirdly, the cluster I’m referring to was mildly visible at the time of the very first infection ( it was almost invisible ). It disappeared and then reappeared as mentioned above. Now the strange part is months ago before any of this I had quite severe chafing where the cluster is now ( from sex with underwear pulled to the side ).

I will send photos of the sores/cluster if requested. ( cropped appropriately of course ).

What is this cluster? Why won’t it react to the Anviro? Does the fact that I had chafing there have anything to do with it? Please help!",3,27,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/fr9tzf/unknown_lesion_on_the_shaft_of_my_penis/"")",2020-03-29 10:44:09,Physician Responded

I noticed these worm-like objects in my stool this morning. This is the first time I have noticed it. I haven’t been experiencing any itching, change in appetite, or nausea in recent days.

I *have* been having various digestive issues for the past couple years, such as bloating, stomach pains, thin stools, mooshy stools, stools with light spots, light colored stools, dark stools... you name it. But these things come and go in phases and never last long.

It wasn’t until this morning that I saw what *appear* to be worms for the first time.

The “worms” are the size of small pieces of white rice, except thinner. They were not moving. I have looked very closely, but cannot see any texture to them that I would expect to see on worms (such as bumps, patterns or ridges along their body).

I ate spaghetti last night about 15 minutes before going to bed lastnight. I also consumed some coconut protein powder mixed with water right before bed, which is very clumpy and heavy. Is it possible that either of those are the culprit?

I will check it cause ill notice myself feeling very out of it and kinda off and dizzy. Have had a lot of chest pain accompanying it. Sometimes like today though there was not much chest pain. Ive had a cardiac work up for it but its hard to know cause i have never been in a current episode of it when the tests were performed. Can a cardiologist explain why my heart beat sometimes is so weak and elongated. It freaks me out a lot and makes me feel kinda sick. Eithwr due to the issue or accompanying anxiety. Wonder if its random drops in blood pressire or stroke volume issue or something. Plz let me know if you have an idea.
Also will include. The cardiac work up was fine besides one occasuon on a stress test the doc aaid there was a change on the ekg and made me stop. Felt dizzy and not good.

frcb0z,"I have always had a lot of difficulty breathing, and chest pain, doctor's don't really assess and just say it's asthma but I'm certain it's not asthma.","I'm 23 F caucasian in Canada, I weigh 116lbs at 5'6"". I'm an avid rock climber and so in great shape except for my cardio for the obvious reason. I like to hike but it can be very difficult for me, I still do it. I don't smoke anything, no drugs, I do drink but not heavily, more so now because of quarantine but even then it's not daily or more than maybe two beers in a day. This has been my whole life but it's gotten progressively worse and thus more noticeable in the last few years. I am not on any medication right now. I was prescribed an inhaler but stopped using it cause I found it didn't help. 

Basically, I can't really breathe very well. Deep breaths don't exist for me, it's as though I have half the lung capacity of an average person. If I'm laying down, stretching (doing yoga), or wearing a heavy pack breathing becomes EXTREMELY shallow, and so it's much more rapid. If I slow it down it doesn't help and just makes me desperate for air. If I'm doing any stretches that involve my chest or wear a heavy pack it feels as though my chest has become so tight I actually can't breathe. As though there's something actively stopping my air halfway down my sternum. 

Training cardio doesn't help: when I was 17 I tried to run 5k, I trained for 6 months and could never run longer than three minutes because my lungs couldn't handle it. I can't go faster than a fast walk for longer than three minutes now because I can't handle it, doesn't matter how much I train, my lungs give out. The coppery taste you get in your mouth when you run I have from the get go, and the chest pain becomes unbearable about a minute in. After three minutes of jogging it feels as though I sprinted for a kilometer I'm in so much pain when I breathe, and it takes an hour for it to go away. If I try to do other cardio in a gym, I get incredibly faint (stairmaster, elliptical, bike) if I'm doing actual aerobic activity I feel like I'm going to faint within five minutes.

When I was born my lungs were messed up (underdeveloped despite being born late) and I had a surfactant dysfunction. I grew up randomly using inhalers but they never helped, and I had never actually received a diagnosis of asthma, I received inhalers to try and none really did anything for me. 

Last year I went for a lung test (breath test idk what it is) basically I breathe into or breathe in from a tube and it tests the capacity or something. It was incredibly painful, holding my breath was painful during it, breathing in deep wasn't possible and when I'd be told I needed to breathe in more for the test it would be extremely painful, like tears in my eyes. When I take an actual deep breath and fill my lungs it's very little I can take in, I was being asked to take more in because I should have been able to and I thought my lungs were going to explode. Blowing out all the air in my lungs is laughably a little amount. I was told there were problems in my test but not told what they were or heard any more about it, I had to call my doctor repeatedly to get an update and then I was just given a prescription for an inhaler that didn't help. 

When I speak of chest pain it's not even looked at because I'm too young for there to be anything wrong, and it's not my heart I'm certain, it's my lungs that hurt so I get it's not as serious, but doctor's don't really take this seriously when I speak to them they just say it's asthma and do no tests. 

It's getting to be quite annoying because it limits what I can do actively. I'm wondering if I still have a surfactant issue as I read that it's possible to retain it into adulthood. I can't do anything about it now because of covid, but I would like to at least know what to ask for when I can go in because I'm tired of being brushed aside because I'm too young to have any problems and they don't want to test me. It's affecting my quality of life, I have to take breaks when walking from class to class in college because my backpack restricts my breathing.

frce1z,"95, Female , Dementia no medications - stopped feeding herself","I have been the primary caregiver for my mom for over a decade now, she lives with me and I care for her while also working a full time job. I have a family member with her during the day while I am at work.  Her dementia has progressed to where she is now bed /chair bound , she does not talk at all. 

Starting two weeks ago she has stopped feeding herself, she also took her false teeth out and refuses to put them back in.  I used to be able to put a tray of food in front of her and she would eat it , now it is like she has forgotten how. If I put a spoon in her hand , her whole hand kind of shakes/trembles and she does nothing with it.  If you feed her like you would a baby she will eat, which is what I have been doing .All soft foods and ensure drink. 

She is on no medications and at her last check up a few months ago was fine except for the dementia and a diaper rash on her bottom. She has been completely incontinent for ten years now.She has also been sleeping so much I feel if I did not wake her up she would just stay asleep. I try to keep her up and awake for 6-8 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do not ever want to put her in a nursing home.  I have heard hospice can give advice but am leery of them and of course due to the pandemic do not want strangers coming into the house.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Is her not feeding herself due to the dementia?  do you think she had a stroke? (her heart has always been good)

2) Should I feed her baby food and ensure? She never wanted to live with dementia , she has DNR orders but I think no feeding is in regards to feeding tubes?  I am not sure where medical professionals draw the line. 

3)Her diaper rash has gotten really bad, she is pretty raw in spots . the dermatologist told me to use powder and destin which I have been . I have tried every over the counter diaper cream available Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated.

frcfp6,"Nails changing, concerned","Age: 28
Sex: F
Height 5'7, weight 220lbs, caucasian. 

I initially thought a nail just got bent weird but it's been probably over a year or more and it's two nails on my right hand now, my pinky and ring finger that the curvature of my nail has changed. 

The nails appear what I've found labeled as pincer or plicated. They make a sort of L shape making them point up on one side and then curve down on the other. Also the skin is pretty much always dry and peeling or cracking on my hands year-round. 

https://imgur.com/a/8Vrdsoz

The reason I'm concerned is because I have other existing health issues, some known some not (seeing specialists trying to get answers) and from reading about why the nails change it ranges from cancers, lung issues, heart issues, and psoriatic arthritis or being born with it which I was not.

I have been seeing a rheumatologist who has not found what's wrong with me except for fibromyalgia and problems related to joint hypermobility (looking into EDS), I am seeing a cardiologist who is sending me for further testing I made a post regarding that recently and there may be heart issues. I had asthma growing up and my lungs have never been great. My ANA is always negative. My CRP is always elevated (15-25 ish). Also have chronic migraines, endometriosis or somethimg causing dysmenorrhea, hypothyroidism, tinnitus, gastritis, IBS. Suspected POTS, suspected Interstitial cystitis both being looked into as well. I've also had my gallbladder removed. 

Medications: Synthroid, Vyvanse, Ivabradine, propranolol (new within a couple weeks), sucralfate, Loestrin, visanne, cannabis. 

There is history in my family of lung problems, cancers, heart disease and heart attacks, arthritis rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, MS and probably more. 

I don't know if I'm being paranoid about the nail changes or if they may actually be a further indication something is wrong or if it's an early sign of clubbing? It's fairly mild but it has definitely changed.",1,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/frcfp6/nails_changing_concerned/"")",2020-03-29 13:14:33,Physician Responded

I have recurring abscesses for which I have sought care for a very very long time. Most recently I had a Fistulotomy which was completely messed up by the surgeon as he operated in the wrong area. 

Since then I have had two flare ups. They put me up for surgery again but it ruptured on its own an hour before the surgery so they told me to let it go and consult a surgeon again. 

My appointment with the surgeon was recently postponed due to the current health crisis but I got another flare up which has again grown too big and too painful. I spoke with a doctor in an e-visit (telephone) and she told me to head over to the ER. 

My concern obviously is the Covid crisis and how the testing is far behind in our area. So far I have been isolated completely but this really puts me at risk. 

The pain is unbearable. If I just wait it out, am I risking too much? Like am I at risk for any medical emergency? Should I just put on a mask and go?

It felt like someone detached me from a physical conversation I was having at that time. I found it really hard to build thoughts and reply. It's as if a plugged pulled from my mind. It blanked out and I was miles away. Took me a while to recover but I was fine after that, just a bit shaken and jumbled. I felt so weird after that because the only time I 'blanked out' was once many years ago in a stress induced situation. There wasn't stress that night, I was relaxed and chatting.

I took a break from reading DID related content and tonight I went back into it again unknowingly. My mind felt like disconnecting from the world again and it took some effort to keep it focused on what I'm doing instead of letting it space out again.

Don't know what to feel about this. I'm really confused as to whats causing this trigger. Is it some mirroring neurons firing off? It's baffled me and I'm hoping someone can help me make sense of it. What do you call this and any idea why this happens?

I posted on March 22nd (exactly a week ago) that I had completely lost my sense of taste and smell the week before (on March 15th, exactly 2 weeks ago). This was after developing a cough and shortness of breath on March 10th.  I have since learned that loss of smell and taste is a new major symptom for cases of the coronavirus, which is concerning. I have been in self isolation since March 11th due to the  cough and shortness of breath, and wasn't even aware until posting last week that loss of taste and smell was a symptom.

It has now been exactly two weeks to the day since I lost my smell and taste, and I was just making this post to see if there is any more information on this symptom.

I am very aware that if I did/do have coronavirus, I have had it very easy, and this post is not me complaining about my situation.

I am just really concerned that it has been over 2 weeks of me not tasting or smelling anything, and was wondering when it would come back/what I can do to help it. I'm not sure what to do and not having these senses is disconcerting as I have never experienced this. I still have a cough that appears to have gotten a lot worse in the last 2-3 days, but my shortness of breath is slowly getting better. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Stay safe everyone!

He said the result came back normal and the nurse gave me a copy on my way out. A few weeks later I glanced at it just out of curiousity.

The multiple doctors I went to during my last genital sore outbreak basically brushed me off and misdiagnosed me. By the time I found a doctor who would listen to me, the outbreak had healed and she said unless I'm showing symptoms there was nothing she could do at that time. She has since moved to another state, so I dread the next time this happens to me and having to start all over in the process.

Anyway, sorry for the long winded post, but I'm just hoping to get some answers. Thanks in advance!",2,10,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/fsjk5l/27f_my_thyroid_test_came_back_normal_but_there/"")",2020-03-31 12:33:26,Physician Responded
fsjpfy,Inconclusive covid-19 test.,"My husband 37M, Atlanta,GA, early onset parkinsons and history of sinus issues, was tested for covid-19 on 3/16. We got the results on 3/28 from the ER saying they were positive. He called his PCP on Monday requesting a doctors note from work as they were requesting one. His doctor got the results back from the ER and they say inconclusive, not positive. So now his PCP is wanting to release him back to work tomorrow? Even though he is still VERY short of breath, running a low grade fever, coughing, and incredibly exhausted. He’s an “essential employee” (works at a car dealership so that’s apparently essential 🙄). His doctors office doesn’t want him to come in, but wants him to go back to work because he has no diagnosis. 


Oh but they think it’s somehow sinusitis because he has a history of that? Um. What? Since when does sinusitis cause you to be unable to catch your breath?! But then they go on to say lots of false negatives out there and that he should go back to the ER. I think the fuck not. Every single ER would be PISSED he came in because he is NOT in an emergent need. He’s ok. He’s just not ok to go back to work and if he has covid-19, then he is VERY much so contagious.

fsk13y,My doctor called me to visit office in person to discuss test results. How concerned should I be?,"Hi, I'm 27F, white, 5'7"" and 220 lb. I have officially diagnosed ADHD and fibromyalgia, for which I take 50 mg Vyvanse and 90 mg Cymbalta. I also take OTC Claritin every day and OTC Benadryl every night for allergies, as well as 400 mg magnesium supplement to prevent migraines (all recommended by my doctor).

So in late February before things with COVID kicked off in my area, I had a physical with a new GP. My main concern has been whether I'm having allergy or asthma problems, because I've been noticing some shortness of breath and what I could only describe as deep, down-to-the-bone itchiness, particularly after exertion outside or at night. My doctor ordered some metabolic and lipid panels, CBCs, and a few other blood tests related to allergy concerns.

I assumed with everything going on that at most, my doctor would call me if something was abnormal. I'm in California under a shelter-in-place order and the recommendation is to have non-urgent medical visits over the phone whenever possible, which makes sense.

However, I got a call from her office yesterday that she wants me to come in person to discuss the test results. The phone call was with the receptionist, so all she could confirm when I asked was that the doctor definitely wanted to have the conversation in person. I have an appointment next week, so I assume it's nothing that'll kill me, but the fact she wants me there in person rather than making a telephone appointment is making me nervous. 

Med professionals of Reddit: I'm not looking for an exact diagnosis here, but what kind of discussion should I prepare for with these results?

**Abnormal test results**

Cholesterol, total = 225 (ref &lt;200 mg/dL)

LDL cholesterol = 139 (ref &lt;100 mg/dL)

Non HDL cholesterol = 167 (ref &lt;130 mg/dL)

Red blood cell count = 5.44 (ref 3.80-5.10 million/uL)

MCV = 79.6 (ref 80.0-100.0 fL)

MCH = 25.7 (ref 27.0-33.0 pg)

**Borderline or maybe-relevant test results (to my eye anyway)**

HDL cholesterol = 58 (ref &gt;= 50 mg/dL)

Triglycerides = 146 (ref &lt; 150 mg/dL)

Hematocrit = 43.3 (ref 35.0-45.0%)

MCHC = 32.3 (ref 32.0-36.0 g/dL)

Bilirubin, total = 0.3 (ref 0.2-1.2 mg/dL)

Sodium = 138 (ref 135-146 mmol/L)

Sed rate by modified westergren = 17 (&lt;= 20 mm/h)

I'm not sure if the test results solidly in normal range would be relevant to this, but I can provide if they are.

A couple other pieces of relevant background: first, I knew and I told my doctor right off the bat that my cholesterol has been very high since I was literally 12 years old, when my BMI was actually in what was considered a ""healthy"" range and I was exercising regularly; no matter what my diet or weight has looked it, it has always been the same level as above, plus or minus 5 units. She told me that it's likely genetic, since it's pretty uncommon for a preteen to have levels like that.

Also, regarding my weight: yes, I'm aware that I'm fat. Without getting into detail, the combination of fatigue and joint pain from fibromyalgia combined with a highly stressful couple of years resulted in weight gain. I've lost about 35 lbs over the past 9 months to put me at my current total, but it's plateaued. What I had to do to get lower than 215 had numerous health complications themselves and was not maintainable. The best health and happiness results for me have come from changing to a pescatarian diet, focusing on getting the nutrition that I need, cutting way back on the emotional eating, speed-walking and yoga daily, and most importantly *not focusing on the precise number on a scale*. I am aware of and have experience with the concepts of calorie counting, macro counting, intermittent fasting, paleo, keto, and the million different apps to track all of these things. My fasting glucose and A1C are currently well within healthy range, but I'm keeping a close eye on it since I have a family history of type 2 diabetes.",2,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/fsk13y/my_doctor_called_me_to_visit_office_in_person_to/"")",2020-03-31 12:58:40,Physician Responded
fsk3ju,[35M] Long recovery from Flu B? (Asthmatic)," I have asthma (controlled with very rare rescue inhaler usage... as in less than 2-3 times/month).

About 3 weeks ago I was diagnosed with Flu B in the hospital. I did a few nebs, but my chest still felt really tight and I had a nasty wheeze. A few weeks later, after using the nebulizer at home and regular inhaler (albuterol), I no longer have a wheeze. I have no cough. I have no fever.

Nevertheless, the chest tightness and back pain, while more mild than before, have persisted. I am still, in fact, feeling quite reliant on my inhaler too. Some days are better than others, but overall my breathing is not where it was prior to Flu B. When I exhale, I can feel some strain that makes my breath feel 'shaky' as it comes out. Again, no wheeze, just strain and shakiness. My pulse ox is always 97 and above.

Is this some sort of post viral inflammation that's messing with my lungs as an asthmatic or should I be more concerned there's something else going on? I have heard it mentioned that sometimes a nasty flu can take weeks to resolve (but how many weeks?)

fskyq9,"[Case Study] Case Study for a Class, any help would be appreciated."," M.B., a 55 year old right-handed woman, was referred to the clinic by a social worker at the assisted care centre where Ms. M.B. is currently living. The social worker and other members of the medical team expressed concerns about possible onset of psychotic episodes. She reported that M.B. had become somewhat non-communicative, but when engaged, she related increasingly improbable anecdotes about her earlier life as a concert pianist. While the content of these stories was somewhat impoverished, the details she was able to convey included stories of concert tours with several well-known orchestras. Ms. M.B. was accompanied to the appointment by a personal care worker. She was appropriately groomed although she appeared somewhat disheveled. Her care worker indicated that she has to be reminded daily to maintain her personal hygiene. She was cooperative and pleasant when directly engaged, however, she was quiet and did not spontaneously engage in conversations. She appeared generally unconcerned about the reasons for the clinical referral. M.B. has been living in the assisted living facility for about 6 months and has been estranged from her family for the last several years. According to the care worker, Ms. M.B. does have two close female friends who visit regularly. While the details are unclear, it appears that her position as a concert pianist ended about a decade ago for reasons related to her unreliability, and inconsistency in her performances. Her employment records since that time have been spotty. Recent medical history was positive for pneumonia and there was a brief note in the medical record suggesting that malnutrition was suspected at one point, prompting action to have her admitted to the assisted living facility. Hospital records revealed that she was admitted to the emergency department approximately 1 month ago, following a visit with one of her friends. She was found lying on the floor of her room incoherent and disoriented, and there was suspicion of alcohol toxicity. Examination in the E.R. revealed abnormal eye movements. She was released from the emergency within 24 hours and returned to the assisted living facility. Medical history since that time was unremarkable. Upon examination, overall intellectual functioning was revealed to be in the high average range. Vocabulary and spatial reasoning were both high average. Other tests of verbal ability, for example naming objects appeared to be normal. On a brief measure to assess overall cognitive status (mini-mental status exam) M.B. was unable to recall any of three words presented five minutes earlier, although she gave a long list of incorrect words, stating with considerable conviction that she recalled hearing them. Subsequent testing revealed that M.B. had significant difficulty recalling a more extensive (16 word) list after a 20-minute delay. Indeed, when questioned she did not recall being presented with a word list. Again, she had numerous intrusions (stating words that were not on the original list). However, she performed above chance on a forced choice word list. On a word stem completion test, M.B. selected a disproportionate number of previously studies target words even though she did not recall studying the word list. When testing her spatial memory, her ability to reproduce a 2-dimensional spatially figure from memory after a 30-minute delay was severely impoverished. As with the word list, she did not recall studying the figure. On a test, of executive function and processing speed (Trails A &amp; B), M.B. had difficulty switching categories from letter to numbers, however, her performance was most notable for her severely slow response times. On another measure of processing and motor speed, the Finger Tapping Test, her performance was in the impaired range for both hands. Neuroimaging revealed global cortical atrophy with a notation of abnormal, although unspecified, appearance of the diencephalic structures. Despite a general absence of spontaneous speech, it is notable that at the end of the testing session M.B. became animated while relating a story from her former career as a pianist where she performed with Leonard Bernstein at Carnegie Hall. On follow-up she indicated that she had played in many of the world’s greatest concert halls and is frequently invited back for performances even to this day.

Hi Docs,

There have been many articles that link lisinopril to increase risk of contracting coronavirus and having complications as a result of the disease. My BP readings were at 140-90 about a year ago so I started to take the medication to control it. In that time I’ve gone from about 180 pounds at diagnosis to 200 pounds back down to 190 and still losing weight. The only explanation for the high readings is genetics and my weight. To reduce my blood pressure I am dieting moderately. I’ve cut down caffeine dramatically to about 2 cups of coffee a day to maybe 2 cups a week with no other caffeine intake. I’m doing 3 hour walks/runs about 5 days a week with some light lifting with dumbbells  that I have in my house and other fitness activities I can do inside. My BP readings on the medication are consistently 125-130/75-85 range, with a few high outliers that are probably due to some stress in these times. I am considering calling my doctor to see if I should stop taking it for a few months because the medication I’m on puts me in risk of getting COVID-19.

fsn2kz,Brain damage regarding Cannabis abuse,"I decided to quit smoking pot for a number of reasons. I'm going back to school, want to lose weight, and (might be bro-science) I don't want to weaken my lungs with COVID-19 being everywhere.

Ironically enough, my concentration has gotten slightly worse since I've stopped. It's been about 5 weeks and I have trouble reading novels at night(for some reason, I can read on reddit for hours). I'll lose my concentration several times and it will take me about 30 mins to read 4-5 pages of a regular nonfiction book (12 rules for life - Jordan Peterson).

I'm guessing this is due to a number of things but can't help but think it's mainly due to the withdrawals. I've been a casual smoker (cycles of smoking a joint every couple days to 3 joints per day) for about 8 years. I'm 29 and starting college again in the summer to finish my degree and am concerned that if my concentration doesn't get better in the next month I may not be ready to take summer classes.

On a side note, I've been taking medication for ADHD and depression for about a year now (Bupropion 150mg). And I drink about 3-4 shots of espresso throughout the day. And I'll usually try reading after a long day of work (new job).

fsns2n,"Nausea, bloating, reactions to foods ruining my life. Gastroenterologist says he doesn't know why.","Summary:

* Nausea while eating/after eating for several hours
* Bloated/fullness/tight stomach feeling after eating
* Wake up at night seemingly at random with increasing waves of nausea and anxiety attacks
* Eating too much causes similar nausea and anxiety attacks
* Same bloated feeling after drinking even moderate amounts of water
* Have had episodes of acid reflux
* Weight loss - lost 10kg in about 1.5 months
* Endoscopy with biopsy showed no H. Pylori, mild gastritis, no conditions of oesophagus or duodenum
* No gallstones present
* Small abnormality in liver - likely a hemangioma
* Bloodwork comes back normal apart from Vit D deficiency which I'm taking supplements for.

A little history: For about 4 years I've had occasional bouts of waking up at night with nausea that comes in waves, increasing and usually culminating with me feeling like I'll throw up but never getting to the point of retching or vomiting. This is accompanied by a panic attack of sorts, elevated heartrate and sweating. I have some form of emetophobia which does not help. This was occurring maybe every 3 months or so for a few years. Last year it started to happen more often, at first every couple months, then every month, punctuated with a few episodes of it occurring several nights in a week. I never had any such symptoms during the day.

In early December last year I remember being in the car driving to a restaurant for lunch with my partner and feeling this strange nauseated feeling that concerned me. In the month that followed, I began waking up at night often with the same nausea attacks in addition to nausea during the day, usually while eating or after meals but sometimes also on an empty stomach. This culminated in a 3 day/night stretch of nausea nearly all day and being up with horrible nausea every night while away camping over new years. That prompted me to see a doctor, who diagnosed me with GERD/GORD and put me on a PPI. 

Initially this seemed to help my night time nausea attacks greatly as I had about a week of good sleep. Then I changed my dose from 2x a day to 1x a day as instructed after a week and it all came back. I went back to the doctor who told me to increase the dose, but my day and night symptoms continued. Around this time I had an ultrasound which showed **no gallstones but some abnormality in my liver (for which I've yet to be scanned, but doctors said it's likely a hemangioma).** 

After about a month, I made an appointment with a gastroenterologist who scheduled me in for an endoscopy. **The scope showed mild gastritis but no conditions of the oesophagus or duodenum.** By this point I had found a few foods which seemed to upset me less (but not completely negate my symptoms) and the advice I was given was essentially 'keep eating those things and I'll see you in a month'. I saw some improvement by sticking to the few things I could eat, mostly rice with chicken, cereals with almond milk, sushi. But never an elimination of symptoms (apart from a few glorious days here and there). The gastroenterologist says that the degree of inflammation in my stomach should not cause the symptoms I'm experiencing.

He was able to answer my questions immediately and has decent grip strength in both his hands, and able to move his toes (and feel them). I helped him to his feet and got him into a chair, and he was able to participate in a meaningful manner in a conversation between himself, his wife and I for the next 45 minutes (5-50 min post fall).

He has a slight abbrasion on the back of his head, but the bleeding stopped within \~20 min.

 So far he has taken a 400mg Ibuprofen for the swelling (at my direction - Not a doctor but not completely ignorant of physiology, have a biochem degree, my bad if thats a no-no on this sub this is my first time posting)

I am worried that he may suffer some intracranial swelling as he has a fairly large bump on the back of his head. As of 15 min ago, the bump is fairly large, but is visibly not filling with blood, and is slightly pink. It is roughly 5cm horizontal X 8cm vertical ( 2 in h x 3 in v) and protruding ~0.5-0.75cm (0.2 - 0.37 inches) from the rest of his scalp on the most posterior part of the right side of his skull.

**due to the ongoing covid19 situation, his wife would rather avoid having paramedics come to the house to take him to the emergency dept. In my province (ontario, Canada) there is a nurse hotline where we can ask for advice, but it is overloaded with covid19 callers at the moment**

**1) Should this get checked out regardless? As far as we can tell he does not appear concussed**

**2) what symptoms should we look out for in the next couple of hours to make sure his condition is not going to deteriorate further overnight?** 

SO FAR: I have recommended that:
- he sleep with his head as elevated as possible
-his wife stay in contact/interact with him to make sure his mental state is not getting worse
-they apply ice to the affected area (15 min ON, 30-45 min OFF) 

As I said earlier, I am not completely ignorant of mammalian physiology, feel free to use your big words, I would just like some advice as to how to proceed and what to watch for. 

Also feel free to chastise me, I give zero fucks how wrong I am, unimportant at the moment.

I recently had a BM with a concerning amount of blood (water in the bowl turned red). I went to my general pediatrician who ran many tests, including extensive bloodwork, inspection, and sample. I have a family history of polyps and irritable bowels. None of the tests came back with anything conclusive except confirmation that there had been blood in my stool. My doctor recommended I start taking Miralax daily to aid with my stool texture. I take half a capsule/adult dosage a day and it truly has done wonders for me. I did gain about 8 lbs, but this was welcome as I was underweight before. I'm not sure if this is a side effect of the Miralax because I also had a broken wrist at the time which significantly reduced my activity. However, when I forget a dose I do notice a slight drop in my weight.

I followed up with a GI specialist who concluded that the blood was likely due to a tear during a particularly hard BM. The GI also recommended continued use of Miralax.

However, I have not had a period since before I started the medication. I am typically very regular and have never had a skipped period. Very rarely does my period come more than a few days late. My average cycle is about 33 days with a 4 day period. I have not had a period in 56 days, and my ovulation occurred when I would normally have expected it to. I have not noticed a second ovulation, but I have had my typical pre-period/ovulating symptoms of cramping and back pain every now and again. There is no possibility of pregnancy. Is it possible that Miralax can cause irregular/skipped periods or hormone changes? Is this something I should be concerned about?",1,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/fsobbo/can_miralax_cause_hormone_changes/"")",2020-03-31 16:51:09,Physician Responded

A year ago this happened and I felt that something in my throat then overtime it felt like it was getting bigger to the level that eventually I couldn’t breathe from my mouth.

So my mom has a macular hole in her left eye, and it renders her half blond usually in the real sense. According to her, she can (or now could) see perfectly out of her right eye, but can't see well out of her left eye. It got worse last week when her eyesight was blocked by blood. 

Yesterday (Friday) she went into her usual doctor for a laser treatment to stop or slow the bleeding in the left eye. Today she woke up crying because she can't see well in neither eyes. 
Idk if it's important to mention, but she did this procedure last year before.

My question is, what could have went wrong with the procedure that would mess up the eye that wasn't touched?
Is this just a part of the healing process? Is this (somewhat) normal? 

One thing that she mentioned that she did differently than last time was that she didn't allow them to put the numbing agent (?) in her eyes. Could that have affected the results?

I told her to calm down and wait until Monday (because she can't do much now that it's Saturday), but she's still so worried and afraid that now she's fully blind. 

I personally feel like maybe it's too early to tell reckoning that she did it just yesterday. But may this wasn't supposed to happen.

If anyone has dealt with this before in their patients, have they healed? Even if it was only just a little. If anything, I want to give her some assurance, and if this situation that I described sounds bad to y'all I'll like to give her some advice.

I have never had sex, and I am unable to have sex because of my fear of pregnancy.
Ever since I was 16 I have been terrified of pregnancy. It's one of, if not my biggest fears. I absolutely 100% do not want children. I know that something like the implant and condoms are very good at preventing pregnancy, but even then I read about how people have been using BC and condoms and STILL got pregnant. I know that abortion is an option, but that also terrifies me. If I got pregnant, and were unable to abort, I would kill myself. No joke. I know that getting your tubes cut/tied is also an option, but even that carries the risk of pregnancy. I lay awake at night absolutely terrified of the idea of pregnancy. I would love to be sexually active, but i just can't. 
I also plan to go on testosterone in the future, but NHS waiting lists are 3 years long, even longer considering the current climate. Once I'm on testosterone, after a good few years I'll likely need a hysterectomy anyway. But this is ages away.
I also have really, really heavy periods. I use incontinence pads to absorb it all and it causes me to feel the effects of blood loss from time to time. 
The only way I'd feel safe enough to have sex and stop fretting all night(and also be able to stop wearing incontinence pads) is if I were to have a hysterectomy. I'll need one later in life anyway, so, given the circumstances, how likely is it that my GP would let me get a hysterectomy? I honestly really, really need one. It would not only help me get over my pregnancy fears but also alleviate some gender dysphoria and stop these god awful periods. I know I'm only 19 and haven't used any other method of contraception, but I just can't have sex until I'm certain I'll never ever get pregnant. I know it's a major procedure, but I really feel like I need it.

fuzo5o,Intermittent fever for over a month. I’m scared.,"Me: 26, female, 96lbs, 5’3”

Diagnoses: LQTS, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, anxiety, depression, OCD

Medication: buspirone, metoprolol

Duration: A little over a month.


I should start by saying my normal body temperature is around 97.6F. In late February, I started developing low-grade fevers each evening (around 99.2F). On February 26, I went to my PCP as I had a very slight cough (pretty much just clearing my throat) and some green mucus in my nose. She told me it sounded like I was getting over an upper respiratory infection. My appointment was at 11:30am, and my temp was 98.8F. 

The next day on February 27, I went to the ER for a bad panic attack (heart rate of 175, high BP). I was admitted at 9am, and my temp was 98.3F at that time. They gave me fluids and some Ativan to calm me down, and my vitals returned to normal. All of my tests came back normal, including CBC, metabolic panel, x-ray, and EKG. *My WBC was 6.5.* 

On March 2 I followed up with my PCP. Concerned about my low-grade fever, she ordered a urinalysis to rule out a UTI even though I didn’t exhibit any symptoms. The urinalysis showed “trace leukocyte esterase,” but it came back with a negative urine culture (no significant growth after 16 hours). 

On March 6 I returned to my PCP’s office, but saw a different doctor. At this point my temp is still going up to 99.4-99.6F every evening. They ran another CBC, and everything was still within normal limits, but my *WBC was 8.7.* 

At this point my temp would return to normal (97.2-97.6F) when I’d wake up and check it at night.

Now it’s April 4 and my intermittent fever still hasn’t gone away. For the past few days, it’s getting as high as 99.7-99.9F each evening. At night when I wake up and check it, it’s at 98.1-98.3F. 

The only other symptom I had in March was some diarrhea, but I attributed that to stress and not eating well (I lose my appetite when I’m anxious). 

TLDR: I’m really at my wit’s end. My temperature goes up to around 99.9F each evening, but returns to a relatively normal temp when I’m sleeping. I hadn’t tried to lower the fever until yesterday evening when I took one dose of Tylenol. I’m terrified I have an undiagnosed infection like endocarditis, or I’ve developed sepsis. I have an appointment with my PCP on Monday but I’m scared that’s too far away.

I cant stop pee mid peeing. pee comes out throughout the day so i always have to wear a pad, especially when going out. I cant have sex since i have extreme laxity in my vagina.

I can at any time when im not even aroused insert 3-4 fingers without much resistance. i cant feel my muscles very well, and i cant grip my fingers while squeezing almost no matter how many fingers i use. it feels like there is literally no tissue left to be stretched.

From all I have heard, this is unlikely, but being an asthmatic, therefore higher risk individual, I figured I'd ask just to be extra safe before telling him yes/no.

fv2x7q,Hematologists please?,"23f, 5’1, about 115lbs. Somewhat active, ex- light smoker. Occasional drink. Unsure of any medical diagnosis.

Any hematologists here?

I've always had shockingly vivid red blood, and I don't know how blood is supposed to flow, but I feel like mine compares to water.
At my past job, we got our blood drawn annually. Here, I discovered that I have a high platelet count, as well as a high RBC. Conversely, I have low hemoglobin. That explains the visuals.

But these three things together... what could they suggest? Are they to be concerned about? Are they normal? Should I look into anemia, or something more serious?

I haven't been able to take it up with a doctor, as specialists are expensive... but I figure if I can gauge the significance of these things, I may bite the bullet and go.

Hello Reddit Doctors,

I have had a small white lump on my outer ear for nearly 2 years. I havn't thought much of it until the past month or so. I've noticed it seems to have grown in size and I now have another smaller bump right next to it.

I am worried this might be some form of ear cancer, should I see my doctor or is this likely just a cyst? I've been hesitent to see a doctor recently due to COVID-19 .

fv3d0y,Is this red spot on my leg a cause for concern? (22/F),"Hello, I am a 22 year old female, living in Florida, with no known medical conditions other than anxiety. No drugs, smoking, alcohol, etc. Around 5'5"" and 115 or so lbs. Not on any medications.

I've had this red spot on my leg for at least a few weeks now. Here are some photos: [https://imgur.com/a/oOuBTF9](https://imgur.com/a/oOuBTF9)

The first photo is from a few weeks ago. The last two are from today. It hasn't changed much other than maybe becoming more rounded and it feels a little dryer to the touch. It doesn't hurt or itch, though if i touch it it may itch very mildly, I'm not convinced it's not my brain playing tricks on me. If I press on it with my finger, the color lightens, then when I release it goes back to this color. It is flat and not raised. I haven't done much to it other than moisturizing with my regular body lotion.

Is this something to be worried about? Normally I would ignore it, but the fact that it hasn't gone away or improved is worrying me. I can be prone to redness, acne, and dry skin, but I've never had a persistent, almost perfectly round spot before. Clearly it isn't a bruise, and it's not sunburn since I haven't spent much time outside in weeks.

fvgbwe,Severe abdominal pain for months. DESPERATE FOR ANSWERS,"19M, 5'6"", 205 lbs

I've been dealing with severe abdominal pain since November. It is constant, 24/7 pain. Other symptoms are alternating diarrhea and constipation, loss of appetite (leading to weight loss), nausea, vomiting (rare). After several doctor visits, I was finally diagnosed with IBS when I went to the ER like a month or so ago. Then a week later I saw a GI specialist who wasn't convinced it was IBS and was looking more towards gallbladder and Crohn's. He set up several tests, ultrasound, upper GI, colonoscopy. All of them were cancelled because of Covid. He told me to go to the ER if I had to. Which I did. And they refused to treat me. They refilled my meds and did absolutely nothing else because this isn't a life or death situation. I called a different hospital before I went in and they told me the same thing. They won't test me or do anything for me. 

I've been on a few different meds, none have worked. Including prescription and over the counter. Before, when I was actually able to see a doctor, I was told to change my diet. I've switched completely to soy milk, that seems to work. I've cut out most greasy foods. When I do eat something greasy, it will make it worse if I eat a lot of it. Pop makes it worse. My diet has mainly consisted of a lot of fish, turkey, and chicken, plus soy milk, juices and teas. None of these make it worse but it's definitely not making it better. I'm desperate for any kind of help. I still am supposed to work, because I'm considered ""essential"" but I haven't been able to work much, so I'm gonna end up losing my job anyways. I can barely sleep because the pain is too much.

* I've had GERD / stomach acidity for nearly 10 years now. I have quit caffeine and cut down on junk food to battle this.
* I also have anxiety, especially medical anxiety. I always feel like something is wrong with me.

Last week I had a full-blown panic attack because I felt like I was going to pass out. I got a dizzy and lightheaded feeling and quickly had to eat something, and only then I felt better.

Diabetes does run in the family, but I try to workout and eat healthy and my a1c is always below 5.7 . So what gives?

fvgsuj,Dangers of anal sex?,"For reference I’m a 24 year old male just wanting more insight on this topic. I wouldn’t want to cause any irreparable harm to a girlfriend.

So I ran into this post on r/FemaleDatingStrategy a while back but for some reason I’m not able to crosspost it here. I’m just wondering how medically accurate this post is and what things might have been left out. The OP seems rather biased.

“I’m a retired registered nurse. I worked in ICU/trauma in a major metropolitan Level I facility for over a decade. Let me be clear: anal sex is high-risk sexual behavior for a reason. It invariably causes physiological damage, particularly when practiced repeatedly over time. Back in the day my fellow LGB friends/allies were often angry if we asked about their sexual practices, particularly anal sex. In this case it’s not homophobic, although there is certainly room to discuss the real homophobias that do exist in the health delivery system. Rather, we asked because anal sex is very high risk and the lower GI tract was not designed for sexual penetration.

Anal sex causes fissures and other small wounds because there is no lubrication in the rectum. It’s designed to expel feces and not for fucking. It will damage rectal sphincter tone, which eventually leads to fecal incontinence, stress leakage, and urinary tract infections from E. coli (because the shit leaking out of your ass will migrate into your vagina and urethra). Chronic inflammation and injury can lead to internal and external bleeding hemorrhoids, rectal prolapse (collapse and protrusion of the rectum externally through the anus) and rectocele (the collapse of the rectum into the vagina). The retrograde exposure to previously expelled feces and urine, along with any lovely bacteria Pornsick Paul is toting in his urethral meatus, can lead to serious systemic bacterial infection. Continued damage to the mucosal structure of the most distal GI tract (this occurs because these structures are not designed to be penetrated and don’t produce lubrication like a vagina does) can create fistulas, which is an opening that erodes between two organs or sterile spaces in the body. In this case, it means feces will leak from the lower intestine into, say, the vagina.

All of these issues are very serious; some are life-threatening. Many require surgery, and longterm antibiotics, and pain, and permanent impact on sexual function. I have personally seen it in my clinical practice and it is heartbreaking. I love a gentle finger in my ass on a wild Saturday night but that is a hard limit, and even that’s not very often.

Ladies please DO NOT mutilate your bodies for these pornsick pieces of shit. They won’t even remember what you look like in 10 years but you could end up shitting in a bag for the rest of your life.

Love and power to you all. Except the LVM reading this shit and jerking off to the thought of women suffering for your amusement. Fuck you. We’re onto you and we’ve figured out that you know it hurts us: that’s exactly why you like it. And that’s why you won’t ever get it until you’ve given it up to my 8-inch strap on a few times first.

fvj16w,Can Straterra (atomoxetine) be used for depression?,"31 year old white male, with GAD, dysthymia, and moderate to severe IBS.  (all diagnosed by the appropriate specialists).  Non smoker, non drinker.

I understand that this is primarily used for ADHD (which I don't have), but has anyone had success using this NRI medication for treatment of depression in their patients?  Does it increase energy and motivation at all?

The reason I ask is that Wellbutrin is the only antidepressant I've tried that makes me feel better (I've tried multiple SSRI's, and ""atypical"" antidepressants like Trintellix and Remeron). But I had to quit the Wellbutrin due to uncomfortable heart fluttering sensations, and this was on the lowest dose of the XR version (150 mg )

Wellbutrin was also  the only medication to SIGNIFICANTLY improve my IBS symptoms, which in turn had an even more positive reinforcement on my depression and feelings of well-being.   SSRI's only aggravate all of this. 

It should be noted that caffeine significantly improves my depression too, but stops working after a tolerance has been built up. This is why my doctor tried Wellbutrin on me.

&amp;#x200B;

Are these two medications (strattera and wellbutrin) in the same class because they have noradrenergic activity?   Is this mechanism also what helps alleviate chronic pain, such as the type found in IBS?   I'm just trying to gather some information that I can take to my next doctor's appointment.

fvjq88,[UPDATE] Intermittent fever for over a month. I’m scared.,"UPDATE: I tested positive for COVID-19 this morning. My boyfriend and I haven’t left my apartment in 23 days, so we’re not sure if he was an asymptomatic carrier or if I got this from a grocery delivery (we clean all of our groceries btw).  

&gt;Me: 26, female, 96lbs, 5’3”

Diagnoses: LQTS, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, anxiety, depression, OCD

Medication: buspirone, metoprolol

Duration: A little over a month.


I should start by saying my normal body temperature is around 97.6F. In late February, I started developing low-grade fevers each evening (around 99.2F). On February 26, I went to my PCP as I had a very slight cough (pretty much just clearing my throat) and some green mucus in my nose. She told me it sounded like I was getting over an upper respiratory infection. My appointment was at 11:30am, and my temp was 98.8F. 

The next day on February 27, I went to the ER for a bad panic attack (heart rate of 175, high BP). I was admitted at 9am, and my temp was 98.3F at that time. They gave me fluids and some Ativan to calm me down, and my vitals returned to normal. All of my tests came back normal, including CBC, metabolic panel, x-ray, and EKG. *My WBC was 6.5.* 

On March 2 I followed up with my PCP. Concerned about my low-grade fever, she ordered a urinalysis to rule out a UTI even though I didn’t exhibit any symptoms. The urinalysis showed “trace leukocyte esterase,” but it came back with a negative urine culture (no significant growth after 16 hours). 

On March 6 I returned to my PCP’s office, but saw a different doctor. At this point my temp is still going up to 99.4-99.6F every evening. They ran another CBC, and everything was still within normal limits, but my *WBC was 8.7.* 

At this point my temp would return to normal (97.2-97.6F) when I’d wake up and check it at night.

Now it’s April 4 and my intermittent fever still hasn’t gone away. For the past few days, it’s getting as high as 99.7-99.9F each evening. At night when I wake up and check it, it’s at 98.1-98.3F. 

The only other symptom I had in March was some diarrhea, but I attributed that to stress and not eating well (I lose my appetite when I’m anxious). 

TLDR: I’m really at my wit’s end. My temperature goes up to around 99.9F each evening, but returns to a relatively normal temp when I’m sleeping. I hadn’t tried to lower the fever until yesterday evening when I took one dose of Tylenol. I’m terrified I have an undiagnosed infection like endocarditis, or I’ve developed sepsis. I have an appointment with my PCP on Monday but I’m scared that’s too far away.

fvjraq,Is a pinched nerve in my neck serious enough to go to the doctor right now?,"Hello,

I hope everyone is doing well out there. I’m a 26 year old white  male, 5’9” 180 lbs. 

I’ve  been in self isolation with my partner for about 3 plus weeks now. We live in Los Angeles and have been doing alright with the isolation but I’ve noticed that I seem to have pinched a nerve in my neck. I’m not a doctor or a medical professional so I could be wrong but I know people who have a pinched nerve and the symptoms are very similar. I have a very tight neck (for about two days) which radiates pain into my head which has been causing headaches, nausea and a general feeling of weakness. I think it’s because my studio is small so we mostly lay in bed all day (I know, not the healthiest, we just don’t have like a couch so we mostly watch things or play games in bed).

But my main question is: is this really serious enough to warrant a doctors visit right now? I’m trying to be extra cautious because I know the medical system is under a lot of strain right now.

However, his chest x-rays don’t look great.. I work with a pulmonologist who has been looking at his xrays daily and he believed his xray looked better today. But the radiologist commented that he has “patchy airspace opacities” and yesterday’s report said he had “dense bilateral opacities”..

From a DR POV, is patchy airspace opacities better than the dense ones? It says his left upper lobe on the report has increased in the left upper lobe compared to the prior  and I know that’s not great.

fvnoav,11 month fell from 80cm height onto back.,"Hi all,

I'm a half-brother of an 11 month (almost 1 year) old. This morning he was standing up in his bed, holding onto the railing, and flipped forward. He fell about 80cm, onto his back (full frontal flip.) My mom is worried sick, has been watching and stressing all day. She says he's been normal, no changes in behaviour or eating, sleeping, etc. but she's still really worried. He did cry when he fell, but stopped shortly after we rushed to help him. 

Could there be damage we haven't noticed or seen? What's the best course of action? ER is not a place we want to go right now and given how he's acting normal, we'd end up waiting +1 days to even get seen (we're in Canada.) 

An appointment with his pediatrician has been made for tomorrow, but she doesn't fully trust that they're going to perform all the necessary tests to determine if everything is fine.

What sort of tests should we push for? What should we be on the lookout for? Anything we should know or anticipate?

Any advice at all would be appreciated.","26F, 165cm, 59kg. Caucasian. No medication, no alcohol. Smoke about 10 cigarettes a day.

This all started 4 months ago when I discovered a sudden big lump in my groin. I'll try to keep it brief: it was thought to be an inguinal hernia, echo was made, turned out to be a rather big lymph node instead. New symptoms appeared about a week or two after the lump: fatigue, loss of appetite paired with occasional nausea. About a month after the node appeared I got referred to an internist: blood test done, nothing unusual except for my white blood cell count which was high. MRI and another echo, showed nothing unusual except for said lymph node + a skinny aorta. Got sent back to my GP, another blood test done, white blood cell count about 10% up from last time. GP said my blood doesn't show any signs of infections so that's not why the cell count is so high. Tested for a multitude of viruses, epstein-barr among them, all negative. GP now at a loss as well, decided to wait a few weeks to do another blood test to see if the white cell counts went up. This was supposed to happen a couple of weeks ago but was postponed due to the current situation.

So now, almost four months after the lymph node appeared my symptoms remain unchanged other than the fatigue which got worse, and today I discovered a [darker patch of skin on my pubic mound.](https://i.imgur.com/xTbud6y.jpg) As you can see on the photo most of the pubic hair on that part of the skin fell out. This happened suddenly, I didn't have this spot this morning. It's not a bruise.

It's on the same side as the swollen lymph node so that made me believe it could be related.

[Pictures of the issue are located here.](https://imgur.com/a/nbz7nsH). Note that my toes and feet aren't really as purple/blue as the pictures suggest, it's just the lighting of when I took them.

I've been having a strange and annoying itchy toe problem. Last fall, while laying in bed at night, I had it once or twice - on my 2nd and 3rd toe on my left foot. It was a weird burning/itching sensation on 2nd toe that eventually went away after an hour or so. I scratched it a bit, rubbed my toes a bit, got annoyed that it took 20 minutes to go away, then forgot about it. 

In the upcoming months, it happened once or twice at work as well - I'd be doing my desk job, and suddenly my toe would start to itch like a madman. I'd take off my shoe and sock and rub it brisky (not scratching it with my nail) and it was instant relief. Then I'd get busy at work and more or less forget about it, and it would have ""gone away"". You can see from the picture however that I have these two red ""dots"" on my 2nd toe which have been there the longest, several months at least, and have never really gone away.

However it's gotten worse during the shelter in place order in California. It's now a continual all day thing. Doesn't matter if I wear socks or not, doesn't matter if my toes are warm or cold, doesn't matter if I wear shoes or not. There are spots on the top of my toes and the pads of my toes. My little toe on my left foot has a couple of small reddish itchy spots too. 

They don't ever not itch - they just seem to itch less if I break down and give them a vigorous rub with my fingers (not my nails!). The vigorous rub is the only thing that seems to make it itch less. It seems to be especially bad and annoying at night when I'm trying to sleep and my feet are under blankets. I have tried sleeping with and without socks in an effort to solve the problem.

The only time I seem to get relief is when I wake up in the morning and do not put socks on, so my toes are fairly cold in a 62 degree house. That lasts for a few hours until the house warms up.
What was for months, my left foot, and only two toes, has in the past 5 days now ""spread"" to my right foot. Again 2nd and 3rd toe. My left toes actually doesn't seem to itch as much as my right toes anymore. Note that the itching stems from the spots on my toes, not the whole toe. But as I walk the spots rub against the other toes and irritate the area and that inflames the rest of the toe.

No bleeding, no cuts, no pus, no leakage, no blisters, nothing like that. Just those red sore spots.

It's maddening. Unfortunately, because of the SIP, I'm at home mostly suffering from it instead of going to a doctor or a podiatrist. I just have no idea what it could be so looking for some advice on this subreddit.

I don't have any other marks or itchy spots anywhere else on my body. Wife or kids don't have them either so I highly doubt it's bugs of some sort. I've looked up chilblains and they kind of look like that but also not really, plus I'm not like in sub 50 degree weather nor am I outside doing anything in cold weather. I'm sitting at home at my desk, except when I'm on my stationary bike or taking a walk which I try to do every day. I don't have any underlying medical conditions. Never had any problems with my feet at all, ever, never athlete's foot, never bedbugs, nothing. Although the included pictures look a little bit rough and I blame that to the lighting - I generally think my feet are in pretty good shape - wasn't an athlete that tore them up, didn't walk around barefoot my whole life in cornfields, etc.

No change in detergeants, no change in bath/body soap, no new socks or shoes, no change in anything really.

The only thing that gives me an hours or so relief is if I rub the toes like crazy for the itch relief and then just don't touch them. Almost like it's a muscle ache and I'm rubbing away the pain. I just did that before typing this message and my toes are tingling a bit but otherwise feel normal. 

Here's what I've tried:

* Athletes Foot medication. There doesn't appear to be any athlete's foot symptoms other than the itching. No cracked skin, or scaling, or anything like that. I am never in a public gym or barefoot out in public so I don't know how I would have gotten athlete's foot, let alone AF that started in the Fall and only bothered me once or twice, just to start again months later.

Every anti-itch mediciation I can find including:

* Cerave with Pramoxine Hydrochloride
* Cortizone-10 with Hydrocortisone
* Neosporin
* CVS Itch Relief Cream with Diphenhydramine hydrochloride and zinc acetate
* Tinactin Spray
* Witchhazel
* A bunch of different dry skin creams
* Bandaids around the 4 toes (which actually seems to work to relieve the itching probably because it's keeping the spots from rubbing against the other toes and also seems to constrict the toe a bit). But that's 4 bandaids a day and I don't have an unlimited supply!

None of the above creams offer any sort of immediate nor long term relief. If anything they make the itching worse because I have to touch my toes to apply the creams.

Looking for any and all advice on what I can do to alleviate this.",1,13,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/fxho44/itchy_red_spots_on_toes_gotten_worse_since_wfh/"")",2020-04-08 16:48:18,Physician Responded
fxhx00,Low stakes question about finger nails.,"Maybe this is a weird one - certainly not something I’d ever think to schedule an appointment for, however...

For years now (decade +) every once in a while some of my fingernails will start to separate from my finger, at the tip. If you picture a French tip manicure, imagine the curve where the white tip meets the pink/flesh finger part. Now every once in a while that curve will straighten out, almost as if something has pushed underneath the nail tip and back towards the bed, separating the two. Or imagine if you were scraping junk out from under your fingernail but you pushed too far back. Except it’s doing it on its own. 

I can feel swelling of my fingertip under the nail, it hurts and is super sore and sensitive for a few days. I can feel my pulse in the millimeter of love/attached fingernail. Then it’s almost like a callous will form right under the nail. And a few days later it will be over until it happens again. 

Typically every handful months. Only happens to my thumbs and pointer fingers. There is no trauma to the nail that precedes it. It’s annoying, it hurts, it seems impossible to google. I’ve tried lotion, antibacterial cream, vitamins, etc. nothing stops it from happening or stops it once it’s happening. Any ideas?

fxi8rr,Really itchy rash that started around March 18th and hasn't gone away. Please help!!,"23 female, don't smoke but the person I'm staying with does. I also don't drink or have tattoos because of risk factors. I am 5""6 and 155 pounds and have been to the doctor several times last month and before the shut down because of allergies and odd rash issues although this one is a new brand of hell. I have lupus and take plaq to manage it for the past three years and just started taking zoloft for anxiety and depression last month with no major side effects. I also take antihistimines for allergies as well but they are not helping with this. Around March 18th or 19th I ended up with what looked like long scratches on my chest that were extremely itchy. Over time they got progressively bigger, worse, and inflamed and it made it impossible to work from home. Then I put an anti-fungal on and it cleared up almost completely after a few days putting that on. Now after a few days of relief it came back itchier than ever and is now manifesting more as a true rash with small red and hardish bumps and spreading. I can't be seen by a doctor because of covid but I need to figure out what to do because this is UNBEARABLE.

I have no idea how to post a picture of the rash on this post so, let me know in the comment if you want a picture of it and I can send it to you through a dm on here.

I’m in my third year of university and I was just in the process of being hired to an on campus job when shelter in place orders began to be issued. I have kept myself in my apartment and some days hardly leaving my own room. My reading comprehension seems to have decreased when it comes to coursework. For example: I have been working on simple online work training (ethics, use of university property etc) and I have to read everything over and over again until I finally understand what I am reading. I have missed a few online quizzes because I have not seen announcements about them and I’m just generally not on top of everything with the sudden switch to online classes.

fxwz3m,Skin suddenly peeling on hands? Photos included (Maybe NSFW),"**21M, Chinese-Canadian here.** 

**Primary complaint**: Two weeks ago or so ago I noticed that my hands would become more 'spongy' than normal after hand-washing/showering/normal ADLs that involve getting my hands wet. The palms of my hands began to itch and a few days later, the top layer of skin began to peel. It isn't painful at all, but the area of new skin underneath is more irritable if I itch it. Within the past two days, the peeling has become a bit more severe and sometimes skin will come off in 1-2cm pieces. It is only limited to the palms of my hands, especially in the spaces between my fingers.

**Photos**: (Maybe NSFW? Pretty gross though): [https://imgur.com/a/apPlqan](https://imgur.com/a/apPlqan) 

**Past medical history**: This issue has occurred and spontaneously resolved itself before as a child but it was never as severe as it is now. Also, I do have a bit of hyperhidrosis of the palms of both my hands and feet but I've had that forever and I don't think it is related to the peeling now. Otherwise, I'm relatively active and healthy, no other medical issues.

**Medications/drugs**: Not on any medications. I don't smoke, drink, or use any other recreational drugs.

I've been making sure to thoroughly dry my hands and apply a non-oily moisturizing after each time they get wet but it doesn't look like it's going away any time soon. Nothing has changed in my diet from before this issue. I have a theory that it's this hand soap that I got a month ago that I've been using more frequently due to being more diligent about hand-washing with all that's going on now, so I've stopped using it as of two days ago. Will update if that does anything.

I know not to just stop a course of antibiotics, however, I would just like some advice (doctors are closed for a long weekend).

Is this going to have an impact on whether the antibiotics work? 
I have done a Google search on using loperamide to help stop the severe stomach issues, but it strongly advises against it due to the risk of side effect caused by the two medications coming into contact, so is there anything else I can try to stop this? I cannot live with liquid diarrhea multiple times a day for the next 5 days. I suffer fairly badly with anxiety and diarrhea is a huge trigger for me. My doctor also told me to stop taking my citalopram until the course is finished as it can cause issues with my heart. I am worried this is going to have a negative effect on my mental health.

Hello, and first of all let me say sorry for any misspelled word or poor grammar, as I'm not a native speaker.  
Back in mid January i woke up to go to work, and immediately after getting up i got REALLY light-headed. Tried to reach for the bathroom but i only walked a short distance until i passed out.  
(I had no pain in my abdomen when i woke up, only felt like i was going to pass out).

Anyway, i wake up and my abdomen feels like it's on fire, with stabbing sensations. Almost couldn't respond to anything, tho i managed to call an ambulance with a lot of struggle.  
I spent 8 hours in the ER, with a few tests in between, but as i was aching so much and wouldn't stop moving it was hard to do such tests promptly (and i suppose they couldn't just put me to sleep without knowing what i had).

Finally they did an ultrasound that detected a hole in my small intestine (about 2cm wide) and i was rushed to surgery. I spent a week and a half in the hospital after that, no tests were done, only a blood test right before I was free to go home, with a prescription of Flagyl (Metronidazol) Omeprazol and amoxicillin (Portuguese medication, i have no idea if it's well translated). I also did a diet for 3 weeks where i could only eat non fatty meats, rice, barely seasoned stuff (basically avoid anything that stimulates the digestive system).  
My Doctor told me they couldn't find anything from surgery that would cause the rupture, and with the newest pandemic i had my exams canceled and postponed.  
The only thing i can remember eating that night was a big bucket of popcorn, really..

So i reach out to you guys here, hoping to get some peace of mind.. Since the cause of such problem wasn't found its always on the back of my mind that it could happen again, since i don't know what to avoid.. I've started to chew my food a lot better, and have a healthier diet overall, try not to stress too much about it because in the end I'm doing the best i can to avoid it.

Feel free to speculate, I'm not a hypochondriac nor will I try anything stupid unless my Doctor says it's for the best.

fzfcsi,Rectal Bleeding,"Hello all, finally turning here because I can’t get an appointment for the life of me. I’m a 23y/o Male, I have a opiate addiction (I realize this is probably the root of most of my health issues, please refrain from judgment/ telling me to quit, I’m supposed to be getting a bed at a rehab next week). My diet since I became dependent on opioids has been poor, seeing as I don’t eat much in the first place. 

I have been dealing with constipation for a few months now, I have lost a lot of weight from not eating/ addiction. Anyways although embarrassing to say, I have had to manually remove my bowel movements frequently recently (probably more than I actually have to due to anxiety), but today as I went to manually remove I had a sharp pain and when I went to wipe there was a lot of bright red blood. It is continuously bleeding (wiped completely away, slowly the wipes become more red) and I’m scared. 

The piece I did get out I pulled apart and there seems to be no blood in the actual stool, just covering it. I stopped though because I was scared if I completed the task I would tear something / cause more issues. I am uncomfortably holding it in and want to know if I should treat as an emergency. There is pain on the left side of anus, but I’m not positive of the source of bleeding. Thank you for taking the time to read, anything helps. 

P.s. I have had large hard stools and this one is no different. Any ideas on making these easier to pass.

fzfhj5,Low resting heart rate and on Sertraline? Underactive thyroid?,"I've had a FitBit for a couple of months now which consistently reads my resting heart rate to be about 56-57bpm. I've read that anything lower than 60bpm is too low. On top of this, I've been on Sertraline/Zoloft for just over a year (100mg a day since May) which has a side effect of raising your heart rate. Does this mean my natural resting heart rate is even lower?

Worried it might be an underactive thyroid. Not sure if just paranoid after looking it up but I do quite often feel dizzy/lightheaded if when I stand up after being sat down for a while.

Want to say up front, I am NOT anti-vaxx, quite the opposite actually, and I’m an RN. 

I started grad school for my DNP this past Fall 2019. My titers returned non-immune to both MMR and Hep B. I started the vaccine series and in November 2019, I went to my primary office for the second shot in the series for both MMR and Hep B. The MA gave both vaccines in my L deltoid. The first was completely normal. The second was extremely painful, and my muscle seized up during the injection. Following that, my muscle was twitching and seizing up for the next 24-36 hours. Now, 5 months later, I still have pretty significant pain in my deltoid. It affects my ROM and is overall just pretty uncomfortable. 

My question is....if I were to seek “treatment”, is there even a way for them to tell if my muscle was damaged? If so, what are treatment options? I was really hoping the pain would eventually just subside.

I’m a 30 year old female. I’m 5’2 and 175 lbs. my fitness level is not great- I’m fairly sedentary. I have a history of Preeclampsia, panic disorder, ADHD and generalized anxiety disorder. I’m not on any medications. 

I have a question about my heart rate. When I’m sitting and at rest is stays anywhere between 72-88 bpm (depending on stress levels). 

However, when I stand it seems to jump to 104-108 bpm and continues climbing. Normal activities like cooking or doing laundry can keep it between 120-140 bpm. I was raking leaves yesterday and as soon as I started it was about 130 bpm. Panic attacks (when they happen) can be anywhere between 120 and 160 bpm for me. Things go back to baseline fairly quickly as soon as I sit and rest. 

Is this a normal jump in heart rate? I feel like it goes fast relative to the activity level I’m doing. I do have pretty severe anxiety so I just assumed this was part of that deal. I definitely feel anxious about my heart being fast when I stand so I’m sure that doesn’t help. I should also point out it doesn’t go that fast all the time just sometimes. 

It’s made me nervous to exercise because I don’t want to “push” it. I have a lot of heart anxiety as it is, despite numerous ekgs and holter monitors coming back healthy.

The day after I finished antibiotics, my primary care doc listened to my lungs and said they sounded good and to go home and rest. Both COVID tests (urgent care and primary docs) came negative, as well as flu tests.

Fast forward to today, still no fever, but persistent heavy cough - feels like there's mucus in my chest that just won't come up.

As the title says, I'm unable to workout since around 4-5 years. After 5-10min of working out (running, crossfit, gym), my skin itches to the point it triggers a panic reaction in me. It's the worst itch you can imagine. My skin usually also turns red, but not always. I tried different types of clothing (shorts, leggings, loose, tight etc.), materials, detergents. It doesn't seem to be the cause. I also tried working out in the morning before I eat. It didn't help. It worsens when the workout becomes more intense. I'm usually afraid to continue because I don't want to trigger the itch. The only workout that doesn't cause itching is swimming.
I have a history of allergies (dust mites, pets, some trees), but they haven't really bothered me. No sneezing, coughing, shortness of breath etc. The only one that sometimes slightly triggers me is dust mites allergy when I'm in a very dusty space. I had the tests done because when I was 11 I had an asthmatic bronchitis. No asthma symptoms or anything similar since that time.
Other than that, I'm diagnosed with PCOS and currently on Spironolactone and birth control. The itching started before I started taking them. I also had an eczema on my hands but it cured 4 years ago.
I have no idea what causes the itching. I'd like to workout like any other person. Has someone heard of anything like that?

She has been doing everything to avoid the surgery by drinking teas and taking supplements. Of course, none of her remedies work and she lives with chronic debilitating pain. What makes matters worse is that she works as a custodian further exacerbating her pain.

I get really itchy especially outer thighs, knees, back, and underside of forearms.  If I scratch, my skin breaks out into what looks like a ton of mosquito bites.  Not red, just bumps.  These continue to itch and feel hot until eventually going away.  No new meds, no allergies of any kind, same lotions/soaps/detergents I've used my whole life.  Using lotion for skin hydration does not help.  It's uncomfortable enough to prevent me from sleeping at night.  Anyone familiar with this oddity?  Should I see a dermatologist or other kind of Dr?

fzqnht,Subdermal infection from possible ruptured cyst?,"Male, 32, 150lbs, 5'10"", no medications and non smoker.  

I've had some sort of a subdermal cyst in my left upper thigh that may have had something trapped underneath for a few months. I was messing around with it the other day without thinking and it accidentally ruptured, causing it to swell and redden. I'm feeling fine overall but the localized area is sore. I'm a bit worried that the infection will spread since it may be close to a major artery. Due to COVID19, I am a bit hesitant to seek out medical treatment because 1) risk of exposure to myself and 2) taking away from doctors' resources and time if this is something that will go away on its own.

Just wondering if this is something I should seek treatment for or it can be postponed until a less medically strained time?

The itch has also gotten more aggressive over the last month. So much so that I've actually scratched a little of the skin off on my left leg.

Preface: 28yo female, married, on Yasmin for two years. 

As the title suggests, I’ve been facing this chronic itch for awhile. I’ve tried everything. Went to the doctor, change soaps, underwear OTC creams... you catch the drift. There is no odour or discharge. 

Bunch of tests (which indicated nothing was wrong) and a pap smear later, doctor told me that it could be due to hormonal imbalances from the birth control and to put some moisturiser down there. Didn’t help. 

I’ve tested for the works. Everything comes up negative. The only thing that helps relieve the itchiness is cortisone cream I bought on amazon. However I find when I stop using it after a couple of days, the itchiness comes back. 

I’m at my wits end here, I’ve neglected it before because I was busy with work. Now with the quarantine and much time to think, I’ve realised 6 months flew by and I still have a persistent itch that’s making me increasingly worried.

[28][F], Non smoker, occasional drinker(in weekends), taking vitamin D till May, and Pentaprazole for whole of January. 153cm height, 54kg weight. No other illnesses.

I am on combination pills (28 days) ,unfortunately I am not very disciplined about the time (have missed 2 sometimes, and don't always take it at the same time) because I am not sexually active. I got on pills more for irregular period, heavy bleeding and intense cramps. 

I had sex without condoms on March 6, 7 and 8, and I am worried about possible pregnancy. I can't rely on missed period because I hardly get bleeding during withdrawal days. I already took two tests, one on April 3rd, and one yesterday, April 11, and both showed negative. I haven't got any pregnancy related symptoms except feeling my heartbeat faster since two weeks.

Can I be assured that it is negative or do I have to take more tests/visit the doctor to confirm? I have two more tests left with which I plan on taking in 3 days interval even though I think it is already enough days since sex for the hormone hcg to be detectable if I am pregnant.

Any advice? I am just nervous about when to finally rule out pregnancy.

Three weeks ago I suddenly developed a persistent dry cough and what feels like a very dry throat, sometimes a bit like sandpaper. In the beginning it wasn't too annoying but throughout those three weeks I had other symptoms.

For three days after week 1, every time I coughed I had a sharp pain in my lungs.

Since week 2, some days I have a stuffy nose, usually when I wake up in the mornings.

Since a couple days ago, every time I cough my throat ""closes up"" and for a few seconds after coughing I can't take a breath or swallow.

Furthermore, lately now I've had to burp after I cough, not sure if it's from me trying to breathe when my throat is closed?

Any idea what this could be? Should I go see a doctor? I don't have any other symptoms and I feel like the cough is slowly improving but then I have bad days again... I am hesitant to go to the doctor due to Corona as I don't want to waste their resources on ""just a cough""

Lately after a shift I wake up with extreme muscle pain. It’s so bad I have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning and end up throwing up before heading out to work. This only happens after I’ve had a shift and not during my days off. It’s like I’m over-worked or exhausted. I sleep lots (8 or 9 hrs) and I like to think myself as fairly healthy. 

This has been going on for 3 months, but 4 weeks ago I had a fever so got tested for Covid 19 and tested negative and once the 14 days were up I’m back at work with the same sore muscles and nausea in the mornings. 

In all the 5 years I’ve worked there I have never experienced anything like it. Can anyone tell me why this might be happening?

fzw3s4,A strange rash,"What is this rash?

Hi guys,

I was hoping you may be able to help me. I’ve been having this weird skin thing for a while now (maybe around 3-4 years) and was hoping someone may be able to shed some light as to what it might be. 

I’m 29 year old female with no underlying health conditions, and therefore taking no medications. I am a non-smoker, height 4’10 and weight is 100lb (BMI 21) in case that is relevant. I don’t have any allergies apart from latex that I know of. This “rash” comes and goes, lasts around 30 mins - 1 hr ish and appears in different parts of my body. Can happen at different time’s of the day/in different locations. It’s not itchy or painful, I think it may appear after I scratch myself very lightly but doesn’t always appear after scratches. I’ve had other people tell me my face/neck area is really red with this and I haven’t “felt” it. No cold/other allergy symptoms like runny nose or sneezing etc. 

I’m freaked out that it could be something completely gross and I thought I had relatively good hygiene and maybe I don’t so I’ve got OCD thoughts swirling around my mind after someone suggested scabies/dust mites. I can’t go to a doctor at the moment who can see it so would really appreciate some help. I wasn’t sure if it was something harmless like dermatographia. 

Thank you!!

fzx4hi,[26F] Just diagnosed with a SLAP Labrum Tear in my shoulder - why did it go away and come back so frequently this whole time?,"I am a 26 YO Caucasian female who drinks casually, on loloestrin and fluoxetine (not that this is relevant to my question). 5'1, 126lbs. I live a pretty active lifestyle and have had outdoor physical jobs as well as a history of overhead throwing sports for a few years. 

I have had what I thought was frozen shoulder for about 4 years now. It started out as a deep pain in my shoulder overnight and then the next day I would not be able to move my shoulder at all and it was a sharp pain with any excessive movement. I thought it was frozen shoulder due to it going away after 2 weeks, not hurting for a few days to a few weeks as I mostly regained movement in my shoulder, and then coming back with the same level of pain before (freezing and unfreezing). 

Didn't do anything about it until recently this whole year I would have weeks where I could not even lift my shoulder. I have to brush my hair or do makeup with the other arm, among other losses in regular activity. I got an MRI after visiting an Ortho this past October (long story short, couldn't continue because I changed careers and didn't have the funds to deal with it). Well it got so bad this past month (feeling my shoulder slipping and feeling like it was going to dislocate) and I finally just went in this past week where my Oct MRI confirmed I had a labral tear. I'm going in a week to get an arthroscopic MRI to see the damage. Definitely ready for surgery - my boyfriend had the same exact one and is doing so much better - I'm ready to be able to rock climb and kayak again!!!

But why did the pain go away for days and weeks at a time? Was it healing and reopening? Will they be able to see the old wounds in this arthroscopic MRI?

fzxrnr,Help me get over my vaccine hesitancy. (Be kind),"When my daughter had her 2 month shots (DTAP-IPV-HIB, and prevnar) years ago, she had a bad reaction. I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere. And I dont think our healthcare staff handled it appropriately looking back. She had a high pitched wail for hours on end between deep deep sleeps, labored breathing, fever, and was very lethargic (no eye contact) and wouldnt feed well. The nurse said I was being a worried first time mother, over the phone and said she was fine. I literally watched her 24/7 until about 3 days later she started to come around. In my reading I found that DTAP can be a little harder than prevnar or MenC vaccines, so at the next visit I skipped DTAP and did those. She did not even react to those 2 vaccines. After this I just stopped. (I know I know) 

Before all this happened I was very pro-vaccine. I used to be a quality control chemist for a pharmaceutical manufacturer and even dabbled in R&amp;D. Let me also add that I am very auto-immune. To the point of almost dying twice. I have also had rare reactions to medications like drug induced lupus to remicade and anaphylaxis to codeine. I am allergic to several medications and antibiotics. Big pharma products have hurt me, but they have also saved my life. Being in and out of hospitals I have seen the good and the bad in the healthcare system. Currently I am in 100% remission thanks to stelara. 

And I have never been sure of my decision to stop shots and I have been relying on herd immunity while I figure it out. I want to protect her, but I also fear that she will become autoimmune.

All this said I have made an appointment to have her first shot in years and she will be getting MMRV at the age of 12. If all goes well I will restart her DTAP-IPV series.

g01u6m,Excruciating burn after ejaculation,"Hello, I'm an underweight male, 20 years old. Not smoking, drinking or anything of the sort.

My main complaint is a serious burning sensation after ejaculation. It does not happen every time, but it does happen more often than not. The burn usually begins either right after (not during) or up to 15 minutes after ejaculation. When it begins, it usually builds up for about 20 minutes until the burning sensation peaks. This peak can be anywhere from a major inconvenience, to an excruciating burn, lasting about 15 more minutes or so, until it gradually begins to subside. The whole ordeal I would say, usually lasts about an hour. The sensation can be felt primarily in the penis, and pelvic floor area. Sitting on hard surfaces, or squeezing of the pelvic floor muscles worsens the burn. These episodes are accompanied by great urges to urinate (sometimes also defecate), and frequent urination.

Something I find interesting about this is, that it mostly happens after masturbation, and rarely after sex. Which lead me to suspect that improper handling during masturbation was the cause. Although there were a few times where I awoke in the middle of night after a wet dream, only to feel this burning sensation, therefore I doubt that it has anything to do with handling (needless to say these wet dreams didn't involve handling at all).

Since the symptoms resemble the symptoms of a UTI (I think), I would think it's important to state that, to my knowledge, I have never actually had a UTI, let alone suffer from recurring UTIs.

I have had this problem ever since I can remember. It can't be an STD since I have had it years before any sexual contact. Nothing I try to do before or after masturbation seems to consistently prevent it. I have tried: Drinking lots of water, handling very gently, urinating right before the act, urinating right after or rather holding the urine until a while after.

This problem is a major inconvenience, to a point where I would either masturbate very rarely, or avoid it altogether.

Height: 5ft 7""

Hey guys. I recently started getting this sore looking thing on the corner of my lip. There's no rash, no breakout, no itching or cluster of pimples or bumps. It usually starts as a blue black mark and then a bruise-ish mark, turns almost into a black scab and gets like this (image) before it heals.
I've been with only my wife and we are both faithful. I've had my last sexual encounter 2 years ago and I got tested 3 months later for HSV I &amp; II (both IGM and IGG), HIV AND VDRL and was non-reactive in all. 
Back in February this happened to me and now again.
I'm attaching a picture for reference. 

My wife also developed a single puss filled pimple on her inner labia on both occassions when I got this, but on these both occasions we attempted really dry sex so I assumed that caused it. 
We pop her pimple and within 3 days it goes away.

This only began happening in February and this is the second time. 

I described and included my wife's issue because I'm not sure if it's related or just a coincidence.

We kept watch on it Thursday and Friday, alternating ibuprofen and Tylenol. The second the meds wore off, the fever would spike right back up. Fever started at 101.2 on Thursday and jumped to 102.4 Friday night. Saturday morning, it was 102.7 so I called the doctor. They had us come in yesterday morning and he said that her ears were only slightly inflamed  but that her lymph node on her right side was swollen. He said he thought it was the beginning stages of ear infections and prescribed a  azithromycin for three days. We are supposed to give her 4ml every day. I gave her the dose yesterday at 11:00 a.m.
Last night around 8, she spiked a temp of 103.7. This was when the meds had worn off and we gave her more, but it only ever went down to the 102 range. Today, it has fluctuated between 100.7-102.5. 
I’m worried that the antibiotic isn’t working... and extra worried because tomorrow is our last dose. 
She eats decently. Less more than usual, but is still eating well. She’s alert and fussy... and really fussy when the meds start to wear off. But she still tries to play and she interacts some of the time like she normally would.

I took a fall in early July 2019 and was unsure of whether I hit my head. I ended up getting an MRI of my brain much later, in November 2019. My question is, if I were to have suffered some sort of brain damage, would it have still shown on my MRI nearly 4 months later? Does brain damage ever not heal and disappear from imaging after a certain period of time? I know some brain damage like mild TBI wouldn’t show on an MRI to begin with, but I’m wondering if brain damage eventually disappears from an MRI when otherwise it would have shown directly after the injury",1,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g03v27/does_brain_damage_always_show_on_an_mri/"")",2020-04-12 13:14:23,Physician Responded

I’ve had pain in my left leg(mostly thigh), right leg(thigh and calf) and one spot on my right arm for a few months now. I’m also experiencing chest pain l(that could be ddue to my back being super tight) I’m worried about having blood clot(s) and well...dying.

I’ve also been experiencing bouts of nausea(no vomiting), headaches and simply feeling “off”.

I’m a hypochondriac and in my my mind have had als, strokes and heart issues(my heart was just checked with ultra sound like two weeks ago).

I haven’t been too active lately due to feeling off all the time so I’m worried my inactivity has caused clots to form.

g04olp,I'm an 18yo male and I think I just lactated.,"(repost because my last post got no attention)

Well, almost 18, male, white, about 180cm, about 90kg, no current conditions other than what I'll try and describe, no current medications.

  


Hi guys. So, in one of my nipples, I think I have gynecomastia and I've had it for a while now. I'm hoping that it will resolve, and a course hair has just recently started growing on its edge, so I'm hoping this is just something that will resolve with time and some maturing.

  


Anyhow, I saw online that apparently, males can lactate if the circumstances are right. I tried doing it, and, shockingly, I managed to squeeze a tiny bit of clear- to slightly white-looking fluid from both of my nipples (even the left one, which seems more normal for a male). Now, as I said, I'm pretty sure I have gynecomastia in one nipple and might even have it in another. I've got some moobs (but I'm also a bit of a fatass so that could play a part), and the tissue in them does seem to be somewhat... Grainy. Lumpy. I don't know. The right one more so than the left. The right one has a really visible areola. Both get much harder and lose their plump appearance when fiddled around with, or when it's cold.

  


What do I do? Obviously, I'm concerned about my masculinity and fertility and testosterone levels and everything. I don't think I've got low T, though. I've got what I consider a decent beard for my age, decent body hair (although my chest hair has only been growing relatively recently), normal sized testicles I think, decent muscles and strength, decently wide shoulders, and a fairly well-functioning penis, I think. Don't get too much morning wood though. Used to get more of it when I was younger, weirdly. But I can obviously get it up and ejaculate, and I do get aroused.

  


Is this normal? Should I do something about it?",0,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g04olp/im_an_18yo_male_and_i_think_i_just_lactated/"")",2020-04-12 13:59:12,Physician Responded

g06mz2,Is There An Endocrinologist Here That Can Explain How I Wound Up Much Shorter Than Average Despite Coming From A Tall Family?,"I'm a 25 year old white male living in the United States and my adult height is 5 ft 2, a little less than the 1st percentile for an adult male.  Even though i'm very short, what's even more unusual is that I actually come from a relatively tall all-white family. Both of my grandfathers were 6 ft or taller along with my uncle, and many of the cousins on both sides of the family.  My grandmothers are average height along with my mom and dad who are 5 ft 5 and 5 ft 10 respectively.  Nobody in my family is significantly shorter than average, i'm the only one.  I was not malnourished as a kid either, I live in a upper-middle class family.   


I was always shorter than average as a kid; probably around the 5th of 10th percentile. Mom took me to an endocrinologist when I was 10 years old and my bone age came back the same as my biological age so the doctors decided not to give me any treatment thinking that I was going to grow later in life. This later turned out to be a big mistake.   


I started puberty relatively early. At 10 years old, my voice was already starting to crack. When I entered 6th grade, I was one of the few kids whos voice was starting to lower. Some of the kids even noticed I had a tiny mustache, which they found odd.   I did the majority of my growth in 6th and 7th grade but only grew a half inch around 14. I also took adderall throughout my early childhood including all of my 8th grade year and half of my 9th grade year. At the age of 15, my mom was concerned that I had hardly grown in the past year so she took me to an endocrinologist. I had a bone age scan done and the doctors told me I had a bone age of 17, two years advanced, and that I wasn't going to get any taller.  I was only 5 ft 2.   


So I have several questions that I don't know if they can be answered.  Why and how did I wind up much shorter than average?  Is there an explanation?   Why did I have short stature and an advanced bone age?  Are there anything sort of genetics mutations that could have caused this?   


  
*tldr version.  I'm a 5 ft 2 male despite coming from a tall white upper middle class family.  My bone age was 2 years advanced and I took adderal and vyvance as a kid.  I want to know why I wound up much shorter than average.*

g07hqx,"30yo f, 4 lymph node lumps, painless, fixed and very hard.","Hi guys,

A little background. I’m a 30 year old female, fit and active with no health issues. No recent colds or flus or infections.

Recently my husband noticed a lump whilst massaging me. Needless to say we were given a scare and rang the doctors the next morning.

Bloods have been taken on Thursday and should be back in the next few days.

The lump is painless, fixed, the skin just moves over the top of it, it basically feels like a hard bean or large pea stuck under my skin.

Whilst checking other areas I have since found two more. A very large one under my arm, also hard and fixed. And another at the back of my lower scalp.

The doctor is arranging an ultrasound, hopefully I won’t have to wait too long. I just would like answers at this point.

My only other symptom is extreme tiredness, naps in the afternoon and muscle weakness that usually I do not feel. I also have to clear my throat of phlegm a lot and have a very hoarse voice due to this. I also experience a lot of hot flashes and face burning with heat randomly.

A lot of my OCD centers around health/health anxiety. Obviously the current world situation is not helping. I have been even MORE obsessive about my health (I check and record my temperature at least once an hour, I bought an oximeter, I constantly check reports about what symptoms may be signs of COVID... etc). 

Recently I have been checking my lymph nodes OBSESSIVELY. Over the past few days my neck has become somewhat sore, and my lymph nodes seem to have enlarged a little bit. However, I have no other symptoms of COVID or any other illness. I have had a slight (productive) cough but I have attributed that to allergies (very very high pollen in my area). 

I actually have two questions: 1. Can checking/prodding your lymph nodes a ton (like... probably at least 10 times an hour...) cause them to swell slightly? 2. Can allergies cause lymph nodes to swell (I have seen conflicting reports on this)?

It’s not painful to the touch, but it does hurt when I sit or put pressure on it. Not excruciating, but bad enough that I have to readjust how I’m sitting. 

After doing brief research it seems like it could be a boil, cyst, or a pilonidal cyst. Either way, it seems the main concern is that it could become infected.

It all started with a cold I had gotten in November of 2018. Around this exact time I had also began a new job so not sure if they’re corralled (working in a fairly dirty environment at a truck and auto shop). Anyways, I noticed this issue was lasting me all through April of 2019. I decided then that several months was long enough of me just waiting it out and seeing if it would go away in its own before seeing a doctor. I made an appointment with my general doctor. She thought it was an infection or some sort and gave me meds. (Can’t exactly remember what it was but if really needed I can see if I can find paperwork in it). I waited some more on these meds and nothing changed. Went back about a month or two later. She thought this time it might be allergies due to where I had started working. I tried a proscription Flonase, that’s what I was told. Tried it for about a month or so with not even the slighted result. I gave up. Waited several months again before seeing another doctor. Finally I was allowed to see a ENT doctor. I was happy because I thought he would definitely help. He only peeked into my nose with these small plier like tools and a flashlight. Said my nasal Turbinates were inflamed. He gave me shots up my nose. Said I should see relief in about 3 days. I asked if I didn’t see results what else we could try? He said the only thing left would be surgery. (I thought surely there’s more I can try besides 2 meds and a couple of shots before resorting to surgery). I left excited and hopeful that in a few days I would be normal again and breathe just fine. I didn’t. I didn’t go back because that doctor made me feel uncomfortable... It’s now been over a year and a half of me having this issue. It’s been getting worse I believe. I’m having difficulty eating, sleeping, exercising! I have to breath through my mouth which is causing my throat to hurt now as well and on top of alllll this I think I might have Asthma... I should be able to breathe normal through my mouth but yet when I do I don’t feel like I’m getting enough air. I catch myself yawning several times back to back. And when mid yawn I have to yawn again (like another inhale) I’ve given up. I don’t know what else to do. I look up my nose but cant tell if it’s normal or not. My face is starting to hurt from the pressure to the point I’m getting headaches almost everyday now and my ears feel like they want to pop, like I’m under water.

Current meds: ketamine nasal spray(pain), IV/IM benadryl, toradol, zofran, medical marijuana
Nicotine user 

I have EDS, POTS and Mast Cell Activation Syndrome as my main DX. Two years ago I needed help managing my conditions and connected with palliative care to help coordinate. At the time I was not managing well. They were able to coordinate with PCP, physical therapy, home health, pain management and neurology and I met with their social worker several times before getting a letter in the mail informing me that they were dropping all non Medicare patients(?!). I have since dramatically improved and am able to manage my own care. I have a chest port that was supposed to be removed last month, but was canceled as an elective surgery. I am trained in port care and am accessing to flush/lock the line until it can be removed. 

In light of COVID19, I am wondering if the fact that I am (was? Not sure if being dropped by one company means I am no longer considered palliative?) on palliative care will prevent me from receiving life saving measures if it becomes an issue? Or is the palliative care designation only in regards to my existing diagnosis? I would want to be treated within reason if I was experiencing symptoms including cytokine storm, which MCAS could make me more susceptible to.",3,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g0aeno/palliative_care_and_covid19/"")",2020-04-12 19:53:11,Physician Responded
g0ago3,Weird feeling in the back of my throat that makes me continuously clear my throat. Kinda feels like I want to cough but i don’t. What could it be?,"
Title says all. Im 19 and a male. I weigh 146 pounds, height 5’11. No health conditions and no medication taken (except for nasal congestion). Since last Tuesday, I believe i was getting a cold because my nose became congested and unable to breath through it (still manageable, nothing serious). My congestion started the 31st of march and I still have it to this day. But, my cough symptoms began last week Tuesday (April 7th). Only thing I felt was my throat beginning to feel something more and more in the back which felt like a cough was coming if i didn’t do anything about it if it makes sense. I didn’t feel like coughing or got a fever of any sort when I had the symptom. I drank nyquil liquid along with gargling salt water for 3 days and the feeling went away on friday that same week. Only thing I have is a little bit of nasal congestion but what im curious is why I still feel like I have something at the back of my throat which makes me clear it a lot. I’m not coughing or anything its just irritating to clear my throat often and the feeling comes back. Finally, sometimes I pull with my throat from my nose to spit it out (if that makes sense) and i sometimes clear my throat to spit out small quantities of mucus. The color is clear!

So my question is:

What could this feeling on the back of my throat be that makes me clear my throat oftenVCould it possibly be I still have a cold? Post nasal congestion? COVID19?

what can i do to get rid of the feeling in the back? Or will it go away on its own?

And is it concerning to go to a doctor since it will be almost a week with the feeling in the back?",1,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g0ago3/weird_feeling_in_the_back_of_my_throat_that_makes/"")",2020-04-12 19:56:33,Physician Responded

A few days ago I've been getting a weird noise in my left ear when I move my jaw to the right. It's like the squeak an old spring balance makes when you stretch it. It's not constant, only when my jaw moves to the right. Moving to the left doesn't cause a similar sound in my right ear, which is how it's always been on both sides. I don't get the sound when moving my jaw back to the neutral position. I first noticed the sound when I was chewing, and I only managed to reliably get it to show up on purpose 10 minutes ago. I'm not sure how vague the info here sounds to a doctor, but I felt like I finally had enough information to properly describe what was going on so I could ask someone.

g0ak3m,bug bite identification request + advice,"Hello!

I've recently become a victim to an onslaught of bug bites. I don't know what bug it is. Here is a link to them: [https://photos.app.goo.gl/ikueX4vsVUZzSYVF9](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ikueX4vsVUZzSYVF9) (NOT GRAPHIC, just bites) I have labeled each picture with their location. These were all within the week except for one picture, which I've noted as older.

I'm 18F, 5'8"", \~140lbs. I live in the Santa Clara, Bay Area of California, USA. I have idiopathic urticaria (chronic hives) and take a daily Zyrtec pill and nightly Benedryl to manage my symptoms. (My hives may be why the bites appear more swollen/worse than they are. They don't itch much, but I have a lot of tolerance for itchy things because of my chronic hives). I have not been scratching the bites.

This has never happened to me before this badly unless I went camping and got attacked by mosquitos. I've been following the stay-at-home lockdown/quarantine orders for my area, so all these bites were sustained within my home. I have not gone outside whatsoever, not even to the back or front yard.

Possibilities:

\- fleas? I have a dog, but he doesn't sleep inside the house. He has free reign of the garage and backyard, and I've been playing with him ever since I got home from college. He does not have bug bites.

\- bed bugs? I sleep in my own room on my childhood bed. Nobody has slept in this bed since I left for college in September. I did not get bug bites while in college.

\- other? My dad does not have any bug bites, and he lives in my childhood home with me, sits on the same chairs, couches, and plays with the dog. My sister recently got 2 bug bites on her legs. I don't know if she has more, but mine are the most severe and I have the most in an outrageous quantity.

It’s different than a sore muscle, though, and unusual. Not horribly painful, just odd and uncomfortable. Almost like dense fluid.

g0b3h1,"Facial / Scalp Folliculitis, lymphadenopathy, tonsillitis for 3 years.","**Info:** 24 year old male, 5""9, 160 pounds. No significant medical history (before now).

&amp;#x200B;

**Signs &amp; Symptoms:** Beginning roughly 3 years ago, I began to experience a painful outbreak of inflamed, red, pus filled bumps on my scalp several weeks after a dexamethasone injection for poison ivy (unsure if related). Concomitantly, the lymph nodes behind both of my ears swelled up. I bought a salicylic acid shampoo that kept it somewhat under control as long as I used it regularly (the lymphadenopathy persisted regardless). If I stopped using the shampoo, the folliculitis would return completely. 6 months after the initial outbreak on my scalp, the area around my mouth, chin, and nose suddenly broke out in an inflamed, pus-filled rash. At the same time, the lymph nodes underneath my jaw swelled up. At this point, I made an appointment with my dermatologist who prescribed me doxycycline. Within several days of beginning the doxycyline, my scalp and face were completely clear. However, even continuing the doxycline, the folliculitis slowly began to come back over the initial two weeks of treatment. I continued using the doxycycline for roughly 6 months until it completely stopped being effective. At that point, my dermatologist switched me to rifampicin + clindamycin for 3 months. The combo antibiotic completely got rid of the folliculitis, but the folliculitis returned only several days after ceasing treatment. At that point, my dermatologist put me on bactrim indefinitely. Several months after starting the bactrim, my right tonsil swelled up and appeared infected with pus-filled spots. I am unsure if the tonsillitis is related to the folliculitis, but my tonsil has not returned to normal nearly a year later. In fact, in the past couple months, it has become even more swollen. I now have a bitter, sour taste in my mouth, halitosis (no evidence of tonsil stones), and a foul smelling discharge from my right ear (the same side as the tonsil). Also, the bactrim has become less effective at controlling the folliculitis over time (similarly to the doxycline), so my dermatologist now has me on cephalexin. My dermatologist is unsure what could be going on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Important Notes:** The pustules have been cultured twice. One time returned a negative result, the other time returned only normal skin flora (per my dermatologist's words). However, both times I was taking an antibiotic (unsure if that affects culture results), so the folliculitis was largely under control at the time of culture, and there really wasn't anything to culture. He basically just found a spot of skin that looked slightly red and tried to get something out of it. Also important to note, the only history of skin trouble is mild-moderate acne in early high school.

g0by47,Extreme itchiness with no rash,"Hi, I'm a 5'10, slightly overweight, 21 year old biological female who drinks and eats edibles fairly frequently. I have a kind of specific problem with a kind of specific background for it sooo here we go lol

In summer 2018, I moved from north Florida to south California. Before I moved, I had no allergies. However, when I got there, the AC in the house broke and I weathered the harsh heatwave Cali had that year in a very sick and fatigued state that lasted 3 months. Ever since then, I've experienced symptoms such as runny nose, frequent sneezing, and watery/itchy eyes during allergy season and around cat hair that I've never experienced before. Fast forward to now and I moved back to Florida a month and a half ago. While I lived in the city in California, here I live in the middle of the woods with wayyyy more bugs. This all sounds pretty convoluted but stick with me.

A few days after moving back, I started experiencing a pretty intense generalized itch. It will randomly flare up in a spot or two, and when I scratch it, it flares up somewhere else. It's not an every day thing, maybe two or three week? Though sometimes it becomes very extreme and lasts multiple days in a row. During the longer flare-ups, I will also get frequent chills that give me painful goosebumps and tingles. I switched to a skin sensitive laundry detergent and fabric softener, started taking allergy medication, and I moisturize more (even though I have oily skin that never gets very dry); but the symptoms seem to come back slightly worse each time. The places where the itch pops up never have any visible bite marks or rashes.

Is this just a strange allergic reaction to my reintroduced environment or is something else going on? I plan on seeing a doctor soon but wanted to see if I could find any relief beforehand, as I'm currently enduring the most intense flare-up yet.

More info because I'm detail-oriented and paranoid:

• I do have a weird rash under my breasts that I'm treating with anti-fungal right now (it's clearing up!). It doesn't itch any more than the rest of me and I believe it's just from sweat build-up from wearing chest binders. I actually had it before moving here but I figured I'd mention it.

• We have an outdoor cat that comes inside a few times a day and an indoor dog. Both get flea medication every month or so. Sometimes their fur can trigger the itching, but I also lived with a cat and dog in California and they did not make me this itchy. 

• There have been multiple spiders in my room and on my bed since I got here. But I don't think I've been bit by any.",1,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g0by47/extreme_itchiness_with_no_rash/"")",2020-04-12 21:33:00,Physician Responded

Couple weeks ago started noticed a little discomfort (1/10 pain) upper left abdomen that has stayed ever since.  Immediately stopped drinking when it started and it had about gone away completely and I decided to experiment to see if it was alcohol related.  Drank several beers and woke up with the noticeable discomfort again.  Not “pain” but more like “hmm something is up with this area” also the discomfort occasionally is on the right upper abdomen too and rarely even lower back.  Feel a little swelling under ribs left side that doesn’t hurt.  Talked to three doctors honestly and they all said not to worry.  Obviously not drinking again until it heals and I can get some tests done but also obviously don’t wanna be told I can never drink alcohol again selfishly.  Idk just nervous cause I’ve never had health problems :( could it be a warning sign of pancreatitis?",1,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g0cst6/scared_of_pancreatitis/"")",2020-04-12 22:35:39,Physician Responded

g0d91l,Marks on scrotum NSFW,"So I've had a couple white/lighter blotches on my scrotum that are ranging from like .5 to 2cm in width. I had a couple of those marks maybe dating back a year, occasionally they would have like a pinching itching sensation and I had figured it was me responding to that, that was causing the marks. Recently though the number of marks have increased and have also started appearing on the underside of my penis shaft although smaller sizes. I have been sexually active but around 4 years ago and even then only with a single partner. Issue has only appeared in the last year maybe, so I don't believe it's related, but obviously not too sure.

22, Male, 6', 102Kg, White. Started about a year ago. Appearing on genitals. I've had eczema on my legs, no medications.

I haven't taken any pictures of the issue. Feel uncomfortable supplying one, but can do if believed will absolutely help give an answer. Cheers.

g0da3w,I'm worried that I wont be able to be prescribed clonazepam tomorrow due to a new doctor.,"I'm a 26 year old male who's been prescribed 1mg clonazepam daily for over a year and I'm on my last one. My original doctor is from NJ and I moved to CO in November. It's been near impossible getting a doctors appointment until a few days ago where I was able to finally secure a telecom appointment.

The appointment went well and now i need to take a urine test at the office [which is closed today, easter sunday]. I've been cutting my clonazepam double for the past few days so I'm starting to feel anxious and tomorrow will be my last dose.

I believe the doctor told me she can call the testing place before my results come in so I can get my prescription before that, but I'm not sure.

Hey Docs! 

I have this suspicious black spot on my foot. It appeared a couple of days ago and it is right under the skin. I poked through the skin to see what it was and I am not sure. My friend thinks its dry blood but I'm not entirely sure. I have had it for a couple of days and just want to know if I should get it checked out.

I have no prior medical conditions and do not drink, smoke, or take any medication.

White, only medical condition is alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency 

Maybe once or twice a year I get these episodes, for lack of a better word. It starts with feeling dizzy or lightheaded, then I hear a ringing that gets louder and louder, I start feeling numb and get that pins and needles feeling all over my body. At this point I’m too dizzy to stand and kinda pass out, I think around a minute or two later the symptoms slowly subside. 

There’s usually a trigger, most of the time a movie with something particularly gruesome, but twice I’ve had an episode with no trigger. I had assumed these episodes were vasovagal syncope but upon reading some comments about seizures I think that might be what happened.

I haven’t spoken to anyone about these episodes and given how rarely they happen it’s not a big deal.

No known preexisting conditions except for that the HDGC gene runs in my family (I found this out recently after family members were diagnosed with stomach cancer). I have not been tested for the gene yet.  

Please help! I am desperate for answers. For a few years now I have been having difficulty moving my bowels completely. Not like I’m constipated but more like I just have this constant feeling of fullness. I went to the dr and had a cat scan of my lower abdomen. No inflammation everything looked relatively normal. Dr recommended a colonoscopy but bc of the price (with insurance) I was unable to get one. All of a sudden I started bleeding a lot. Like instead of shitting I’ve been bleeding instead. This is an issue that has become increasingly worse and regular over time. I credited hemorrhoids as the most likely cause. About a month ago I started vomiting like crazy. Like everyday for two weeks. I went to the doc in the box and she said it was possible stomach ulcers.  Told me I need to get an endoscope (that’s about the time coronavirus hit the us so I never went.) she tested me for h pylori among other things and everything came back negative. Blood test showed my white blood cell count was up. She gave me some Ondansetron and antacids and I have been managing until yesterday. When my stomach started burning in a way that I have never felt. I mean the pain was so bad I got dizzy, could not sit down, and crying. I took a Ondansetron. But I continued to feel pain to the point of nausea. Just a deep burning pain like my stomach acid was burning my stomach up. I started throwing up but I felt only temporary relief each time I did. About four hours later the pain began to subside and I took some pepto bismol and just laid on the floor of my shower with the hot water pouring over me. I’ve had heart burn/ indigestion before but nothing like this. Some combo of the time, shower, and pepto seemed to help and I felt better. 

Until this morning. I woke up with similar pain, (not nearly as strong) nausea and a feeling like I need to shit but I can’t do anything but pass blood.

Symptoms did not improve. Now six months later she is still complaining of same UTI symptoms, painful intercourse and general pelvic pain with random low grade temps. OB diagnosis her with atrophic vulvovaginitis (sp?) and puts her on a course of Cefadroxil. Completes a urinalysis and sends out to lab.

g0ib1s,"Gynaecologists, I need your help! Ureaplasma? Thrush? Frustrated!!","For the past 4 months, I have been experiencing excessive vaginal discharge. It seems to vary in consistency with my cycle - however, is always excessive. TMI, but can literally scoop it out. It is either creamy/milk or sticky, stringy and slightly clumpy. The colour seems to vary too. Sometimes white. with a yellow tinge,  or sometimes slightly yellow/greenish. 

I would say its odourless - I have had BV before and it does not smell like that at all. I would say, it could be described as slightly metallic/acidic smelling. I think I am experiencing some lower abdominal cramping - but that may or may not be period related. Difficult to say. Also, no itchiness or burning.

I have only had sex with one man - I've had all STD checks. After me seeing multiple dismissive doctors, claiming it is normal discharge and they've found nothing. I finally found a doctor who ran a couple of tests, and found I have candida non c.albicans ( i can't find much on the internet about this type of candida.) Also, Ureaplasma urealyticum was detected. She believes we do not need to treat this.

She prescribed me Nilstat nyastin vaginal cream and recommended incorporating probiotics, garlic and greek yoghurt. None of this has worked.  I even took a flucazole pill on my own accord hoping it would contribute. Upon completion of the cream, I couldn't get in touch with my usual doctor as a result of covid19 mania to report that I had no improvement -  another doctor told me I should try the BV/Trichomoniasis medication Flagyl, even though I didn't test positive for it. I was hesitant because I assume antibiotics are likely to exacerbate a yeast infection, especially if taken unnecessarily. However, now i'm wondering if I should anyway.

Finally got in touch with my usual doctor, who now wants me to try a round of boric acid. 

Obviously, I am frustrated and afraid that I have something that i have left untreated for so long as a result of no diagnosis. Is BV and trich always smelly? She believes it would be painfully obvious if I had either due to the odour. She tested for BV (negative) but did not test for trich but as aforementioned, she thinks test isn't necessary as the odour would make it obvious.

g0jqjn,Is there anyway to treat UTI (female) at home?,"So my wife has UTI at the moment and it seems to be mild so far such as irritation/slight pain when peeing, the frequent need to pee, and seldom slight lower abdomen pains but she hasn’t displayed any of the more severe symptoms such as light pink/red pee or nausea.

She has had UTI once before around a few months ago, albeit slightly more severe with the pink pee but she took antibiotics for it to treat it and went away.

My current problem is that is there anyway to treat it at home?

We have ran out of the previous antibiotics, which requires a prescription in my country in all pharmacies, and due to the Covid19 situation it is very hard to go the hospital or clinics just to see a doctor and get a prescription for simple antibiotics. My country is a 3rd world country (Philippines) so going outside or hospitals poses risks to either of us because our healthcare situation regarding Covid is poorly run and maned, and the system is bad for both the frontline health workers and those with medical problems.

Are there any over the counter medicines that can treat UTI or any remedies that can help treat it at home.

g0kehl,Delayed puberty... caused by undescended testicle?,"I'm 16, and will be 17 in July. I'm about 5""3, I don't have any noticable facial/armpit hair. I'm not sure if I have any pubic hair - at first glance I don't see any but if I try real hard there's tiny specks of light colored hair. I have a babyface. I don't think my penis and testicles has grown since I was very young.My voice has obviously changed since from I was a little child, but I sound about 12 with some voicecracks here and there. I'm not sure how tall my dad is but he's much taller than me, but I've long surprassed my mom in height. I can't seem to ejaculate - that is, produce sperm. Sometimes a little bit of liquid comes out, but it's not exactly white, and again, it's just a little bit of liquid. I also haven't had a wet dream - I've had erotic dreams, yes, but I haven't woken up from them ejaculating.

I distinctly remember syringes on my testicles (testosterone maybe??) when I was a child (I think when I was 6), which continued for a few months (again, maybe some sort of hormone therapy?), and I think I got surgery for undescended testicles when I was young, since I was born premature. I remember my parents checking my penile/genital growth when I was around 6-7 years old. Can this undescended testicle thing be a factor? I don't want to ask my parents this since it's such an embarassing subject.

My younger brother is 13 but he's already taller than me and has a deeper voice. Every time we go out in public or meet someone, they always assume my brother is the older one, which makes me really sad. My friends don't bully me for this or anything, but I look the youngest among them, and making new friends my age is basically a pain since they look at me and they instantly think ""what's this 7'th grader doing here.""

g0kpqk,ANKLE INJURY - Torn retinaculum?,"Hi all,

I just want to preface this by mentioning I have limited knowledge of ankle injuries, only what I've found through research about my injury - so I apologise in advance for any incorrect information.

Essentially what happened was; a few months ago I tried to jump a fence but stepped on a curved surface, so when I went to hoist myself up, my ankle bent outwards pretty harshly. Something made a loud ""POP"", and suffice to say, it hurt a lot. I couldn't put weight on it at all. 

For the first few weeks afterwards there was bruising on my ankle and it would often ""pop"", where I could feel/see the ankle tendons moving to the other side of my ankle bone, and I'd have to kinda push them back again.

A few weeks after it first happened I had an ultrasound and an x-ray. After the ultrasound I asked the radiologist what he thought, and he believed that I had completely torn the ""peroneal retinaculum"" in my right ankle, which essentially allows for the tendons to pop over the other side of my ankle bone whenever they want. The data was sent to my GP and they said nothing looked wrong, so I pretty much decided to take the radiologist's word for it as the symptoms I researched were pretty consistent with his diagnosis.

Initially the pop was happening dozens of times a day, now it only happens once or twice a day, particularly if I'm exercising. I think my ankle has naturally built up cartilage or something because it happens less, but the retinaculum definitely hasn't healed. It's been a number of months now and I have no difficulty running on flat surfaces, however I am very wary of slanted or uneven surfaces as they can easily cause it to pop again.

I would be very grateful to anyone offering any suggestions for a solution. It is not majorly affecting my everyday life, but I enjoy running and hiking and it definitely impacts what I am able to do for exercise.

g0kq7h,I have a torn muscle in my hand.,"22f 125lbs. Last july I tore a muscle in my hand on my thumb side. I figured I just sprained it and finally went to a doc four months later (My doctor gave me crap for it) Doc sent me to physio. They said not to use it at all. Well I work in a bakery, I use my hands all day. 

  It started with a severe pain and very stiff. I drop stuff all the time now and I cannot put any weight in it anymore. Now more recently there has been a sharp pain on the other side. Like a hot needle is being pushed into my wrist. It honestly reminds me of when I broke my arm in half and the bone felt strained? Or it was straining?.. I can't move my thumb backwards and making a fist and moving side to side requires some help or great concentration to do. 

  I'm an active person. I want to be police. So therefore working out is a major activity in my life.

Height 5'4

Weight 160 lbs

Medications: 100mg Zoloft daily

no known issues prior to starting Zoloft 2 months ago for post-concussion syndrome.

I've had chronic diarrhea now for approximately 3 weeks. As of last week I started waking up feeling kind of out of it, like the meds were still settling in my system. On the way to work (driving) I became overheated and shaky. The same thing happened the next morning, except at home. I ate applesauce and drank water before I left and made it to work OK. This morning, again, same thing. I feel like my blood sugar is low when I wake up and start to move around.

I know the GI problems I'm having are related to Zoloft. I'm worried about dehydration and passing out. I drink coffee in the morning (black) and lots of water throughout the day. I do not drink alcohol.

Symptoms:

Tight chest, like a rock is on top of it, also center of the chest feel squeezed in

Sore eyes(not from overuse but from “sleepy” type, even just after a while of waking up)

Fatigue, I get tired easily. If I don’t work out in the morning, my energy gets consumed rather quickly, even in quarantine time when I have got nothing to do.

They’ve been going on for a few years.

Below are more recent symptoms that are more noticeable in the last week

Less easy/cannot to stay focused and concentrated in longer time.

Headaches from the back of the skull, the symmetrical points on the left and right are the hot points, they feel very sore and a bit painful when pressed, during the day sometimes It gets really tight and heavy that I must lie down to feel better and function (recently its been intensifying, might from stress and anxiety)

Insomnia and bad sleep, recently I can’t sleep well at all and have a hard time fall into sleep. I cannot sleep whole 8 hours in one setting, sometimes I sleep 3-5 hours in a setting, then try to sleep again and will wake up after an hour or so, if I try again, same 1/1.5 hours. A lot of dreams occur during the shorter sleeps and the end of the longer sleep. Often I feel tired after I wake up, the sleep doesn’t seem to help me rest much. I’ve tried to sleep early, but I’d just toss and turn for hours until I pick up my phone again.

g0ljx2,"I feel tired and feverish when I consume wheat, coffee, or basically anything in tablet form despite having no allergies.","\[22M\] If I eat a bowl of pasta, I'll feel tired, mentally dull, and my vision sometimes feels blurred. I recently took the risk of drinking a cup of coffee and ended up feeling sick. Not nauseous, but like my temperature was rising, and my instinct was to curl up in blankets and fall asleep. Even caffeine in tablet form makes me tired and slow.

I only recently narrowed down a few of the things that make me feel ill.

I eat a little bit of bread, I feel kinda bad. A lot of bread? Feel like I'm incapacitated for up to 24 hours. (I can consume gluten-free bread, though.)

Black coffee? Forget about it. 10% coffee/90% milk? Still feel like I've taken melatonin before bed. Pure caffeine? My reading speed still feels like it goes down by half and I feel like I can't talk without tremendous effort.

The earliest I THINK I can trace feeling like this to is a really weird month from a few years ago where I slept 15+ hours every day and had a low, but stubborn, fever. Following that weird incident, I've felt like there's a fifty fifty chance that I'll feel like crap on any given day.

I got tested for gluten intolerance, wheat allergy, lactose intolerance, and a few other things at a private lab. And nothing. Not a single thing came back positive.

I should also add that following that incident, my TSH levels were elevated beyond the normal range, but turned normal a year or so after.

g0m3kv,[18M] Possible Cubital Tunnel Syndrome in left hand?,"I've been using computers very regularly for the past decade or so, and this is the first time this has been a problem. A few days ago, I noted that there was a slight amount of numbness in the tip of my left pinky finger. I didn't think much of it, and I ran some hot water over it to see if it would heat up and become less numb. However, it didn't, and this morning I woke to realize that the numbness had spread throughout my entire left pinky had become numb, as well as some of the hand below it. I looked up the symptoms and it seems like there's something known as Cubital Tunnel Syndrome that might be the cause. It makes sense, since I spend a lot of my time sitting at a desk and typing on a computer. Are there any home remedies for this, or does it have to be addressed by getting an X-ray and then having surgery?

g0ma2d,Gastroenterology : When is black stool a concern?,"I've had gastritis since this past October. I am currently taking 40mg of Omeprazole daily. 

On Friday, I ate a thick bowl of rice, lentils and squash. I also had some rice krispies treats. I had terrible heartburn followed by pain in my stomach. I had to take 1 Pepcid AC (Famotidine), 2 Pepcid Completes (Famotidine + Calcium Carbonate) and Pepto Bismol (Bismuth Subsalicylate). 

On Saturday, my symptoms were less severe and I took Pepto Bismol, 1 Famotidine, and 1 Pepcid Complete. 

On Saturday and Sunday, my stool was extremely dark. Not inky black but very close to black. I just passed stool today (Monday 1100) and it was a very dark brown, which is abnormal for me since I only eat yellow lentils and butternut squash. My stool is usually a light color. 

Should I be worried? Was it most likely the Pepto Bismol? If I don't take Pepto Bismol again and my stool is near black, should I go to the ER? My stomach is still in a bit of pain/tingling sensation, despite the medication I take. If this is not a concern yet, what color/consistency of my stool would warrant a visit to the ER? I've read that 'tarry' stool is of concern. Does that mean consistency or color? Meaning, if the stool looks like a semi-solid or is liquid?

Im using a throw away account and don’t have much experience posting, so apologies in advance.  I’m 43 year old female. .I’ve developed an itchy, dry, oval rash on my left side near the left breast which is about 8 cm (3 inches) in length.  It came on in early January 2020.  I first thought it was a herald patch due to pityriasis rosea.  It has changed slightly over time from a pink-red slightly raised bump, similar to a mild bug bite to become larger and oddly smooth feeling.  After a while more itchy spots appeared on my lower abdomen.  I went to see a physician who then prescribed 1% Lamisil cream (Terbinafine HCL 1%) for ringworm. I religiously applied it twice a day for 3 weeks in February and I used up most of it with no resolution on any of the spots and in that time I developed more in new places such as my neck, upper chest, right thigh.  I also developed two more on both sides of the hips in an almost mirrored area.  I’ve contacted my gp to try to get a new appointment but due to COVID she was unwilling to get me in to the office and get a skin biopsy done.  She referred me to a dermatologist but this could take a very long time due to Canadian health care waiting times and COVID.  So the only other thing I did was looked at pictures of rashes similar to mine and it appears that this could be T Cell Lymphoma.  Of course this has me a bit scared so I was wondering if someone on this forum could provide some advice?  I’m otherwise healthy.

g0p6fm,"Constant Headaches, could it be CSF Leak?","Dear Doctors of Reddit,

My(21F) boyfriend(22M), height 180, weight 65kg, living in Singapore, do not smoke or drink, suspects that he has CSF Leak. I am writing on his behalf as he is in army and do not have the time to write this. 

He has the following symptoms for a year:
- Watery and clear mucus from right nose 
- Headache on right section of head
- Eye pain (only right eye)
- Neck pain (only right side)
- Tingles down to his right hand 

Prior to this, he had a head trauma from hitting his head too hard from under a stairwell a year ago. 

There is another issue he is currently facing which is his lower back pain:

During September 2019, we went to the hospital about his lower back, butt pain. 

 (The lower back;butt area pain might be a related issue and it also happened a year ago from missing a big step on his right foot and causing trauma to his leg-knees-butt area)

At the doctor's room , I was with him and I casually asked the doctor, (as it wasn't what we were there for) ""Might it be CSF Leak?"", to which he replied ""Don't think so, very low possibility"". 

Is there any possibility to judge from a video or image of the watery mucus that it might be a CSF Leak? 

He has been living with these for a year without being able to find any answers.

As for the back issue, we visited a private doctor and asked for an advice. The doctor told him to bend over and he touched his back, we asked if it might be a slipped disk, he said that its low possibility as he would be in much more pain, but it also could be a slipped disk he can't be sure without an X ray, (which his office does not have), hence he recommend we visit the hospital.",1,7,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g0p6fm/constant_headaches_could_it_be_csf_leak/"")",2020-04-13 11:54:28,Physician Responded
g0pok0,Diarrhea after antibiotics not going away for 3 months,"Hi.  I'm a 39 year old white male who's 6'0'' and 154 pounds.

So, in January I cut my hand and was prescribed antibiotics to treat its swelling, which was pretty significant to the point I couldn't bend my wrist.  I actually saw two doctors about this not long after it swelled up, one in the emergency room and one as a general practitioner, one of which said it just looked like a bruise and the other who thought it was infected.  They both recommended antibiotics, and so I was on clindamycin and cephalexin combo therapy for two weeks, then cephalexin alone for another week by recommendation of a third doctor who I saw after a couple weeks -- I'm uninsured though make just too much for Medicaid, and so I don't see the same doctors all the time.

The swelling went down, but left me with pretty severe diarrhea at the end of the treatment -- completely liquid, nothing solid and with very painful abdominal cramps that sent me to the bathroom several times a day.  I waited a week to see if it'd get better after the antibiotic treatment ended, though when it didn't I went back to the doctor, who prescribed me Flagyl for ten days.  The Flagyl cleared up the diarrhea and gave me normal stools again.

Unfortunately, normal stools only lasted one month.  Very suddenly I had watery diarrhea for a few days, then it got somewhat better, disintegrated stool that vacillated between 6 and 5 on the Bristol Stool Chart for a week.  It wasn't as bad as it was in January and February.  In other words, my abdomen doesn't hurt as much and I haven't had to go to the restroom constantly like directly after the antibiotic therapy ended, only in the morning when I usually have to go, but it was still disconcerting because I've never experienced anything like this.

This time I went to a free clinic I found out about, and saw another doctor.  She tested me for bacterial infections and parasites, had me start probiotics, had my gall bladder and liver imaged, suggested loperamide, and asked me to change my diet to include more whole grains and to monitor the effects of my diet on my stool, specifically if alcohol and dairy are causing it.

I tested negative for bacterial infections and parasites, my gall bladder and liver checked out normal, and I've been monitoring the effects of my diet and probiotics on my stools, though I passed on the loperamide because at the moment I'm wary of starting new medication.  I've gone days with and without milk and alcohol, as suggested by the doctor at the free clinic, though they don't seem to have any effect on the quality of my stools.  The probiotics seemed to help at first, though a pattern started to emerge that made me think something else was going on and the probiotics weren't having an effect.  The pattern is this: over several days my stool goes from liquid to normal, then starts to disintegrate again.  It's been this way since the diarrhea came back in early March, with increasing time with normal stool levels, type 4 on the Bristol Stool Chart.  Last week I had several days of normal stool, the most in a row since the diarrhea came back in early March, with a brief relapse to around 5-6 on the Bristol Stool Chart, and I thought I was getting better because I went nearly two weeks without liquid diarrhea.  This morning though I woke up with stomach cramps and had a totally liquid stool, and became disheartened enough to post here.

Like I said, I don't have health insurance and make about $1,000 too much per month to qualify for Medicaid, so my options at the moment are very limited.  The doctor at the free clinic seems to have exhausted the options she has in her repertoire and has no new suggestions, so I don't know where else to turn.  I never had a problem like this before I took clindamycin and cephalosporin for my swollen hand, and am wondering if that three week antibiotic treatment is going to affect me for the rest of my life.

A week and a half ago I ran out of two of the three probiotics I was taking and haven't replaced them yet -- at the moment I'm only taking Florastor, though I was on Bacid and Fortify probiotics for almost all of March and the beginning of April.  If my stool continues to disintegrate to liquid I'm going to go back on the other probiotics, to see if they were what caused the slight improvement.

Otherwise I'm at a loss as to what to do.  I'm worried there's damage happening to my intestines because of an imbalance in bacteria or an overgrowth of another type or a lack of something that used to be there -- I really don't know, but I do know that diarrhea isn't a sign of health so I can't be at my best internally, and I'm afraid the longer this goes on the more damage is happening inside me.  Though I really don't know because I'm not a doctor.

I'm in the process of moving to a less expensive place to live so I can afford health insurance next year, though I can't apply until November.

He has had this for a week now but it got worse yesterday. It hurts when he barely touches it. On a scale of 1-10 maybe a 7. He does not have health insurance so he can not afford to go to a doc at the moment to get a diagnosis (plus he’s laid off). So his last resort is me bc I’m a licensed nail tech but I have not dealt with something like this before. I believe it is an ingrown fingernail. 

I was thinking I could soak his finger in some peroxide and water to soften up the skin around his nail then I can try to cut the part of the nail that’s piercing his skin. And applying some antibiotic cream? 

I know this is a bit risky but it is his last resort and he can’t stand the pain any longer",1,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g0q2ti/what_is_wrong_with_my_26_m_bfs_finger/"")",2020-04-13 12:41:54,Physician Responded

g0qffh,Experiencing long period and large blood clots,"I am 29F, 5'6"", 373lbs, non smoker, non drinker. 

About 3 years ago, I decided to get off the birth control pill that I was taking since age 16. I then switched to a copper IUD. I didn't have a period for a year. Then I started to menstruate and got my period for a year solid. I asked my gyno about this and they said it was normal for hormones to rebound. 

After that year, my period became pretty regular. But I started to have blood clots the size and consistency of a chicken breast. And I mean multiples of this. Literally just birthing them out. This happens about every 3 months and lasts a couple of days to a week. 

I had to have my IUD replaced about 4 months ago because my first one moved. They only took it out and replaced it with no additional tests. When I went in to the ER for something unrelated, they told me that my iron was so low that they were considering a blood transfusion. I asked my gyno about this and he just shrugged. 

I have currently been bleeding for about 4 months. I made an appt and because of COVID, its been pushed back. Today, I am having severe cramps and these large blood clots. I have literally had 2 in the past two hours push my tampons out. 

Advice? I feel like I am losing my mind and my gyno doesn't seem to mind. 

Also, for a note...I have been calorie restricting (2,500 per day) to lose weight over the last month or so. I started taking advil before bed due to a burning sensation in my thigh.

g0rnyv,Possible Sarcoma. Orthopedic Consultant a nightmare to contact...,"Hello,

 Male age 23. 5ft10, 60kg, no medications and non smoker. No previous health complaints. 

So I have had a small, pea size lump on the back of my hand for approximately 2 years and I decided to get it checked out in February this year. I was referred by my GP to an Orthopedic Consultant for possible Sarcoma. The Consultant initially ordered a X-Ray from which he then ordered a follow up MRI Scan to rule out Sarcoma; he said if the MRI scan is clear he won't have to see me again. Following the results of the MRI Ireceive two follow up appointments for a CT Scan and a Ultrasound, which was then subsequently cancelled due to the Coronavirus outbreak. I contacted my Consultants personal secretary on the 6th April to see if the results from the MRI scan was okay since the follow up tests was cancelled, she looked through my notes and said that my Consultant ""definitely needs to see you and he or myself will be in contact very shortly (by the end of the week), either by phone call or in person to discuss your results"". I was not contacted again and so I called bacn on the 10th, but was greeted by voicemail saying they are out of office until the 20th April...

I am very worried because it has been over a month since my MRI scan and I have still not recieved my results. I am even more concerned now that the lump is much bigger than I originally realised and I am not sure of it has grown recently because it is below the surface of the skin. It has become (within the past 2 weeks) painful and constantly aches.

 The visible lump is 1.5cm in diameter, regular in shape and round. The extension of the mass below the surface is irregular, and approx. 3.5cm x 2.5cm in dimension.

g0rx97,[35][M] Rash on upper thigh and calf. Eczema? Psoriasis?,"35 Male
5'11""
280LBS
White

6 Months post chemo for osteosarcoma, 5 months post op with titanium implant in my left femur.

I've had two rashes on my right leg (non surgical) for the last month. One thigh, one calf. Itchy when I pay attention.

At the two week mark I consulted electronically with pictures and phone call with my oncology PA and nursing staff. Since the rash blanched, was raised and I had a surveillance scan and blood work at the begging of March, they prescribed an ointment, triamcinolone acetonide and said to see my GP after two weeks.

After two weeks the rash in on my thigh got better where the ointment was applied, but migrated down towards my knee. GP is closed, no one will see me since a rash is considered a covid19 symptom. Extremely frustrating. 

The calf rash remain unchanged, but wasn't that bad to begin with.

The bleach burned my scalp which hasnt happened in the 100 times ive bleached my hair in my life. I washed it out and no chemical burns on my scalp and my head isnt burning at all.

I went on a walk with my dogs and i came back and my throat is very scrathy and my nose hurts. I have post nasal drip but my mouth is dry. I also have a mild headache. Its been like 3 hours since i washed my hair out and im a little lightheaded with a sore throat now but not at the initial time.

I first noticed a rash on my forearm about 2 months ago. I had taken a back pain medication a few hours before and thought possibly it contained naproxen- a medication I have had a rash from in the past. Forgot about it for a few weeks. Few weeks later I noticed a similar rash on the back of my hand. It stayed for a few days then started to migrate up my arm. At this point I stopped in to see the doctor just to be safe. Doctor said it was a viral rash and  let me go on my way. Over the next week the rash spread all over my body. Sometimes disappearing in places and reappearing in others. It seems to be warm to the touch. Sometimes it looks red other times it looks like white bumps. I went back to the doctor a week later and again he said it was  viral infection. Gave me antibiotics just in case it did not dissapear by the next week but I had no fever. The day came that the doctor told me to fill the prescription if i was still having symptoms. The rash seemed dormant at this time, still some white bumps but seemed to be improving so I did not fill it. I seemed to go through a cold at this time. Runny nose and tired . Anyway it's about 2 weeks later and the rash has seemed to reappeared on both arms. I am a bit concerned. I also have mark on my back that looks slightly similar but different as well, I've included it in the photos. I do not have a fever. I have made no changes to any products I've used. I've barely left the house for the last month. I did take benadryl one time but it didn't seem to have an effect. The rash is not itchy but I do get a prickly feeling on my body at times.

It only hurts when I try to raise my arm over my head while it is extended. If I rotate my shoulder while the arm is bent, it doesn't hurt/only slightly hurts. In resting positions, it does not hurt. It barely hurts if I use my other arm to move this arm around, even when it's extended.

So I'm wondering if the issue is just pinched muscle/tendon that will just resolve in a few days. I've never had an issue like this before and just wanted to know if it was normal to still feel pain two days after it started for this situation, and if so what is a normal time frame for it to go away.

When I check my head, I can find these white bulbs attached to my hair strands that look like nits but I haven’t been able to find any live bugs. Recently, I’ve also been feeling small bumps on my head especially around the areas that are itching. About a month after I realized that my scalp was itching a lot, I started using lice treatment on and off. I’d apply the shampoo and then use the lice comb, but I was never able to find any bugs on the comb. My head kept itching even after the treatment so I continued using it a few times, but the itching never stopped. I thought that I probably wasn’t thorough enough in combing through my hair or cleaning all my furniture, so maybe that was why I still had it. I then suspected that maybe it was dandruff or something else, but I tried dandruff shampoo and the itching didn’t go away. 

I’ve had lice once before and in the past, I found out I had it by scratching my head and pulling out a bug. When I used the treatment, I also found bugs on the comb. The nits were also a lot more visible on the top of my head, but when I look through my head now, I have to look a bit more thoroughly to find those white bulbs. The itching is really hard to ignore now and I’m still finding the white bulbs in my hair. Is it still possible that this is lice even if I haven’t found any bugs or am I just being paranoid?",3,10,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g0vihi/itchy_scalp_finding_white_bulbs_in_my_hair_is/"")",2020-04-13 17:47:07,Physician Responded

You might've heard that the healthcare here... well, it is not the best. We (me and my classmates (yes, I am in High School) were under inspection organized by the ruling party - 'Edinaya Rossiya' (United Russia). I believe it was... a year ago? or it was in September 2019, I am not really sure. Okay, let's get to the point, I underwent all of the inspections and got... average results. Some were actually good and the only problem was my eyesight, since I have '-3'. After all of the inspections I went to get medical certificate. I was told to wait, so I waited for 30 minutes or so. Once I came back I had a conversation with a woman at the desk (Keep in mind, that she is a qualified doctor):

No medical issues, no allergies, no medications

I have this random rash on my inner forearm that just started two days ago. It hasn’t gotten any worse, but hasn’t improved at all. It does not itch and does not feel uncomfortable at all (I barely even noticed it). I’ve never had a rash like this before. I have noticed though that the general area where it is has moved slightly up my arm. So I guess it is spreading at a very slow rate. Also, I guess something to note, not sure if it is related, but I also randomly have extremely chapped lips. I very rarely get chapped lips, but right now my mouth is relatively painful to open because the corners of my mouth are so chapped and my lips burn. I've been drinking tons of water since these symptoms started and havent seen much improvement. Could this just be a mix of allergies and maybe a dry environment? Any idea on what this rash may be? I dont want to go to a doctor or urgent care unless I have to, so let me know if you have any suggestions.

g0zvsk,Fluoxetine interacting with caffeine and the heart: arrythmias: What does this mean about my heart? Any info about the mechanism of action appreciated!,"Info: 19M, 5'10"", 160 lbs.

Hello everyone,

My question is regarding antidepressants and this particular one (Fluoxetine) interacting with my heart in a really bad way.

I started taking Fluoxetine 10 mg, and before starting I did a quick little taper off of coffee over the course of 3 days. Was kind of aggressive but figured better than nothing.

So I had more or less a clean state when I started taking Fluoxetine.

Ok, so I only took it 3 times. And then on the third day, I started drinking coffee, because I felt like I really needed it.

I started getting terrible arrhythmias (starting that night), and they seemed to get a lot worse with any sort of caffeine intake (green tea, coffee, dark chocolate).

Some of the arrythmia episodes were so bad, I wondered how close I was to a heart attack or some sort of heart failure or something. Was also worried about what was happening after I did manage to fall asleep...

So after that 3rd dose, I decided very quickly that it'd be best to stop taking it.

Ever since, I've been trying to limit coffee and green tea intake, but I'm trying to find the balance, as my depression is very very bad if I don't have any.

Shortly after quitting Prozac, I found out that the half life is 4-6 days, but the 99% elimination period is 25 days! I also found out that the active metabolite (?) has a half life of 3 weeks!

Anywho, the last two weeks have been god awful (and add onto that Corona Quarantine, not exactly conditions conducive to preventing depression).

My question is:

What does this say about my heart?

Did a quick search and found one site saying that this particular reaction (arrythmias) only happens in 1-10% of users, so it's not very common.

Prior to this, my heart showed no signs of being unhealthy.

I think when I was born I had a heart murmur, and then the only sign of heart non-health would be that after pulling really long all nighters a few months ago (for school), I would get like 2-3 arrythmias right before bed, but they would go away after that so I didn't think much of them.

Coincidentally, the arrythmias from Prozac also happen mostly only closer to bed time, and right at bed time. I've noticed eating a lot of food helps the arrythmias kind of go away, enough so I can go to bed.

But the worst arrythmia episode from those all nighters back in college, was not nearly as bad as these episodes. I think the arrythmias from Prozac (combined with coffee) were like maybe 8-10 arrythmias per night, possibly more if including earlier parts of the evening.

I have also realized, for reasons that I won't get into here, that coffee, green tea, and dark chocolate, are not viable solutions moving forward, not even for the short term.

So I'm considering starting adderall or vyvanse, but this whole last episode with Prozac (and a torturously long one, I must say), has got me a little worried if my heart is good enough/strong enough/able to take those.

Also thinking about what other antidepressants, or probably what SSRI's, would not interact like this my heart, for possible future use. If you guys have any suggestions or leads I would appreciate them!

I will get an EKG eventually (still need to schedule it), but before then, was wondering if any of you guys could point me in the right direction of what to look into.

Thanks!

P.S.

What's even more paradoxical about this situation is that (supposedly) Prozac is not supposed to increase chances of arrythmias, despite other SSRI's being found to do so.

From this [Harvard Blog post/Article.](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/antidepressants-and-arrhythmias)

""they confirmed that higher doses of citalopram (Celexa), amitriptyline (Elavil), and escitalopram (Lexapro) were associated with a slight disruption of the electrical function of the heart. This delay as seen on an ECG is known as a prolonged Q-T interval, and it is a risk factor for an arrhythmia that causes sudden death.""

""Instead, such a patient might try one of the antidepressants that do not increase the Q-T interval: fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), or buproprion (Wellbutrin).""",1,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g0zvsk/fluoxetine_interacting_with_caffeine_and_the/"")",2020-04-13 22:48:59,Physician Responded

i have had a hell of a time getting treatment because im not critical enough during this covid19 crap. through multiple urgent care visits i finally got one to take urine and blood samples. they also got me an ultrasound and a telemed appt with a gastroenterologist. 

the urine was normal, but i was slightly dehydrated. not surprising given i was so nauseous drinking water was difficult. blood test was also normal except for a slightly low RBC count/low iron. the ultrasound showed no evidence of gallbladder problem, but did reveal some potential (likely benign) tumors in my liver. those apparently are completely incidental, and not urgent to diagnose immediately, but i do need to get a CT scan on them once covid restrictions lighten up.

this past weekend vomiting returned for a few hours. i also developed a mild fever, and then chills with low body temp. i was also salivating uncontrollably. i had to chew gum to get the salvation to stop. it was weird af. 

i can only eat small portions of easy to digest food. like grapes and cream of wheat. complex foods or larger portions usually throw me into severe nausea/belching/etc. I've lost around 6lbs this far. 

i'm waiting for a h. pylori stool sample test to come back in the next 48hrs. at this point im praying its positive so i can get an answer and some relief.

is this normal? 9 weeks feels really long. every time i think im improving it hits me and gets bad again. do i sound like im describing an ulcer? and if so does it seem like the bacterial type? can it really take this long to heal? i called the gastroenterologist and im trying to get a follow up appt soon. i realize this is the internet and is not a substitute for true medical care. im just having lots of anxiety and would love some opinions. 9 weeks of constant nausea starts to fuck with your head. 

note - I've been on anti nausea and proton pump inhibitors for 4 weeks. i take no other meds including nsaids. there's also no history of cancer/ulcers im my family. im also a middle aged male (early 40s). i have no major health issues, injuries, or surgeries. im an avid fitness freak. seasonal allergies, mild rosacea, and depression are my only real health problems to date.

Well, my left labia minora is missing. As in, there's nothing there to suggest there ever was a left labia minora. The right labia minora is still there and unchanged.

No smoking ever

No drinking ever

Important to note: I went to the gynecologist about five months ago because there was tissue buildup around the opening of my vagina. The gynecologist said it was normal and just my vaginal wall protruding a bit. The issue I have with it is that my vaginal wall had never protruded before that.

g10rer,Small bites appearing on skin?,"(edited to include required info and photos)

Hi there, 26 yo female here. 5'9"" 150 African American. Over the last week I’ve had what I think are small bites turn up on my skin. The first was on my leg, and the rest are around my torso. I’m assuming they’re bites because they always mosquito-bite-like (small, red, itchy) but over time get larger and flatten out. Some stay flat and red, almost scale-y but not quite. There are a few, though, that go flat and red and scale-y, but also have little white head type bumps underneath. Always itchy though. The one on my leg is the largest- about the size of a quarter or a bit bigger, and the rest are about the size of my pinkie nail. I’ve recently changed my sheets since being bitten(?), haven’t changed lotions, used anything different in or outside of the house. I work out outside, but shower immediately after, and I seem to have new ones appear overnight (my partner has taken note of a couple of them that weren’t there before we went to sleep the night before, and he hasn’t been bitten either). I’ve tried googling as detailed as i can and nothing similar pops but, but it might just be because I don’t know what I’m looking for. I’ve asked my roommates who’ve worked outdoors for extended periods of time and one of them said it might be a spider bite. While I believe it could be, it seems strange that it would only bite me, and not the person I sleep next to/on (we sleep very close together, mostly physically touching). I'm on no medications at the moment. I'd say I've been drinking more since quarantine started, but no where near excess, and no recreational drugs to speak of with any type of frequency. Any ideas would be appreciated! I’d just like to know what direction to start looking in. Thanks!

Here are some pictures of a few of them, they dont quite highlight the small ""white heads"" beneath the surface, but hopefully you can still see them.

g11vvu,[HELP] Mom (58) had a heart attack (STEMI) on Sunday night. Confused and very scared.,"On Sunday night, I got a call that my mom (58) was taken to the emergency room after experiencing severe chest pain. She had complained of feeling fatigued to me on the phone about an hour and a half before she was taken by ambulance. Upon arrival it was determined she was having a STEMI heart attack based on an ECG. Approximately 24 hours ago while In the cath lab undergoing a PCI she arrested. She has since been on a ventilator in the cardiac icu.

Monday morning, post arrest/PCI, her troponin was at 8.9 ng/mL. By Monday night troponin had risen to 72.6 ng/mL. Does this indicate severe cardiac damage? I’m having trouble getting all my questions answered due to quarantine regulations at the hospital. Unfortunately I’m unable to be physically present in the cardiac icu due to a cough and mild fever on my end of things. 

I am very concerned about her being on a ventilator as she has early stage COPD (and continues to smoke smh). Also, I watched my grandfather go on a ventilator and never come off of it. It’s very scary stuff for me, as I have no family besides my mom. It’s just me and her. When I last spoke to the charge nurse, I was told that they had tried to lower FiO2 on the ventilator but had to bring her back up to 0.70 FiO2. Her PEEP started at 10 and is now at 15. My understanding is that the high FiO2 and increasing PEEP levels should be cause for concern due to risks with oxygen toxicity and barotrauma? Should I be worried about PEEP increasing and the inability to lower FiO2? I know I probably sound like Dr. WebMD, but I’m just trying to understand so I can better advocate for my mom.

What kind of questions do I need to be asking when I’m talking to the charge nurse and/or doctor on the phone? My grandma had a heart attack at 65 and her health rapidly declined after that. I want to avoid watching my mom decline rapidly over the next few years assuming she makes it out of the ICU. Obviously she needs to quit smoking. She also doesn’t exercise at all aside from walking the dog (although her weight is completely fine she’s 5’6” and 129lbs) and that needs to change. What else do I need to convince her to do to make sure she’s around for as long as possible? I don’t feel remotely ready to be completely alone in the world. Thanks in advance!

g12ds1,33F - its been over a month and pinky is still not healed,"I jammed my pinky finger straight-on the dryer, as in, my finger joints were locked and I jabbed it with some force. I actually didn't hurt too bad after the impact, definitely not enough to think it would still be injured after a week. Mostly its just a minimal pain, but I notice some bruising.

Hi, mostly I'd like to know how useful a teledoc session would be with a neurologist. But here are some details of what is going on. Thanks!

An mri found what my GP described as ""scattered white matter changes"". They want me to see a neurologist, but I live very far from one. I've had various bloodwork done. I have seen the GP, a cardiologist, and a dentist. I wore a holter monitor, did a stress test, a sonogram, etc to rule out cardio issues.

I have been experiencing these symptoms for a long time but hadn't thought too much about them until the last year or so. I don't get much help from my rheumatologist or neurologist when I bring up these symptoms, they each tell me to ask the other. So I am here for guidance and advice. 

I often experience painful, electricity-like sensations in what I assume are nerves as it doesn't feel like joint pain. The pain happens most often in my upper arms and lower legs. Sometimes all the way from my hip to my toes. The most severe is in the back of my neck, where my neck meets my shoulder on the left. That specific one is enough to stop whatever I'm doing gasping, it comes out of nowhere. The pain level can be anywhere from a 2 to an 8, usually around the same amount depending on where in my body it is (like my neck is almost always an 8 where my arms are almost always a 2 or 3). It can last anywhere from 10 seconds to all day. Sometimes it happens every day, sometimes not for months. It definitely happens more when I'm stressed, physically or mentally. 

I have been experiencing brain fog for a long time, but I've always chalked it up to a migraine aura or migraine recovery, as triptan medication is known to cause brain fog. But lately it's been more severe, I am forgetting things all the time. I got out of bed to use the bathroom and went back to bed to realize I forgot to pee the other night. I am forgetting what I wanted to say in the middle of saying it. 

If I am touched in certain places, like my knee, I can also feel it somewhere else, like my hip. I had a wart taken off my knee a few years ago and it tickled me all the way from my ankle to my hip. If my husband touches my lower back I feel it in my ribs. 

I also experience a feeling like bugs crawling on me. Often on my scalp and also on my feet. This symptom kept me awake last night for two or three hours, it's never been that severe before. That's what led me here. 

Any advice will be much appreciated. I was on gabapentin once for the electric pains, but it didn't really help.",1,12,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g19lhy/wondering_about_possible_fibromyalgia/"")",2020-04-14 10:15:07,Physician Responded

g1bt3g,"For the dermatologists: I have a weird, small growth on my scalp","I've (24F) known that this thing has been here since I was at least 15, when I shaved the side of my head in high school. I can't recall if I might have felt it before that but I don't remember. I have a fully buzzed head now and the thing sticks out like a sore thumb. 

It's a tiny growth, maybe a little smaller than a pencil eraser, and hasn't grown since I first noticed it - or at least not as far as I can tell. It moves with my skin if I tug the area around it. It does not cause me any pain; nothing comes out when I squeeze it. It actually feels pretty solid. Not like a pebble or anything but it's not super squishy. I don't anticipate that it's a cyst because I've had them and this one is completely different in every way. It looks like a mole? But is the same colour as my skin, which puzzles me.

Honestly it's never really *bothered* me at all, I'm just curious if anyone has any insight as to what it might be. [Here's a picture](https://imgur.com/a/3RA0thZ) of exactly what it looks like. It's on the left side of my scalp, the image was just rotated counterclockwise in the upload.

g1c1e6,25M Animal Abuse tendencies,"I have recently gotten a pet for the first time in my life. I fostered a cat that is 3 years old 2 weeks ago. I dont know what happens but i suddenly get the urge not harm him but to abuse him as make him very scared.

I would think about trapping him and turning on the vacuum machine which would scare him. Lock him outside the house. Trap him in a plastic bag and suspended from the door knot. Lock him in his cage. 

I keep getting the urge and sadly I acted it on it once or twice. I want to return him to the foster home cause but they closed due up corona outbreak and none of my friends would accept a cat. 

I don't know how to phrase it but I want to stop because i don't feel empathy or petty towards him when I harm or stress him. I even feel pleasure and caught myself taking videos and smiling while I harm him . I just know it is something wrong. I can't get to a psychiatrist because if the lock down and because they are very very very expensive where I love (average cost of 1 hour is $250 and my salary is around $1300)

 I dont want to continue with this because it escalated fairly quickly from annoying him with simple sounds to thought if drowning him. I don't want to know what would happen if I continue.


Edit 1: Because most put me under the pretence that I lived in US,  I would like to clarify than I am an expat working in the Arab gulf region. There are very strict rules send precautions about mental health or at least thats what I was told when I did some research, it might lead to deportation and permensnt ban from the arab gulf (might be wrong can't find a source to confirm nor deny).

I applied ice and some NSAID daily for the first 2 weeks. Those first 2 weeks I had the whole area bruised and some really acute pain on the interior of the thumb (starting from the bottom of the thumb). The swelling has now gone but I still have the same pain

                    Will I have to be submitted to surgery?
   
                    Can I still treat this at home?

Second post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/cyqhyh/update_told_that_the_reason_i_pass_out_when_i/

**Recap/Short Summary**:
When I turn my head laterally I experience symptoms such as lapses of consciousness and blindness in one or both eyes. It seems like episodes are less likely to happen in situations where I am anxious. I'm thinking that has something to do with raised blood pressure. There are more symptoms which I listed out in my second post.

**Since my last post**:

* I had a neurologist that decided I have conversion disorder after he couldn't find anything else wrong

* I decided it was worth it to wait for a top neurologist to see me. That neuro did not think it was psychiatric.

* That neuro decided to send me to a Thoracic Surgeon to test for Thoracic Outlet Syndrome for the 4th time because he said that he knew one person who would perform the test and would produce reliable results since most people don't properly test for it.

These were his thoughts:

&gt; It sounds like a vascular issue to me. Thoracic outlet is certainly in the nix and we will test it by ultrasound 01:12 . If negative, we will do a tilt-table to look for dysautonomia and then finally may look at the cervical occipital instability. She had a flexion and extension MRI that showed some findings, but we may need to get her to see a local neurosurgeon who has an expertise on that. I doubt she is having epilepsy.

* Test for TOS came back positive, meaning 2/4 prelim. tests I have done for TOS have come back positive

* Did more tests

**Diagnosis**:
Suggestive of mild-moderate venous thoracic outlet syndrome on the right and equivocal mild venous thoracic outlet syndrome on the left.

They also found a small hyper enhancing lesion on my liver which they are going to do an MRI of later, but it is most likely just a benign flash-filling hemangioma so I'm not worried about it.

So now that **I have a diagnosis** you may be wondering, **what is the problem?**


#**My diagnosis doesn't fit all my symptoms**

Specifically, my problems with lapses in consciousness. 

I wanted to hear your thoughts on what underlying 2nd condition there may be if there is one.

I recorded some videos where I induce episodes. I accidentally hit my head in two of the videos, but I didn't know that I did until I watched the videos. I also had some memory loss of immediately before and after each episode. 

Note that these episodes are what I was classify as mild-moderate. I frequently have more severe ones but they only really get severe when they catch me off guard.

In each video you will note there is a lag between when I turn my head and the visible symptoms occur. During this time frame one or both eyes are going blind, either partially or fully.

I am coming to here today because I am concerned that I have no idea if it has potential to be digested by my stomach or if I am just going to poop it out still even tho it has been 5 days since it happened.

Unfortunately I'm away from my son at the moment so I cant get a better image

Male, 0 years (3 weeks) 10lb 8oz. No current medical problems a previous of Jaundice

Ok so I'm in a huge predicament at the moment. My 3 week old son is currently in hospital as my partner fell over onto the sofa with baby in his arms and slightly squashed him. I didn't witness any of this as I was in the next room asleep. Medically he is fit and well but in hospital mainly for safeguarding due to the bruises this left on his arms. It's effing awful being looked at like you're a potential child abuser but I understand the procedures to protect minors. 

Now even to me as someone who isn't medically trained remotely - these bruises look strange and not correlating to a fall. Even the paeds who examined my son were baffled a little. It also doesn't look like something someone could directly inflict. 

It's the same on both arms with linear bruising in skin creases and some bruise spots. 

Can I get an opinion on what the f this could be? I have a feeling it's from being swaddled too tight or the swaddle being forced tight in frustration. I'm going to be having a serious convo with my partner when he returns home. I don't want to go throwing accusations either. But at the same time why would he lie? Nothing adds up

I'm not getting into domestics this is docs not relationshipadvice. 

My son is safe and in the care of many nurses and pediatricians currently. 

I just want an opinion on what this could be? Of course I'm taking doctors at the hospital's words first but I'm so distressed.

g1fzwy,Prolapse and Vaginal Laxity. Will surgeries make me normal?," 

23F. I was obese for many years and on top of that i had/have chronic coughing because of bronchitis. my whole pelvic floor has been very weakened because of this. I cant stop pee mid peeing. pee comes out throughout the day so i always have to wear a pad, especially when going out. I cant have sex since i have extreme laxity in my vagina. I started using larger and larger sex toys because i couldnt feel any friction, and it stretched my vagina tissue even more. I can at any time when im not even aroused insert 3-4 fingers without much resistance. i cant feel my muscles very well, and i cant grip my fingers while squeezing almost no matter how many fingers i use. it feels like there is literally no tissue left to be stretched. It's like it's been streched as much it can. same with the muscles. they are so streched and weak. I am pretty sure i have Cystocele (Bladder prolapse) and Rectocele (Rectum prolapse) as i can feel them bulge into the vagina most times because of the stretched tissue and muscles. I feel extremely insecure about this. I do a lot of kegel exercises every day and have been doing them since i was 16. I know i will need surgery for this and probably multiple. i will need vaginoplasty to tighten up my vagina and to also fix prolapse. I will also need Sphincteroplasty to tighten the rectum sphincter muscles as they are also weak. Will these surgeries be able to make my vagina normal again even tho it's so damaged? I can't imagine it being able to return me to my original tightness. Have any of you experienced something like this to this extreme and what did you do and what were the results?",2,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g1fzwy/prolapse_and_vaginal_laxity_will_surgeries_make/"")",2020-04-14 16:03:46,Physician Responded
g1g0v6,"When should I, 26F, expect my bowel movements to return back to normal after my appendectomy?","I had an appendectomy two days ago.

Only today have I started having small farts. Lots of burping, but the farts are very small, which is annoying because I have the feeling where I need to pass gas but nothing satisfying enough happens. Before the appendectomy I was someone who didn't fart very much and was more on the constipated side, so I'm not surprised.

Anyways, when should I expect things to go back to normal? I haven't had a bowel movement yet (unless urinating counts?). Should I be eating a high fibre diet right now, or a more soft foods diet?

I would like to use a suppository to help, but I feel like after 2 days it's a bit too soon and I don't want to aggravate the area. When is it safe to use a suppository? Is a liquid glycerin suppository safe to use at all in the next few days?

g1gg6s,Is it a good idea to take the antibiotic treatment for h pylori? Sorry for tmi.,"So about a year and a half ago I took an antibiotic and my stools have never been the same again. My diet slowly became more and more restricted, and I’m down to a very bland one now. Shortly after that antibiotic, I noticed that I’d see undigested food particles in my stool all the time. As well as mucus. 

 This is where h pylori ties in. I’ve been tested for it through the stool and it came back positive. I knew I had it way before that antibiotic. I took that medicine on an empty stomach every time which is why I think it hurt me so bad. But h pylori has always been there, maybe I killed everything else in the stomach and allowed it to overgrow way past what it was? 

I don’t have awful heartburn, but I do have it sometimes when I’m burping. As well as minor pains in the stomach area. My worst stomach symptom is that I can feel/burp my food up hours after I’ve eaten. And I mean like 4-5 hours. Like it’s just sitting there. Possibly due to lack of stomach acid from h pylori overgrowth? Sometimes when I burp I feel some food try to come up. And I just recently began to have awful nausea anytime I try to eat which is why I tested for it again. Go figure. Positive. 

So my questions are. 

1. Does this sound like it’s being caused by h pylori? 

2. Is it a good idea to take the antibiotics since an antibiotic was what put me here. 



Symptoms: Nausea, little heartburn, burping hours after eating, food sitting in stomach forever!!!, crazy bowel patterns, weight loss, minor pain where stomach/gallbladder is.

I tend to get like one a day during the periods of time when it happens. My heartburn can be gone for a while and I'll still have the irritated throat and the mucus balls. I have attached photos of my throat and photos of the mucus balls.

One untrustworthy doctor said I had a throat infection - no tests, just visually looked and prescribed me antibiotics, take this doctor's opinion with a grain of salt. I went to another doctor, more trustworthy and they did not see any throat infection and just told me to go to a specialist. I really doubt I have a throat infection but I am wondering what the hell it is.

Dx: fibromyalgia, vitamin D deficiency, mild b12 deficiency, hashimotos, chronic rhinitis, herpes simplex 1 w/ a hx of nasal outbreaks. 
Meds: Tylenol or ibuprofen as needed for pain. Vitamin D (4000IU/day), B12(1000/day) 

Current issue: my nose has been feeling dry and stuffy and irritated. Keeps getting crusty scab/booger feeling with occasional scabs or blood when I blow it, all mucous when any does come out is clear. The right nostril is sore. It’s been itchy the last couple days so I finally had a look up there to see if maybe it’s actually a cold sore (happens more frequently than I’d like) but all I see is this [white spot ](https://imgur.com/a/yfANASt) what is it? It also is white further up into the crease but I couldn’t bend my nose up to get a photo of that haha. 
1)Is this an area healing, or is white spots like this normal? I looked in the other nostril and it doesn’t have any white areas like this just looks like my normal red inflamed passages. 
It caught me off guard bc it seems like the wrong color to be inside my nose haha. 
2)Any advice about what I can do to encourage healing? I’ve been using saline spray the last couple days.

g1k55k,Foot dryness,"Male 26, 270 lbs.

I have IBS and lactose intolerant and severe allergies. I have dealt with dryness in both feet for close to 6 years. I coat my feet in lotion and wear socks when I sleep and it helps but it gets old. My doctor has no clue and doesn’t seem to want to refer me. I have also tried tea tree oil with little success. Really looking for other options. It does not hurt and I can pick at it without it hurting. It’s just annoying as I leave dry feet crap if I go without socks.

It has now returned, though not as big as when I found it the first time. Same spot, red patch on skin, possibly a bit harder/less soft than I recall. About me: 25 year old male. Quite overweight, but don’t smoke or drink.

g1mjxh,Help with Cymbalta withdrawals,"So I had been on Cymbalta for 2-3 years at 60 mg. I’m a 23 year old female. I was aware of the withdrawal symptoms, as any time I would forget to take a dose, I’d feel the withdrawal symptoms with hours. I’ve also been on multiple other antidepressants and have had withdrawal symptoms from them as well, so I expected Cymbalta to be the same. 

I was on it for depression and anxiety but for a few reasons, I had decided to wean myself off of it with the help of my PCP. My PCP recommended that I go from 60 to 50 mg for 1 month, then 50 to 40 mg for 1 month, 40 to 30 mg for 1 month, 30 to 20 mg for 1 month, and then 20 mg every other day, and then every other two days, and then eventually stop. So last Wednesday, I took my last pill. And since then, I’ve been experiencing withdrawal symptoms and it just sucks.

The main on being this weird sensation in my head (mainly when I look around/move my eyes but also sometimes occurs randomly), which sometimes leads to a migraine and nausea. From what I read, this seems to be what they call “brain zaps,” however, I wouldn’t really consider the sensation to feel “electrical” but everyone’s different. I’d say the first few days were the worst, but for the last couple of days, the symptoms seems to just remain constant instead of improving. On the 4th day, I started experiencing crazy mood swings. I started crying because I was feeling sweaty (I don’t know, okay, it was weird), then I started laughing at myself, and then started crying again, and it was a ridiculous emotional roller coaster for about 20 mins. I get very agitated and irritable. 

Like I said though, the main symptoms bothering me are the brain zaps, and then the migraines and nausea that comes afterward sometimes. Is there anything that anyone has tried that seems to have helped get them through the withdrawal? I’ve tried drinking lots of water to help detox more. But I don’t know what else to try really and thought maybe some of you could help. I really appreciate any suggestions! (Except for the use of any drugs, alcohol, etc.) I’m just struggling because with other antidepressants, after a week without the meds, withdrawal symptoms usually are gone by then, but this seems to be staying constant and I don’t know how much longer this will last, which is stressing me out. Are there any otc medications I can take? Any prescriptions I can ask my doctor for, that wouldn’t lead to dependence as well? Any certain foods?

g1mk0z,Non-emergency care in these times [ADHD],"26F, no meds, no drugs, living in the USA

Recently (just over 1 month ago) I was diagnosed with ADHD by a clinical psychologist (combination of history, IVA-2, and WAIS). We discussed behavioral interventions and management through medication, and I left the conversation kind of on the fence about trying meds. At the time, I wasn't really struggling that much and I felt like I could mostly manage with a few new organizational strategies—but that being said, I've been struggling with my issues for *years* and so I've tried almost every organizational tool under the sun. So I knew I'd get limited benefit from behavioral interventions alone, but I didn't feel there was much urgency to do something about it.

Enter COVID. My PhD program went remote and, though I'm lucky to still have income coming in, losing that structure and regular social interaction has been *really hard.* Like, usually-forget-to-eat-until-7pm hard, haven't-been-outside-in-4-days hard, still-haven't-started-tasks-I-thought-I'd-finish-two-weeks-ago hard. Given where I am now, I'm pretty sure I'd benefit from medication.

There are a few obstacles in my way:

* At the end of last year I switched insurance providers, which means I need to find another Primary Care Provider
* I'm under a shelter-in-place order and I live with someone who is at increased risk, so I'm trying to protect him and myself as much as possible
* This is obviously not an emergency and I worry about taking away resources from someone in much greater need

My initial plan was to wait it out and find a PCP after the shelter-in-place lifts. But that might not be until 2021. My biggest fear is losing funding because of this—I'm already a year ""behind"" before all this. So far I've been hesitant to ask for accommodations because it's all so new and I don't even know what might help me, but I'll definitely be exploring this option if I need to.

So, at last, my question: what should I do?

* Is it true that I'm taking away resources if I try to see/find a PCP for this relatively minor, non-life-threatening condition?
* What are my options here? Is there a way I can see a doctor safely? Is non-emergency telemedicine happening for issues like these? Can I be seen virtually if I'm a new patient?

**TLDR: recently diagnosed with ADHD but stuck/struggling because of circumstances around coronavirus. I'd like to try medication, but I have no PCP currently and I live with a vulnerable person.

No itching, dryness, redness or any other symptoms besides the split skin. Dr prescribed Lamisil and it was gone in about a week with 2x day application for the full prescribed time. 

This winter I had the same symptoms, Lamisil again solved that problem. However this time, my lower legs between my ankle and half way up my leg to my knee, where your average “crew” socks cover, has been extremely itchy, usually worse in the evenings. There is no redness or visible signs of anything wrong other than the itching.  I thought it was just dry skin and tried several skin lotions that have worked well for me in the past to no avail. When reading up on tinea pedis, I saw that sometimes it can transfer to other areas of the body via pulling on clothes, like underwear, over the feet. 

Is it possible that a similar thing happened and it has transferred to my shins and lower calf?  I don’t see much mention of athlete’s foot on anything other than feet elsewhere. .

g1pie3,20F is this fungus on my feet?,"https://ibb.co/XCJQMSW

20/female/white. 170 cm, about 53/55 kg. Occasional drinker, rarely a smoker. No preexisting skin condition/allergy that I know of.

For as long as I can remember I jave had a bit of dead excess skin on my feet which I could never get rid of. My feet have also always sweat quite a lot so from time to time they would burn a bit. However recently the burning sensation has become UNBEARABLE. A few months ago 2/3 white warts appeared on the right big toe. Also some skin redness appeared however I didn't really think much of it. There wasn't any skin coming off, neither on the foot or inbetween toes (that's why I didn't think it was fungus). I took several vinegar baths in warm water which helped lessen the burning sensation. It also caused some skin to start falling off/exacerbated the warts (they were obscured by dead skin I guess...).

g1r3p1,Nail bed question - don't want to go to GP if can help it.,"https://imgur.com/a/Qsq9GZv

Hi, Male, 22, Australia, think that should do. 

About a week ago I smacked my thumb with a hammer while working on my fence. Today only part of the bottom of the nail started to fall off. Lucky it was dead so it didn't hurt, problem is I now have what looks like a giant hole in my nail. No other part of my nail seems to be dead, and the part on the left snags on everything and hurts like hell. 

Will this heal naturally or will I need to have the nail removed?

Bonus points if you can tell me what the hell that bubble thing is too, soft fluffy and hurts, seems to only weep but not be filled with anything else.

g1r7p0,"Paralysis in arms, nausea, numbness in body","Hello guys. 
To keep things brief in this horrifying event for me, I'll start by saying I recently took on my first job at FedEx Ground as a package handler. My personal background consists mainly of programming and other computer related activities and I've never been much of one to move around throughout the day. While I'm 6'3 @ 160lbs, I have fairly low muscle mass and these first 3 days have been very physically demanding on the jobs. Muscle fatigue is intense. So anyways, my diet has been exceedingly poor as of recently. Averaging one meal per day around 800 calories with a couple of beverages before and after, I likely haven't been consuming a sufficient amount of caloric values which I'm sure contributes to my condition. With that information in mind, now I'll get to the point. 
Lastnight, Tuesday 14, I reported to work as usual and click my 4 hours. I felt pretty exhausted from the start so I felt that it was a great time to utilize the same tool everybody else does to gain that slight edge on energy and consumed two Bang energy drinks (300mg caffeine per). At first, I felt slightly nauseous and anxious but that usually follows anytime I consume caffeine. 
After about the 2 hour mark of my shift, I began to feel incredibly winded and burnt out. Almost as if I had next to no energy and I found myself stopping to catch my breath every 2 minutes or so, trying to prevent a collapse altogether. This went on throughout my shift and it continues to worsen until we reaches the last trailer. Now I'm not one to usually wear short sleeves as I'm insecure about my arms so I'm dressed in an unreasonably thick cotton shirt like an idiot which insulates a lot of body heat. Through my shift I had felt hot but during the last trailer, my body was still very hot to the touch (witnessed by a coworker as well) but I began to shiver, a lot. 
Eventually it was time to clock out and head home. So I went up to the security post to wait for my fathers arrival and took a seat in the private telephone room. After about 5 minutes, I began to shake intensely and nausea hit like a tsunami to the point I couldn't keep my head upright without the aid of my arms. 15 minutes later of nausea and my father arrived. I walked out to the car, boarded and notified him that I was feeling terrible and we drove out of the parking lot. Roughly a minute of two of our departure, breathing became very, very difficult and it felt as if I was severely lacking oxygen through every breath. He immediately noted my heavy breathing in which I explained that I might need to go to the hospital as I was on the verge of passing out. And suddenly once we reached the on ramp to the interstate, my tongue, jaw, lower stomach and legs started to feel a numb sensation that made it a little difficult to speak or sit upright. Around 2 minutes passed and my arms and hands went completely numb to the point I couldnt feel or move them in even the slightest, and then the part that frightens me most took place. The muscles in my arms contracted so tight to the point they curled up into a chicken-wing shape and I physically couldn't unfold my arms, open my hands or even move them away from my chest. The pain from the muscle contraction was so intense, my forearms are incredibly sore to the point it's difficult to type. 
I'm not sure if it's relevant to note, but I've been having, what appears to be on paper, blood circulation problems. As my limbs almost immediately go numb after resting on an object or elevating it above the normal operating height. I also have a very cold sensation at the back of my throat which makes me feel nauseous from time to time. 
I've only ever had a few panic attacks in my life but I do suffer from anxiety problems daily. Could this be a result of that or yet another panic attack followed by malnourishment and exhaustion or something more serious such as a stroke? I'm very scared at this point and I'm in hope that somebody here can provide me an answer before I go see a professional.

g1wne6,"Ibuprofen, Blood Thinners, or Muscle Relaxers as an Option for Bipolar2 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder?","TLDR at the bottom. Hello I am a white 30(F) diagnosed Bipolar2 with Generalized Anxiety Disorder as a co-morbid condition. Located in the United States, 5'4"", 150lbs, Bipolar disorder onset at 18 years old, diagnosed 3 years ago. Taking 150mg Lamicatal and 225mg Wellbutrin. I exercise 4-5 times a week so that is not a recommendation that will help me. 

I have an appointment with my medication doctor on Friday and I wanted to get input on the below question. I don't want to come off as drug seeking. I've never done illegal drugs or taken prescription meds off label, I quit drinking a few years ago when I realized it triggered depressive episodes (and because the Wellbutrin has such as strong warning about alcohol). 

My question is are things like Ibuprofen, Blood Thinners, or Muscle Relaxers ever prescribed for Bipolar Disorder or Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and will it be a red flag to my doctor if I ask about it? 

I mentioned above I have never abused drugs, but I did have a period in my early twenties where I took Excedrin Migraine on an almost daily basis because it alleviated my depressive symptoms. I lived alone at the time and did not have many close friends so I didn't realize I was depressed, I just knew if I took two Excedrin in the morning it massively elevated my mood and concentration long enough to get through the work day. Even though I wasn't taking more than the recommended dosage I eventually realized it was probably bad for my liver/stomach that I took it so often so I stopped. I don't have the urge to abuse it anymore, but my husband keeps the bottle of Excedrin hidden from me just to eliminate the chance. I have also been on muscle relaxants for a short time (maybe a week) in college when I threw out my back and they had a similar effect. Advil has a similar although less effective effect on my mood and concentration as the Excedrin, and I will occasionally allow myself to take Advil if I'm feeling brain foggy. I probably only take Advil in this way 1-2 times a month, I'm cautious because I know I could easily develop a habit.  

I've seen several articles posted on Reddit about studies that show things like Ibuprofen increase blood flow in the brain help with depression and anxiety. I did not read these studies and do not know their legitimacy, but based on my own experiences I would say there is definitely a correlation for me. 

I know anxiety can cause inflammation which in turn would restrict blood flow, which is why things like aspirin, ibuprofen, and muscle relaxers help me. Is there any way I would be prescribed a blood thinner or something similar to help with the inflammation, and therefore help with the depression and concentration issues? My biggest problem right now is concentration and motivation to get things done. I of course fluctuate and do not have this problem when hypomanic, but I am more often not in that state and have difficulties performing at work and being a good partner at home. I am definitely high functioning, but it does still affect my life negatively and I am worried that long term it is going to cause the unraveling of my relationship with my husband and prevent me from having a fulfilling career. 

Edit-Added: I wanted to add that I am asking about alternatives to anti depressants because I've already had to step up my Wellbutrin does several times. It works for while and then loses it's effectiveness, my doctor said it is possible this will continue to happen and when I hit max dose I'll have to stop taking it if it doesn't work anymore. I also know that anti depressants can affect sex drive which is already a huge issue for, so I really want to avoid anything that would make that worse (because it has always been terrible, my husband married me anyway and knows about all my issues, but I would very much like to be a better partner).

TLDR: Are the medications listed in the titles ever prescribed for Bipolar2 and Anxiety Disorder and will asking my medication doctor about it put up red flags? I ask because I know through experience that these types of medications help my mood and concentration tremendously.",5,6,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g1wne6/ibuprofen_blood_thinners_or_muscle_relaxers_as_an/"")",2020-04-15 10:36:51,Physician Responded
g1xesg,Skin rash,"Hello, 36 year old female here with PMH of hypothyroidism (no longer taking levothyroxine; thyroid function has remained WNL- last assessed in January), depression, anxiety, OCD, and post concussion syndrome secondary to head injuries sustained 7/2019 and 9/2019. Of note, following my first head injury in July 2019, I suffered from significantly reduced appetite and rapid weight loss. I would go nearly a week at a time with no PO intake other than sugar free Gatorade; my weight dropped from 150 pounds to 99 lbs in less than 6 weeks. I was certainly nutritionally compromised to some degree. I got into a habit of eating what sounded good just to get some calories in me; this was typically a candy bar, high in sugar and fat. 

My hands have become extremely dry and have cracked open in the winter for as long as I can remember and I suppose this may be where my current issue started. This past winter was particularly severe: the cracking was deep and extremely painful, the worst it’s ever been. I noticed thick layers of hardened skin would build up around the fissures and interfere with healing; this is not something I’ve experienced during previous winters. I struggled with managing the breached skin integrity; nothing seemed to help. I eventually tried application of tea tree oil after which the areas healed within a day, only to reappear in a week or so. Tea tree oil has not proven effective since then. 

I began to suffer from what I believed was malassezia overgrowth/folliculitis, AKA “fungal acne” - tiny flesh-colored or red bumps that had a white center but would not “pop” (for lack of a better word) on my face in the t-zone area. It actually started in December after I tried a new product containing rose oil; I had a terrible rash all over my nose. I soon found the problem was exacerbated by use of products containing typical offending chemicals, as listed on many websites dedicated to the subject (fatty acids, esters, etc). Unfortunately I also suffer from dermatillomania/chronic skin picking secondary to my OCD: a recipe for disaster in combination with any kind of skin problems. I ended up with areas on my face and chest with multiple lesions that resembled large craters, many of which have remained unhealed for weeks to months. The other curious finding which has persisted is a discoloration of my hands (and legs and feet, to a lesser degree) which worsens at times. The knuckles and other random, patchy areas become deep purple, the rest of the skin a yellow hue; when slight pressure is applied to the purple, the area blanches and capillary refill is prolonged &gt; 5 seconds. My toes are cold, blue, and painful at times, similar to some kind of circulation disorder, with which I’ve never been diagnosed. 

Fast forward to current day- I’ve put on weight and am up to 125 pounds which seems to be fairly healthy at my height of 5’3”.  The deep cracking of my hands which came along with the winter cold has improved, although I have minor cracking to my knuckles and two large, deep cracks to my hands which are surrounded by the thick, hardened skin build-up (will attempt to provide photos). My facial skin began to improve after I started using only fungal acne safe products, but I am still struggling with intermittent flare-ups of the skin lesions and other (probably related) issues.

Over the past two months, I noticed my face appearing quite swollen; I also noted intermittent swelling of my hands. The facial edema is approximately + 1 and is pitting at times. My abdomen is constantly bloated, distended, and hard, making me look pregnant (I’m not), and my clothing hasn’t been fitting properly. Several times a day, my hands will turn bright red, and as I watch the blood vessels on the dorsal surface dilate and become visibly engorged, and my hands begin to visibly swell to the point where sometimes the skin splits open. I have finally linked these issues to an offending substance - synthetic fabric. I react to polyester, nylon, rayon, cashmere, and wool. Pretty much anything other than 100% cotton causes a reaction and it is basically instantaneous. It has progressed to the point where I am no longer able to wear clothing items that have even a small percentage of the synthetic fabrics. I feel a sensation that I can only describe as my skin crawling, and I feel a tickling and itching all over my body if polyester so much as touches a small area of my skin. The sensations are often most intense at the site of any existing lesions on my face or chest. I also feel these crawling sensations at other times, such as after a shower. I am using only Cetaphil to clean my face and body, as I have developed intolerances to nearly every skin product in existence. The sensation has begun to feel sharp and “prickly” - like a cactus under my skin causing itching in my face and back. I occasionally feel fluttering tickles near my eyes like something is moving under the skin there as well (no, it’s not Delusions of Parasitosis no matter what it sounds like)! My inner nostrils are raw and sore (this is clearly exacerbated by exposure to synthetic fabrics as they can go from healed to sore within a minute). My face swells quickly and suddenly, along with the soft tissues of my neck, to the point I can barely flex my neck forward to look down and I feel tightness/constriction upon my airway. I also experience mild shortness of breath and sometimes chest pain or epigastric pain when I am doing my childrens’ laundry and am exposed to synthetic fabrics. I also develop bloating and abdominal distention. I have had to remove nearly all clothing from my closet and am wearing only 100% cotton or 95 cotton / 5 spandex. 

As if this were not bad enough, a few weeks ago I began to develop new sensitivities to make up, products which previously did not bother me. I develop a papular rash if anything I’m sensitive to (fabric, makeup) touches my face, and blisters and cracking upon my lips if lipstick is worn (even malassezia safe products). Of course the rash becomes so much worse when I can’t leave it alone; prior to squeezing, the rash on my chin looked like tiny whiteheads but turned into large open sores. I currently have a rash between my breasts consisting of red lesions, some as large as a pencil eraser, with sunken in yellow-white bases at the  centers. The lesions will heal partially overnight when I sleep, but seem to open up again after I shower or use any kind of lotion or antifungal  product. I have included pictures; it’s horrible I know. 

Most recently, I was sorting through some cheap old jewelry when suddenly my hands begin to react and I had shortness of breath and the GI symptoms. I ran to the bathroom and saw my ears were bright red. I took out the earrings that I have been wearing quite some time without incident. I refrained from wearing jewelry for a few weeks but am now wearing a pair in each of my two lobe piercings. I have never had any intolerances to foods, metals, fabrics, or otherwise; only mild seasonal allergies. I know it is not unusual for someone my age to develop new onset allergies, but it seems odd to me that I would develop intolerances so quickly. My quality of life has been greatly diminished. I can no longer sit on my couches or use my blankets. It is nearly impossible for me to avoid touching things I am sensitive to throughout the day (I’m a mom of 2 with a lot of laundry) so I spend the majority of my time with my skin crawling, my face puffed up like a balloon, and my hands dry, split open, and terribly painful. I’ve had great difficulty finding a hand lotion I am able to tolerate. One day in the shower I realized my hands were crusted and scaly, so I began to scrape at them. I scraped off a great deal of dead skin, and after that I developed a crosshatch-like rash on my wrists and more deep fissures in my hands. The rash on my wrists now comes and goes randomly and appears more like an allergic rash (see photos). One interesting thing is that whatever it is that is causing the rash seems to react when one of the lesions is poked or prodded. For example, if I squeeze a lesion on my chest or face, the crawling sensations will begin, and a small pimple may appear elsewhere, such as on my lower leg or abdomen. When I scrape the white part of a lesion off, it bleeds quite a bit (reminds me of thrush, although I have no signs of thrush and no signs of a vaginal yeast infection). The rash burns, and within the last few days I’ve developed angular chelitis at the corners of my mouth bilaterally. While I initially believed the lesions were secondary to malassezia folliculitis, I am now starting to think it may be Candida, or a combination of both, which perhaps became pathogenic after entering through the cracks in my hands.
	

The only reason I haven’t been to the doctor is the pandemic, so I continue to suffer and attempt to treat myself at home. I am taking OTC ceterizine daily, adding loratadine when I’m super miserable and Benadryl PRN only when symptoms are very severe. I have changed to 7th Generation Free &amp; Clear laundry detergents. I am using or have used the following with varying degrees of success: miconazole topical spray, tolnaftate topical spray, Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, Indian Healing clay masks, apple cider vinegar, garlic paste applied topically, Epsom salt baths, Nizoral 1% (was effective in clearing lesions but no longer is), clove essential oil from Young Living (very effective with first application, no longer effective), lavender essential oil from YL, topical itraconozole cream, hydrocortisone cream, hydrogen peroxide, 70% rubbing alcohol, plain yogurt application to rash. I haven’t been able to find a clotrimazole cream without malassezia triggering ingredients. This has progressively worsened since October. I often think I can’t take much more before I break. I would not wish this on anyone. I spend hours every day dealing with the troubling symptoms and have serious anxiety and mental anguish over it. My skin is so terribly hideous; I look diseased. I refuse to let my partner see my chest because of the ugly contagious looking rash. I love makeup and fashion, and can no longer enjoy either. I’m truly at the end of my rope. Can anyone help me? What is this?? How can I get rid of it? Do I need an oral antifungal?  Please - I’m desperate! :(

This is my first time posting and I’m not seeing a way to add photos. I’ll keep trying to add them.

g1ymtf,24F Bloody Cyst-like bump on head for 2+ weeks,"I noticed the bump on my head a little over 2 weeks ago. I initially thought it was a pimple and didn’t pay much attention.

Today (Wednesday) I was washing my hair and hit it hard and it bled for over an hour. I know there is a lot of vascularization on the head but this bled more than I would have expected. Blood completely covered the washcloth I was using to put pressure on it. There is also a little “bump” inside. My first thought is that it’s some type of cyst (especially with the ball like bump inside). It is like a little blister that won’t go away. I would normally go to a dermatologist but they are closed and considering the lockdown that may not be smart. So I’m asking if this looks like something I should get treated or just leave it alone and let it heal on it’s own.

**Photo of my skin** [**here**](https://ibb.co/8cLPJ5v)**.**

Diagnoses: My PCP diagnosed me with scabies and was prescribed permethrin 5%, two treatments a week apart along hydroxyzine 25mg at nights . No improvements were shown. I was referred to dermatologist, got skin biopsy and he diagnosed me with ""Papular Urticaria"" due to possible insect bite and I was prescribed a burst of prednisone 60mg for 4 days with 10 day taper. Rash resolved while on treatment but reappeared during the last 3 doses of treatment. The relapse was much worse. Finally, I visited and allergist and since scabies treatment has been already used he suggests fungal infection (did not mention what kind) and prescribed me Fluconazole 200mg once a week for 4 weeks. I have not seen much improvement. Blood lab work did not revealed significant infection, normal C-reactive protein, abnormal complement CH50 &gt;60H [u/mL](https://www.reddit.com/u/mL/) (C1, C3, C4 normal but C2 serum was low 1.4 (L) from a normal range 1.6-3.5). Normal complete blood count (CBC).

Skin Biopsy: The specimen is characterized by a superficial and deep wedge shaped perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes admixed with few neutrophils and eosinophils. Eosinophils also sparsely scattered in the reticular dermis. Spongiosis and edema of papillary dermis are absent.

My theories: I visited Mexico late January and rash appeared two weeks after arriving to the US. I suspected insect bites or allergic reaction but rash does not respond well to OTC meds for allergy nor hydrocortisone. I am also suspecting urticaria vasculitis since I have been mentioned I might have Sjögren syndrome since I have chronic dry eyes but might be as well dehydration.

high blood pressure

For the past month, I've had a rash on both of my arms, around the back of head, on neck, and on face. Skin is also very dried out and itchy. Occasionally feel irritation in my finger joints, lower lip, and eyes.

Rash on arm:
https://i.imgur.com/A5xfjCl.jpg

Did a virtual visit with my doctor who said she wishes she'd been able to check it out in person and do blood test etc, but due to the current pandemic, that won't be able to happen for a while.

She was going to have me take a different bp medicine for a week to see if things would improve. She prescribed metropolol 25mg which is a beta blocker. She didn't prescribe any other class since lisinopril gave me a bad cough and hydrochlorothiazide caused me to bruise constantly.

Other than this rash, my blood pressure has been well controlled on this ARB. As I understand it, metropolol wouldn't be a very good medicine standalone and would be hard to get off once i'm on it. Also don't want to discover that its not the losartan causing my allergy and then all of a sudden I can't go off of metropolol because of its heart rate changing effects.

My question is, if I'm indeed allergic to losartan, are there other medicines in the ARB class that wouldn't also trigger an allergy? The more I read about these beta blockers, the more it looks like they might be an issue.

Any advice on how to approach this with my doctor would be appreciated. Thanks.",1,7,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g203or/red_dry_rash_losartan_allergy_alternative_bp_meds/"")",2020-04-15 13:31:04,Physician Responded

HDL Cholesterol - 59  
LDL (Calculated) - 163  
Triglycerides - 210

I was finally able to meet with my physician by video today after a several pandemic-caused rescheduled appointments. I asked her whether I should be on statins and she said that there's not a lot of data that supports use of statins for women my age and she wouldn't prescribe it unless my LDL was &gt;180.

I do exercise regularly. I jog 3-4 miles three days a week and I like to run a lot of my errands on foot, so I walk a ton. My diet definitely needs improvement.

It doesn't feel like a blister, but the growth isn't hard. The smaller bumps surrounding it are hard though, and almost black. Small bumps have also started presenting on my other pinky toe but have no large one and are painless. Is this something I need to worry about? It is much darker than it presents in the photo.

g22q8e,Would a fractured bone hurt more as time goes on?,"Earlier this evening my dog pulled me over on concrete. I grazed one knee and cracked the other. The moment I felt the crack I thought I might have fractured something....but I stood up and realised I could put weight on it. I stood around for most of the dog walk and it didnt hurt too bad. When walking home it kinda ached. 

But an hour after doing the injury the pain ramped up, I've got a bruise that is spreading and it's got a swollen bump. I can no longer put my weight on it without an 8/10 pain. As the evenings gone on the pain is getting worse and it feels like its locking up. 

Would a bone fracture have a slight delayed onset of severe pain?

I had a normal abdominal CT scan in Dec 2018 and June 2019 but it wasn't looking for bowel stuff. 

My doctor refuses to refer me for an urgent colonoscopy despite the fact that for six months I have had severe abdominal pain, feelings of not emptying my colon, bloody stools, alternating diarrhea and constipation, and thin/mucousy stools and weight loss (lost 30 lbs without trying when I normal have a hard time losing weight). I am in a small town in Canada so the wait to for a colonoscopy unless urgent is 18 months right now and there's only one GI doctor in a 300 km radius so I can't just go pay for one or get a second opinion though I've thought about driving down to the states I can't do that right now with everything going on.

Basically my doctor did a CRP test which was ""extremely"" high as well as a fecal calprotectin which he said came back negative. He said a negative FC means I definitely don't have IBD or colon cancer. But today I called the lab and got them to send me the results directly and it turns out my FC isn't negative it's 65 which I've read is right around what people with colon cancer get. I'm asking you fine folks what can I do to convince my doctor to give me a colonoscopy sooner than a year from now? My next appointment with him is next week but after that I won't see him for six months. I'm terrified and and my wits end. My grandma died of CC at 55. I'm worried if I have to wait another 18 months I won't be around or will be in a much worse off state.

g24fv3,"24M, Persistent Hip Pain","24M/5’9” 170lbs/Caucasian/hip pain on and off for 2 weeks/occasional alcohol use 

Recently started working a job that requires me to walk around 10km collectively per day. It’s temporary contract work that runs for around 6 months. I’ve done two prior stints at this job and have never experienced any pain. I’m very physically fit and have a history of distance running. 

Based off of hip diagrams, the pain feels like it has to do with my right femur head. I only start to feel it around 2-3 hours into my work day. It hurts more when I’m walking on an incline. 

In the first week I noticed it, it got to around a 7/10 and caused me to walk with a partial limp. I was then briefly laid off due to COVID-19 for 1 week. I went out for a few 30-60 min. walks, and noticed nothing. I also did a pretty rigorous kettlebell workout during that week involving a fair amount of squatting, and still noticed nothing. 

However, after returning from the 1 week lay-off, I have started to notice the pain again. Not to the point that I’m limping, but I’m starting to become concerned. 

Oh, additionally, around 4 years ago I had a minor cycling accident in which I landed on my right hip. ER doctors didn’t suspect I did any serious damage. Just hurt to walk for few days. I’ve had a permanent ‘bump’ on my hip since then, and the tissue in the bump is numb. But I’ve never had any issues until now, and it only seems to become an issue after 2-3 hours of walking.",2,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g24fv3/24m_persistent_hip_pain/"")",2020-04-15 17:29:44,Physician Responded

g24pdt,Can anxiety cause a fever? (Covid-related),"Hi.  47F, 5’4 and approximately 150 pounds, with prior history of asthma, pneumonia and Crohn’s disease.  I have been evaluated by my doctors as presumed Covid positive since Thursday, April 2nd, due to combination of chills, fever, severe shortness breath and cough (which is persistent but not awful). Had a very bad asthma attack on night of Tuesday, April 7, when pulse ox dropped to 93. (Other than that, have stayed in 95-98 range entire time). Next day, doctor arranged for Covid test and chest X ray. Thank God, test was negative and x ray clear. On Firday, got a nebulizer, used it once a day for four days, helped a ton with the breathing. Fever started coming down too. I have issues with anxiety, so I have also been taking Lorazepam as prescribed (3 mg daily), doing meditation apps, trying to stay away from coronavirus coverage, etc. Between breathing improving, and no fever on Sunday, I started my 72 hour countdown clock on Monday, April 13.

On Tuesday, April 14, no fever but cough and shortness of breath started coming back. Since I was also coughing up clear mucus, and lots of clear drainage from nose, I took Benadryl and cough syrup, in addition to asthma meds. Seemed to be clearing things up nicely. Today, Wednesday the 15th, I woke up at 7 am feeling chilled and kind of sick. Took temperature: 101.7. Since then, I’ve had temperatures of 102.5 (9:30 am, took extra-strength Tylenol), 102.8 (noon, too early for more Tylenol yet) and 101.3 (5:30, took more Tylenol). In the mean time, had a VideConsult with my doctor this afternoon. He was very blunt in telling me that he thinks I have Covid and the test result was wrong. He will have his nurse call me tomorrow, and if I still have symptoms, wants me to come in for second test and and inflammatory markers blood panel.

Sorry to give all of this information up front, but am honestly trying to forgive this out: between fact that first Covid test was negative and X ray was clear last week, and that my pulse ox has stayed good (except for the one 93 reading) the entire time...is there any chance that I am literally doing this all to myself, through sheer anxiety? I know stress can obviously affect breathing, so I have really tried hard to keep stress levels down, but I don’t understand why my fever would be going back up after three days of staying down, especially if my Covid test last week was negative and the x ray was clear. I am scared that I am just freaking myself out, and that I may be about to go into my doctor’s office and expose myself to Covid for real just because my body is so afraid of Covid that I am literally giving myself symptoms. But then I find myself stuck on the fact that my temperature reading is, indisputably, going back up. Is is possible that this is all in my head? If helpful, I shared this theory with my best friend of 20 years, and she said she had never known me to display anxiety to that extreme, and it broke her heart to think of me second guessing myself like this. But I have to think if it ever could happen, maybe now is the time.

g24wjq,32M. Pretty sure I have a bulging disk at C6-C7. Best options for managing it while avoiding going to the doc during COVID?,"32M. 6’0 190 lbs. I hurt my neck/upper back a couple of years ago doing kettlebell swings. It wasn’t bad at the time, just a pop and an ouch (but I never did those again). Lately it’s been a real problem. The area in question is on the left side of my neck in the back, very near to where my neck joins my torso. I can feel the spot in between the vertebrae where it’s very painful to touch. I also get pain and electric shock/tingles down the left side of my back at times. When I’m  physically fatigued it tends to really act up.

It’s pretty minor under current circumstances so I’m trying to avoid the risk going into the doctor’s office right now. I also have Crohn’s disease so I’m under orders from the gastro doc to avoid NSAIDs.

g258zs,ENTs of Reddit...,"I (23F) have a history of ENT issues. I had a tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, and ear tubes inserted all at once when I was five years old. At that time, I had recurring ear infections constantly, whether it was one ear or the other or both. The standard at that time was if you had more than 6 ear infections in 2 years, you should get treatment. I had more than 6 (mom doesn't remember exactly how many) and after that, I hardly ever got sick. In my early adulthood, however, I developed spring allergies that have worsened over the years. Context: I am a lifelong Florida resident but in August '19, I moved to North Carolina. So yeah, hot climate + global warming = surprise, I guess I have allergies now?? 

My issue is this: in this budding spring season/nightmarish pollen takeover, I am experiencing painful congestion mostly in my right ear. Only once or twice it has been on my left side. It is very painful and gives me anywhere from a slight headache to a throbbing migraine. Sometimes I experience tinnitus and vertigo too. A few weeks ago, I thought it was an ear infection so I went to the doctor, and she told me it was a sinus infection (which I now get numerous times a year now as an adult). So personally, I think that I'm experiencing some sinus-related issues or potentially a drainage issue. 

I saw my PCP recently and he said my ear looked fine, but I think I need to see an ENT and potentially get tubes re-inserted in my ears. The pain is awful and all I've found that helps is taking Sudafed, but it takes multiple doses before it starts to work, if it works at all, and it gives me a head cold. This is happening several times a week, basically every other day at this point. 

tldr; ear congestion as a result of adult pollen allergy, history of chronic ear infections as a child, should I see an ENT?",2,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g258zs/ents_of_reddit/"")",2020-04-15 18:19:01,Physician Responded
g25lcl,Loooong-term toenail fungus,"White Male, 31 years old, 5ft6, around 170lbs, smoker. Not on any medication. Dont think its relevant, but for the sake of thoroughness, I have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation triggered by alcohol.


Sort of embarassing, but any help appreciated. Im 31 years old and Ive had toenail fungus for over 10 years. I got it from my dad, and when I asked about treatment, he told me his doctor told him it was incurable. It took me until like 2 years ago to realize that my dad has no idea what he was talking about, and to remember that his doctor was kind of a quack as well. I have severe depression, and that hampered my ability to deal with it, but Ive recently had a breakthrough thats led me to trying to take better care of myself, develop better hygiene, etc. Ive purchased some OTC antifungal creams and have been consciously working on doing all the right things.

My big toes and pinky toes have it the worst(especially the pinky toes) but all 10 are undoubtedly at least minorly affected. I know a picture would help, but my phone camera is broken. 

So, my questions:

Will OTC topical solutions  be enough for such a long-term infection? Should I combine multiple treatments, like my antifungal cream *and* soak them in hydrogen peroxide? Or will I need to get a prescription for something taken internally? I'd also like to be re-assured, assuming its true, that its not pointless, that it is possible to someday be rid of this. A lot of my depression is rooted in a feeling of powerlessness, and my ""incurable"" toenail fungus always felt like a symbol of that. So getting rid of it would be both a health victory as well as a symbolic one against my depression.


Quick edit to add that this is the antifungal cream I purchased:

g25n8u,"Homecare patient with serious bedsores but inadequate care, how do I help her heal?","For background info: I started doing homecare  3 years ago for a quadriplegic woman who manages her own care. I’m not a nurse of any kind. I help her in/out of bed, shower, make her food, do a bowel routine, that kind of thing. We’ve become good friends and she’s fairly young, I think 36 years old now. 

She’s recently out of the hospital after almost 6 months of being in and out of the ICU. She had pancreatitis and an internal cyst that was pushing on her organs. She’d been trached because of breathing problems and fed through a tube several times. 

Because she wasn’t moved around enough, or was too sick to move, she’s developed bedsores. The sores are large, one goes 4cm deep and is 9cm wide. The other is less deep and about 6 cm in diameter, but still bad. When I look up pictures they look like they’re stage 3 or 4. Both are on either side of her anus, on her buttocks. She was given a hydrocortisone cream (I think) and dressings that are just superficial, not packing the wounds at all. 

We had a nurse come today, to show us how to bandage her wounds, who was speechless. She said over an over again how shocked and surprised she was because what was prescribed is out of touch with how bad her sores are. The nurse said she wasn’t qualified to debride the sores, and that she didn’t bring the right supplies because it was made to seem the wounds were superficial. She took pictures and I really hope the nurse advocates for better care, but I don’t know what to do. It sounds like she almost needs a woundvac, but in the least needs debriding and to have her wounds packed right. We have some gauze and ointment. 

TLDR; basically the title, my friend has 2 stage 3-4 bedsores and I feel what was prescribed for her is inadequate to heal her. What can I do to help?

g2904h,"22F, had a LOT of blood after bowel movement so I went to the ER. Tell me what to expect from a GI specialist visit this week?","Hi all,

So, I’m 22F, 140lbs, 5’6. I have a history of minor hemorrhoids for the past few years (every once in a while I have a *rough poop* and blood is on the wipe, several times a month but not daily) that I occasionally treated with PrepH and didn’t think much of. They have increased in frequency over time, however.
  
Tonight I went for a pee and, due to my phone, stayed longer and ended up needing to poo. Worked out fine, needed a little more pushing but nothing crazy or unusual. I wipe. *Holy hell that’s a lot of blood.* I look in the bowl. *FUCKING FRUIT PUNCH.* literally. Imagine a bowl of fruit punch with poop in it. 
  
The mild lower abdomen pain hits. Feel bloated and uncomfortable. I get worried and call a local urgent care place who says they would just send me to the ER anyway. So I say fuck it, off to the ER I go. Not taking chances here. 
  
After a couple hours, results are in: blood and urine tests normal, gave me IV fluids, prescribed me Pepcid and colace (sp?). Pain subsided a lot. Also referred me to a GI specialist as they said that they would be better equipped to see what’s going on, ie. Maybe a colonoscopy. 
  
So I’m sure it sounds like I already got my results but I still don’t know what’s going on and as I sit here, the stomach discomfort is mildly back. To be fair, I ate a good amount of cookies today.
  
Based on this info, should I be more or less worried than a basic “concerned”? I don’t wanna be that person who’s like ?????cancer????? But I don’t wanna be caught blindsided. An unfortunate TMI addition to this is that my previous SO used to stick a finger in my anus (with my consent of course) during sex fairly frequently and that’s when hemorrhoids happened. Before that, wasn’t a thing for me. Pretty sure the irritation from that is what started it.
  
That should be it. I’m just looking for shared thoughts about what this could be and how concerned I should be. Calling the GI specialist first thing tomorrow so don’t worry, I’m following procedure.

Complaint: For the past month and a half my pinkie finger on my right hand has been sore, swollen, hot to the touch, dry, peeling skin, bleeding/seeping.

Other issues: Type 1 diabetes, postural hypotension, severe anxiety, complete lack of appetite.

Current meds: Lymecycline 408mg/day, Desogestrel 75microgram/day, InvitaD3 800 IU/day, Venalafaxine 225mg/day, average 50 units insulin a day - on an insulin pump, diabetes is controlled HBA1c = 65 (was 50, trended up due to hypoglycaemia risk).

I have seen a GP (I'm in the UK and currently they are not seeing patients face to face in my area) and have sent pictures. They merely told me to use the same cream that I use for my acne (mentioned above) I have been for the past 3 weeks.

It was unclear exactly why they made this recommendation - that it makes you more susceptible to catching it, or makes the symptoms or outlook worse if you do catch it.

To my knowledge, if you do get a cough after quitting smoking this is because the celia cells are becoming active again and working to unclog the residue from smoke. I experienced some symptoms like this when I stopped a long time ago, and it lasted a few days.

I get the feeling that it's just some BS to make smokers feel less guilty about continuing, but I'm no kind of medical professional so what the hell do I know?

g2dh4c,Can a stroke (or more precisely a blood clot in the brain) be mistaken as a brain tumor?,"So this is about someone I know who had previously (about 2 years ago) had a type of cancer and had it removed via surgery. This person also takes medication for another condition and that medicine has a side effect of causing blood clotting in the brain. They recently had a what we thought was a stroke, but further tests showed what looked like a 4 cm tumor. The problem is the blood test didn't show anything (? not sure whether blood tests shows if a person has cancer or not). This basically meant that if it is a tumor then it is not a secondary tumor. The oncologist suspects it's a primary brain tumor. The neurologist on the other hand thinks it might be a very large blood clot especially since the patient seemed to improve slightly after taking the medicine for stroke (taken for 1 week). They said that they will run some more blood tests and scans and have sent the results of the tests already taken to other doctors for more opinions. So that brings me to my question can a blood clot in the brain be so big that it is mistaken for a tumor? How common is it for that to happen?

I never had them in New York, Id the occasional seasonal sneezing and sometimes watery eyes but not often. I figured going from such a humid and water level elevation to a dry mountain air climate would have some affect but I guess Im not acclimating well? (Not sure if that's even a thing)

Im now to the point that I have to take [Aerius](https://www.aerius.ca/en/products/aerius-dual-action/) everyday no matter what season or time of year. Im also using eye drops daily, moisturizing or allergy depending on time of day and sometimes I also use a nasal spray (Otrivin Medicated Cold&amp; Allergy) because my nose is so dry that I cannot stop sneezing even with the Aerius which is at least 2-3 times a week. This seems to have gone up because the snow has started melting and the snow mold problem is high.

The real ask: Is there anything else I can do or look into to not have to take this stuff every day or ease up the symptoms? Id like to call my doctor and see if theres anything we can work out but for now thought it would be good to reach out here if I can maybe look into a certain direction or treatment.

I appreciate any insight you can offer!

Side notes: I have not been tested for what Im allergic to exactly. I was tested for Asthma but have since realized that when I do feel out of breath its more because it feels like my throat is closing and I start coughing, not because I don't have the lung capacity.

This caused a large scab to form. I recently decided to peel it off and discovered the skin to have healed, but the capillaries that underneath the skin are exposed. The question I'm now asking is should I start applying the Bazuka gel over the exposed capillaries, or is it a bad idea?

Height/Weight: 6'2, 160lbs

duration/location: \~4 months, genitals

Hello all,

Since December I have had genital herpes like symptoms. I have been blood tested and urine tested multiple times, each time that an outbreak of genital blisters has occurred, but each time the tests come back negative for all STD's, and anything else they test for. The blisters have broken out 4 times total. Each time was started with an outbreak that was very noticeable, had a fowl stench to it, multiple blisters that would rupture and turn into scabs until they scarred over. This was followed by a second outbreak a few days later which had less blisters, with little to no smell.This has happened twice, about 3 &amp; 1/2 months apart. I say four outbreaks because there were four distinguishable sets of sores. The first time this happened, it stung and was a little difficult to urinate for 3 days before the blisters appeared. This has not happened since. I have had one sexual partner in the last year, which is my GF of the last 6 months. She has showed none of these signs, and has also tested negative for everything in blood and urine tests. I have not been able to have a cell culture done as none of the available clinic or hospitals in my area are able to provide them, and given the state of the world rn, I am not able to go to the closest city which is Tulsa. Also, I do know that herpes outbreaks can be associated with stress, and each outbreak I have had there has been a large amount of stress in my life at the time, whether it be personal, stemming from my relationship, or in my college athletic career with my season being cancelled. I don't know what to do besides stay clean, dry and cease sexual activity during the outbreaks.

g2mxd3,2 months of a fever!,"30F 5'2"" 180lbs
Currently taking Paroxetine (weaning off) and Align probiotic. Average smoker. No alcohol or drug use. 

About 2 months ago, I noticed I started getting a low grade fever (99.2-99.8) every few days. Shortly after I started to get diahhrea and stomach pains every day, along with an elevated temp. 
I visited the ER about a month in where they did a CT scan and bloodwork, which were both normal.

I chocked it up to a virus and went along with life. Well, the elevated temp now comes back every single day. When my temp goes any higher than 99.1, I get dizzy and very tired, sometimes nauseous. I visited my family doc.
My doctor prescribed 500mg Flagyl 2x a day for 7 days and started me on the Align probiotic. She also ordered stool samples, which all came back normal. 
After the Flagyl, the diahhrea is not as bad, but I am still getting an elevated temp with the dizziness/tiredness every day.

g2obuj,[24M] Weird skin condition between fingers?,"Hi, 

I've had this condition for a while, however it's been worsening as of recently and I'm not too keen on going out for it right now with corona virus outbreak and all... Couple of general info :  
Male, 24, 5'7"", about 55kg, caucasian. No regular medication. I have asthma and some eczema at times (around knees/elbows, mostly while I was younger). Occasionally drink, never smoked or taken drugs.

This condition has been ongoing for something I would consider about 6-8 months? Basically, I've had smaller pimples on the surface or under my skin between my left middle and ring fingers. These would be pretty benign, and after something like a week or so they would disappear. They would sometime have some sort of mostly clear liquid seeping (I have the terrible habit of squeezing and popping pimples). The skin around the area also seems to be pretty dry. Until I about a month ago, I say I had about 5-6 episodes of this? Lasting about a week, vanishing and reappearing a month or so later at the exact same place. Never really painful, nothing more than a itch and a bit of questions.

However, as of the last month, it's been there and didnt disappear or anything. In fact, its been expanding in size a bit, reaching about my first knuckle and being more uncomfortable. Theres been more liquid, some degree of occasionnal pain (nothing major). I'm not sure exactly what is going on with this, hence why I thought of asking here. Sometimes the pseudo-pimple pop on their own just from me stretching out my fingers or opening/closing my hand. I'm mainly scared about there being an underlying condition or it reaching articulations to the point of restraining/handicapping movement.

g2pbgp,Something is wrong with my jaw,"Hello! I've been recently having an issue that causes me a great deal of anxiety, but I am too scared to go to a doctor since bothering them, especially during these times, just to find out that possibly everything is fine, also causes me a great deal of anxiety.

About me: 21F, around 52kgs, 156cm, quite heavy smoker (8-15cigs/day)
Primary complaint: pain in my jaw, right side, been going on for few days.

To give some extra details, I would like to mention I got my wisdom teeth removed on the right side around 6 months ago and the recovery didn't go as smoothly as I hoped so I ended up with an infection that required antibiotics, but in the end it healed quite nicely. The pain I mentioned started few days ago, seemingly out of nowhere and for no reason. I truly cannot pinpoint what could have caused it. I tried to search it up, but I am still not sure what it could be. My guess is some kind of dislocation which terrifies me and I truly hope it's not. Some of the other issues are pop sounds on certain movements, pain when I bite down, when I yawn and when I push on the other side of my jaw. About half an hour ago I yawned quite widely and I felt a POP like a real scary and loud POP. Since then the pain intensified when biting down, yawning etc and for the first few minutes afterwards I couldn't close my mouth without feeling horrendous pain. I also noticed the jaw slightly shifted towards the right side and my bite is as well different from half an hour ago. 
Here are some other things going on that could or could not be related, but just to make sure: I do have an eating disorder, but I haven't purged in months, only restricted; had some sores in my mouth for few days, went away with no problems; my teeth are relatively fine, just two minor cavities on the left side that will be done soon; for the past few weeks I've had some pain in the upper part of my nose, especially when chewing, but it's slowly going away; since this jaw problem I've been feeling way more fatigued than before and I get lightheaded more often (from 2-4 times a day, to maybe like 6-7); my eating habits haven't changed, I just avoid crunchy things.

I would like to thank you in advance for any help or advice and I would also like to apologize for how long and maybe incoherent I might have been. My intention was to be concise, but sadly I always ramble on and on no matter what the subject. Thank you once again!

g2qgdr,"Please help, horrible horrible pain and no one wants to address it","Hey I’m sorry for the crappy mobile formatting. Thank you for taking the time to read this. 

My husband has cracked a molar and the pulp is exposed to air. We are in Ohio so we took him to an emergency Dentist at the hospital. The tooth needs to be extracted or a root canal + crown done according to the doc. They did an X-ray. The dentist said all procedures that kick up particulates are forbidden. So this would include both of those procedures. The dentist did not prescribe him anything. They said to call back and we did but they just gave him antibiotics. My husband is under the assumption that the nerves will die or just stop registering pain (I know they won’t but he’s not thinking clearly). 

He is taking way too much ibuprofen and still can’t get much relief. The whole left side of his face has some swelling, he’s white as a ghost, and he says the pain starts in his jaw, goes to his eye, temple, upper canines and down his neck. 
Sometimes he looks unsteady or dazed. The doctor said he couldn’t see any abscess or infection but his filling was also in the way on the X-ray. 

I have him in the ER now and hoping they give him something for pain relief. We know they can’t take it out or do anything besides prescribe something. 

Our goal is to get this taken care of at the root cause. Pain killers won’t last long and the dentist said to come back in June. He won’t listen to me about too much ibuprofen and mouthwash etc is doing nothing to help. He can’t work like this. 

He has joked about having me just yank it out with pliers (I definitely won’t because I could break his jaw) because it hurts so bad. 
This is very hard for me to watch him go through. Please, please help us. We are doing all we can as far a social distancing goes and we feel like we are out of options. 

Thank you so much for your help and for all your sacrifices you have been making for this crisis. We appreciate you so much!

However, it’s gotten worse and I now get a widespread erythematous rash on my wrists, ankles, chest/abdomen, and back. Precipitating factors of the rash are whenever I exercise, feel stressed out or mildly inconvenienced, or my internal temperature rises. Occurs 3-4 times a day. It improves with cold temperatures and it is relieved whenever I calm down or cool off. 

I saw my primary doctor in Jan and he simply said i have urticaria, then he gave me topical steroids. However, it’s been getting worse and I want to know the underlying cause of it. Personally I think it’s due to high stress as I am currently studying for an entrance exam to grad school and covid-19 turning world upside down.

g2u5pu,My father (64M) was released from ER today (4/16) and given a script for Plaquenil - aren't there reported deaths for use as Tx for COVID-19? I'm afraid.," Hello,

A wee bit of background info:

* 4/12: Father confirmed positive for COVID-19.
* 4/15: Admitted to hospital for hypoxia (88 SpO2). *Kept overnight for testing/observation; all other vitals/blood work were normal, put on 4L of O2, and an IV.*
* 4/16: Discharged from hospital. *Given a portable O2 tank (Inogen One G5) set at 3L of O2 with instructions to slowly lower over time; also given a pulse ox.*

Meds prescribed on discharge instructions:

* Tessalon perles (100 mg) 1 cap every 8 hours. *Tx started on 3/30 but he's not consistent in taking them.*
* Nyastatin (100,000 units/mL) 5mL 4x per day. *Tx started on 4/13 and drastically helped (I have pics of progression if anyone is curious).*
* **Plaquenil  (200 mg) 2 tab daily for 4 days**

Now,  I will start digging into the literature on trials being done using  hydroxychloroquine as a Tx for COVID-19, but I know I've seen news  headlines of people dying from consuming it. **Can you please shed some light on its use?**

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extra Questions (if time allows):

1. What are some things that seem to help COVID patients on their road to recovery? *I  ordered a humidifier, spirometer, wedged pillows, a handheld massager  (apparently CF patients use this to help their lungs), and I try to get  him to do breathing exercises (pursed lip breathing, holding breath 5  sec. before exhaling) 3x per day.*
2. How often should I take vitals? *I ordered a bp cuff and stethoscope. I was as an EMT in NJ over 5 years ago, so I'm familiar with taking vitals.*

*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

Thank  you all for your hard work, and I appreciate you reading this.

g2w5d4,Strange object removed from Wife's (26) belly button?,"Medical professionals of reddit, I'm hoping you can provide some insight on this. Sorry for the long post, but here it we go. My wife has been reporting being able to feel ""something sharp"" in her belly button since around age 10. She initially believed it to be a tick, so she asked her mom to investigate. Mom can't find anything. Several years later, after we started dating, she asks me to look. I can't find anything. At that time it's going on probably a good 4 to 6 years. Fast forward to 2019 and she gets pregnant. As her belly has started to grow, she feels like she can feel it in there more. Now she's up to 28 weeks and she asks me to look again. I do, and lo and behold, I can see it. Upon discovery, we were quick to grab the tweezers. While it was stuck in her, it looked kind of like a small twig sticking out, except it had a couple of hair like fibers (I guess you would call them fibers) sticking out as well. It took a couple of tries, but I managed to remove it. It was stuck enough to slip out of the tweezers grip and my wife could feel it being extracted. To be clear, this had never caused her any pain, including when I pulled it free, just concern and annoyance. It left a little crater behind, but it didn't bleed. The end that was sticking out is a darkish brown, but the end that was embedded is somewhat light, almost a white color. We're both kind of stumped on what the heck it actually could be. Any ideas?

It is all over her palms and fingers, and occasionally on the back of her hands. It is no where else.

It seems to appear randomly. Changing hand soaps, detergents, not wearing jewelry does not seem to help. 

It has been treated as eczema, ringworm, and contact dermatitis. Long prescriptions of oral and cream antifungals and steroids have not effected the rash much. Steroid creams did make it less painful.

It’s back again, after 4 months absence. She is very frustrated. Without any testing she was prescribed antifungals again.

And it will take a while for my heart rate to get back to a normal resting rate for about an hour or so afterwards. I have also been getting slight spikes during exercise that are not as severe as the ones during and after sexual activity. I usually am in the 130 to 140 range during exercise but have been getting up to the 150s to 160s lately. This has been going on for about two to three weeks now. I did start a new work out regimen and lowered my caloric intake about 2 and a half months ago and lost about 13 to 15 pounds. Occasionally I will also get some chest discomfort and this twitching in my left arm which sometimes leads to anxiety. I have also been experiencing more fatigue and cold sensations in my hands and feet occasionally. 

I do have family history of heart disease in my family. My maternal grandfather has it and has suffered multiple heart attacks. I also have suffered from high blood pressure on and off the past 3 years.

I partially tore the ACL of my right knee in Oct of 2016 at 20 y/o and had surgery in Dec. It was a contact injury playing basketball. Someone landed on my back while I was planting a foot and my knee hyperextended partially tearing the ACL. MRI confirmed no damage to menisci or MCL. Did a patellar graft. Surgery and therapy went fine. I was back to playing basketball within a year. 

In March of 2018 at 21, I completely tore the ACL of my left knee, and partially tore the medial meniscus. This was basketball non contact, basically I planted and pushed off with my knee and hip out of alignment, and my knee buckled outward. This time, MRI confirmed complete tear of ACL, and damage to medial meniscus. Did another patellar graft, and this time the surgeon (different from my first surgery) explained that because the damaged part of the meniscus was still receiving blood flow, he could reattach the tear and there was a chance that it would heal itself. Surgery went fine. 

It’s now two years down the line and my left knee is still in pain during physical activity. Walking is fine, running causes a little irritation, and any sort of cutting or jumping causes severe pain. 

I believe that my medial meniscus is still torn, due to the area of the pain. I don’t have that insecure feeling in each step common with torn ACLs, so I don’t think my ACL is torn.

I heal and life continues but my sister one day wakes up from bed and she has her limbs on her right side flexed and also sh has a deviated smile. She goes to the doctor and sure enough she suffered a stroke she gets her blood work done and it's inconclusive her coagulation profiles are normal but she develops severe neutropenia. Eventually they screen for possible genetic blood disorder and she comes clean. Shes given her physiotherapy and aspirin and closely monitored. That's been the case for 15+ years and to this the cause is inconclusive.

g366wz,did the old man that i saved suffer from alzheinmers or something else?,"last summer after finishing my job in the airport i got in the bus and i was on my way home,after a long time i heard some old man talking to the bus driver i was not sure if he was asking where the adress of his house was or if he wanted the driver to take the entire bus and take it to that adress.

i went there to see if i can help the old man he showed me a card with his name and adress.

the card had""patient id"" written on it as well as""endiburgh pathology""(i don't remember if it was endiburgh or not,but i do remember the word pathology),also note that the card was entirely written at english and this incident happened in greece,the old man was greek too.the adress was english too meaning that it did not exist in the country.

so i told the old man to get of the bus with me and i called the police to come and get him(i told him that i called a friend),the old man was conviced that his house was""just a few blocks away""he asked some driver if we were in the adress his house was and the driver said no,some minutes later the old man forgot about it.

the police took too long to come so we took a taxi and i took him to a police station,the old man was still convinced that his house was""just a few blocks away"".

i convinced the officers that he had some health issue,possibly alzheinmers,they told me that i could go and that he is no longer my rensponsibility.",5,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g366wz/did_the_old_man_that_i_saved_suffer_from/"")",2020-04-17 10:14:56,Physician Responded

Non smoker, no drugs
PMH - just the herniated discs and bursitis 

Hi, I am an RN and may end up working with Covid pts directly as they are cross training us for Covid ICU.  I was in the ER for many years and switched to PACU right before the pandemic hit us (February).  

I have two herniated discs on L4-L5 that cause a constant pain with waves of worsening pain at times. I have very bad bursitis in both knees.  I have bursitis pretty bad on my left hip and intermittent bilateral calf pain. 

I was prescribed gabapentin and was about to start it at a dose of 100mg a day that I can stay at or taper up.  My concern is that one of the listed side effects is an increased risk for getting a virus. I'm assuming I should not take it because of my pt population, but, thought I would get some feedback because I'm not sure how great the risk is and if its dose dependent.

g36z0t,Tennis elbow or something else?,"28/F/5'4""/215lbs - former competitive hockey / ball hockey player.

Pain is on the outside of my left elbow, feels like it is right on the joint or bone - photo of exact location: [https://imgur.com/S4cwqJ3](https://imgur.com/S4cwqJ3)

Cannot grip or lift anything with any sort of weight, not even a small glass, without extreme pain in the elbow. 

I've had what I thought was Tennis Elbow around this same time last year. Last year I attributed it to raking the lawn with an old rake with a small handle (wrong size grip for me). This year we got a new rake with a proper grip handle and the elbow pain has returned. I also don't think it happened immediately after raking... it seemed to just appear out of nowhere waking up one morning.

Last year, because I play hockey, I invested in a brace for my elbow which I've been wearing overnight. At first it seemed to get a bit better but now it seems to have gotten worse despite not doing any sort of raking or exercising using the arm. This year due to the pandemic I'm not even playing ball hockey this time of year which I thought last year was what made it worse / last so long. 

Definitely is significantly more painful at night / when I wake up. I feels like it doesn't matter what position I sleep it (side or back, arm straight or bent) it gets more painful while I sleep (even with the brace on). 

It's now gotten to the point where it doesn't just flare up from using the arm / hand, it just has a constant dull ache even when relaxing. 

Another note is my job is on the computer, I am a graphic designer / developer. I obviously use my right more then my left hand (my right side has no pain at all), but the left is used a lot for ctrl + c &amp; ctrl + v.

I thought it might be something like [cubital tunnel syndrome](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/cubital-radial-tunnel-syndrome) but I don't have any of the numbness or pain in hand. 

Is it just a bad case of tennis elbow that gets exacerbated in my sleep or something else?",3,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g36z0t/tennis_elbow_or_something_else/"")",2020-04-17 10:56:07,Physician Responded
g386mk,Continued Period after IUD,"24F/150lbs/5’8”
Medication: Sertraline

I hade the coil (Mirena) inserted on 7th February. I had pretty severe  cramping afterwards and it triggered my period. The month after that seemed pretty normal and I had my next period as expected in March. However, since then my period hasn’t really ‘finished’. I’m not on heavily enough for me to consider it a ‘normal’ period but I am still definitely bleeding (it’s appears more like bloody discharge, than full on blood). 

I have previously had to have a coil removed because it was in the wrong position. During this first time I was having some of the same symptoms. However, when having my ultrasound scan to diagnose that my coil was in the incorrect position the radiographer said that one of my ovaries looked  like it had some cysts on it. 

Basically, my question is three-fold. Is this irregularity to be expected after having a new coil inserted (and should I just wait it out), is it possible that it’s in the wrong position again or is the something to do with the possible cysts? Thanks in advance.",1,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g386mk/continued_period_after_iud/"")",2020-04-17 11:59:45,Physician Responded
g38is9,Can't Breathe,"Hi all, 

24F, 5'5"" approx. 200lbs. Former smoker, quit over a year ago. No history of chronic physical illness aside from heart palpitations/tachycardia episodes. Take 50 mg Labetalol daily for this. 34 weeks + 4 days pregnant, due May 25. Normal, healthy pregnancy but baby previously measured large. 

The issue is that, for the last 4 weeks, I have felt like there is someone sitting on/squeezing my chest. It starts each day anywhere between 1 and 3 hours after I wake up and continues indefinitely throughout the day. I've been home due to covid-19 and my pregnancy, I'd previously worked directly with the community. It's the most I've been home since we moved into our apartment a couple months back. 

Some details: 

• I live in Wyoming. 

• I've become allergic to my guinea pig because pregnancy is weird. Our place has a lot of dust too so we thought maybe allergies. Tried Claritin and Benadryl. I take both daily. Mixed results.

• My former OB had recommended I try an inhaler so I did. It does not offer relief. He brushed me off otherwise. 

• Sitting up or lying on my back makes it worse. Laying on my side on the floor helps somewhat. Lying in front of a fan usually helps.

• I have been tested (negative) for flu and RSV at Urgent Care. This was the last time anyone listened to my lungs/heart. 

• I have a long history of anxiety and panic disorder. New OB suggests I take Benadryl for anxiety. It makes me tired but does not help otherwise. New OB does not want anything to do with helping the mental health issues; suggested seeing a psychiatrist. 

• Seeing a psych Monday.

Does anyone have any ideas? Anything? I'm losing my mind here with this and it seems like every medical professional I've seen shrugs me off after giving me a half-assed response. Thanks guys.

I am desperate for any advice or answers to what’s happening with me

I put a post on here previously asking advice about my condition, and I got loads of helpful replies- well since January I have lost an alarming 42lbs, I am getting new pains which have started in my upper back, my shoulders, under my ribs in my ?lungs, also pain when I breathe in, also important for this, I had a seizure last month whilst I was out with my friend, I had 2 glasses of wine and went into a seizure and was unresponsive for a few hours in the hospital, they said my blood results were very bad but didn’t explain how, said I could have been extremely ?intoxicated, another doctor said it could have been a ?hypo seizure, but I’m not diabetic, I was also vomiting coffee grounds whilst I was unconscious.
My condition has worsened to the point where whatever I am eating whether it’s plain food or not I am vomiting up with reflux, I only eat every 2/3 days as I feel I’m developing PTSD from eating, I’m physically scared of the pain and vomiting.. I am getting so low and depressed from what’s going on I’ve thought about suicide.

I had an endoscopy(without the camera) down to test how strong my oesophagus was, I had a barium swallow aswell which both showed up perfect, But I also had an oesophageal pH monitoring test done which is to be kept in for 24hours and you get given a diary and a monitor you’re attached too, which you can record your symptoms in e.g whenever you feel pain, whenever you eat, whenever you lay down and sleep etc; I ended up becoming severely ill when I had this in and had to rip it out after 17 hours as I was projectile vomiting everywhere and in absolute agony.
I had my results back from this test which showed I *DO* have some reflux, but I wasn’t experiencing reflux when I was vomiting, or the pain I was recording wasn’t showing as reflux either..? My doctor has said to me that because of this, if I was to be referred to the surgeons they could reject me as it’s not solid evidence of this being reflux and being treatable from surgery which I’m so upset about...
My doctor has now referred me for another endoscopy camera to go down with biopsy’s (I had an endoscopy 6 years ago which showed nothing) to hope they can see evidence of what’s going on.. but this won’t happen for a while now because they’ve stopped all surgeries and endoscopys during COVID unless it’s an emergency, and there’s a long waiting list... the doctor said to me I would have to become severely underweight or unwell in order for me to become an emergency...
I am beginning to lose the will to live, every day life is a struggle, I have started to vomit red blood, sometimes coffee grounds but not in large quantities, I have headaches, I’m in agony every day now, I am losing 1-2 pound per day depending.

My symptoms start as Sulphur burps, then I get upper abdomen pain, then chest pain going into my back and shoulders, then I will get gassy, frequent loose stool, which I will be rolling around screaming and crying from the pain and projectile vomit everywhere; and the smell of my vomit is more extreme than normal vomit, boyfriend describes it as battery acid with rotten eggs. Have been admitted to hospital multiple times when this happens, and every time I have hypertension.

I’m desperate for answers, please if anyone has any solutions or maybe answers to what’s going on with me? Any tests? Or any knowledge of what could be happening with me, it would help so much, me and my family are worried sick and feel I’m slipping through the cracks.

g39uzg,Hearing Discrepancy. How Worried Should I Be About Acoustic Neuroma?,"26 year old male; 6'2; 184lbs; duration: about 2 months. Suffer from health anxiety. 

I started having tinnitus and some ear fullness in my right ear about 2 months ago. I went to my PCP and he referred me to an ENT. The ENT's office had me meet with their audiologist for an evaluation before seeing the ENT (this was about a little over a month ago). The audiologist did the basic hearing test as well as several other exams such as the pressure test. Everything came back normal except that there was a discrepancy in my hearing. The hearing in my right ear is worse than my left. The audiologist said referred to it as ""borderline hearing loss"" because she said that it didn't rise to the level of ""clinical hearing loss."" [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/dB2VgFn) the report (X = left ear; O = right ear). My family and I were pretty surprised by this finding because none of us have noticed me having any hearing issues.

My appointment with the ENT ended up being canceled due to COVID-19 and I moved on to worrying about other things. Frankly, I kind of stopped noticing the tinnitus and forgot about this whole ordeal until the ENT called me this week. 

I'm scheduled to see the ENT next week and am obviously terrified that I could have a brain tumor like an acoustic neuroma. How worried should I be about this? I don't have any other symptoms other than the unilateral tinnitus (not sure if this is psychosomatic though since I stopped noticing it) and the hearing discrepancy. Could my hearing discrepancy be normal in the sense that there's nothing wrong with me?

g3flzy,"I think I have manic bipolar depression, but that diagnosis doesn’t make sense.","Hi. I’m a 16 year old male. 

Lately, I’ve been seeing the symptoms of bipolar depression in myself. I mean like literally all the symptoms that come up when you research it. I have mood swings, sadness, elevated mood, anger, anxiety, apathy, euphoria, guilt, hopelessness, loss of interest, irritability, risk taking behaviors, agitation, crying, increased sex drive, hyperactivity, impulsivity, restlessness, thoughts of self harm. I lack concentration, I have racing thoughts and feel like my mind is moving too fast for me, slowness, I definitely see myself having false beliefs of superiority, I usually realize that when I’m having the exact opposite and feel inferiority, I’m paranoid a lot and feel on edge. I also have what seems to be insomnia, and can’t put my mind to sleep, it’s like my body has called it quits and my brain is still on speed. I’ve also experienced fatigue and felt dizzy and disoriented for no apparent reason. One thing everyone I know points out is that half the time I speak so slurred and slowly that I’m almost incoherent and the rest of the time I have frenzied speech and people can’t keep up. Another big thing I didn’t realize might be a symptom is weight fluctuation. My cousin always tells me I look like a different person every other time he sees me. There are times where I can’t get my shirt over my stomach and there are times where my pants become too loose for my waist. 
-
As I read into it more and more, and realized how much it described me, I noticed one key thing that doesn’t seem to fit me into a bipolar diagnosis. I looked into Unipolar Depression, Bipolar-1, Bipolar-2, and Cyclothymia. I don’t fit into Unipolar depression because there are times where I feel really happy and am in a euphoric state and I’m not consistently depressed. Bipolar-1 doesn’t fit because I don’t go into a week of depression and a week of mania. Bipolar-2 doesn’t fit for the same reason. This is only based on what I’ve read, could be wrong. I settled on Cyclothymia but even that I’m not sure about. What I feel is odd about my condition (which may be normal and idk anything) is how frequent and severe my mood swings are. They can happen hour to hour when they are really severe and in 5 minute intervals when they’re less severe.
-
With the hour to hour ones, I will go from a depressed state where I can’t muster up the motivation to leave my bed or eat if I’m hungry or do any of the activities I really enjoy doing, to experiencing mania where I’m hyper and my mind is moving 100 miles a minute, I’m full of energy, ideas and motivation. I notice that I do more risky things (especially scary while driving). I have grandiose delusions and feel like I can do anything at all. I feel on top of the world for one hour and then I’m back to a depressed state. 
With the 5 minute intervals, things are less severe, I’ll just feel happy for a bit and overall content and then be hit with a wave of sadness or depression. A lot of this makes it hard to focus on school right now. I don’t feel like I’m ever in a normal state unless I’m completely distracted by writing my thoughts like this or watching tv or listening to music. The other night, I was in a manic state without realizing, and I suddenly had a moment of realization and saw that I was driving 60 mph through a neighborhood at 1 AM. I was aware of my actions but they didn’t feel like they had consequences until I suddenly felt aware and depressed again. I also woke up that next morning to 5 full original songs written out in my notes that I did remember writing but the content of the lyrics was basically new to me. It feels like for an hour I’m on speed and on Xanax the next hour. I’m not sure what’s going on. I’ve routinely used both in the past, more than 2 years ago, could that have an effect? Probably not. I’ve thought about other stuff, I’m 16 there’s probably hormonal stuff going on but I’ve experienced this my whole life, just never this severe. I thought it was normal til now. I also was broken up with just under a month ago and have felt depressed about that, maybe that has something to do with it.
-
Bottom line is I’ve always had mood swings and found them normal, but they’ve never been this severe and frequent. Sometimes it’s a sudden switch and I’m really hyper or really depressed. Most of the time, I can feel it happening. I’ve been pretty depressed for the past hour or two with sudden spurts of hyperactivity and happiness every now and then. As I’m typing this, I can feel myself slipping into the other side of the extreme and I’m having more trouble typing and staying focused as my mind speeds up more and more. I’m also starting to feel restless and fidgety.
-
I had to take a break from typing, I went and played basketball for an hour but still felt overly hyper and manic. I don’t know what’s going on with me. I just want to know if this could be something else or if I do have what I thought. Any advice helps. Thanks

TL;DR:
I’m having symptoms of manic bipolar depression but my mood swings are very frequent (hour to hour) they’re also very severe and I’m either too depressed to do anything or so hyper and restless that I can’t stop moving and talking. Not sure what I have.

g3fzei,Is it possible to move an organ out of place?,"It’s a really long story but I’ll try to keep it short. The person in question is my brother, 31M, 5’9” and around 135 lbs. Non-smoker/non-drinker and is not on any medication that I know of. 


Around 8 years ago he moved back home because he wasn’t feeling good. His major symptoms were trouble eating because when he did he would get “brain fog,” where he couldn’t think straight. We took him to doctors but not much came out of it. It got worse and worse. He ended up by having a sinus surgery when he was in Brazil because he said he couldn’t breathe right. We tried talking him out of it but he wouldn’t listen to us. He also had his gallbladder taken out in I think 2015 and a couple of hernia surgeries around that time as well.


It’s been 8 years and he still isn’t eating right. Because of that his blood sugar is going crazy when he does eat. He’s got every test under the sun done and most things are normal. The ones that don’t come back normal he still won’t get fixed because it’s not “addressing his problem.” Such as a positive result for H pylori. 


My brother is fixated on his chest (epigastric region) and believes he moved something out of place. About 7 years ago he was digging into into chest hard to help him breathe and he says something happened and he hasn’t been right since. He is beyond fixated on not only his chest but the fact that he moved something. I was looking up the vagus nerve and said maybe he damaged it, but he won’t listen to me. Every time someone mentions that it’s unlikely he moved something in his chest (there’s been no evidence despite all the tests he’s had), he gets extremely upset and says it’s because the doctors are incompetent and we need to find the right one. 


I think there are psychiatric components involved, but I don’t know if psychiatric caused this or if not eating/low blood sugar is causing psych. 


So I guess my question is, is it possible to move an organ out of place?

I just want to help my brother but I don’t know how to get through to him. Thanks for listening.",2,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g3fzei/is_it_possible_to_move_an_organ_out_of_place/"")",2020-04-17 19:37:16,Physician Responded

g3gezb,Bizarre systems that are making me miserable,"Throwaway account due to how embarrassing my issue is. Apologies if the story is a bit graphic.

I don't even know where to start, except by saying that the last 3 years of my life have been generally miserable due to this issue I've been having.

It all started back in June or July of 2017, when I masturbated to orgasm 20+ times in a row due to me feeling like I did not get all of the seman out.

After I did the afformentined act, it felt like there was severe pain around the inside of my body, and I didn't do anything since I was staying at a hotel with my family at the time, and was too embarrassed to explain what I did to them.

Fast forward years later, and I'm having severe issues. I have to ejaculate several times in a row to feel like I get everything out, and if it doesn't feel like I got everything out, I have severe brain fog to the point where I can't focus on anything or enjoy anything.

This has made the past couple years of my life miserable. I can't focus on anything or enjoy anything since it feels like there's something in me that I can't get out.

This isn't a porn addiction or whatnot, this is entirely physical. Sometimes when I ejaculate, the brain fog and mental anguish goes away, but only if I feel like I've gotten everything out. Which is rare.

I've looked all over the internet, and can't find much on the issues I'm having. The closest thing I've come across that might be what I have is Chronic Nonbacterial Prostatis, but I am unsure.

This problem has caused problems with my work life, school life, social life etc, and I just want my life back before the incident mentioned earlier happened. I didn't have the afformentioned issues before the incident.

I also have severe OCD and some anxiety if that pertains to anything

Any help will be greatly greatly appreciated. Thanks

Dr finally put me on meds as it was starting to hang around 150/96 average. Basically he had me come in and have it checked once a week for 4 weeks and then prescribed me meds to control it. This was a student health doctor at college and I kinda feel like I was rushed through the diagnosis. My question, is this the normal procedure for being diagnosed or should I get a second opinion? I have no family history of hypertension but the doc didn’t seem concerned. What is the usual procedure for diagnosing someone of my age with hypertension? It is now much closer to normal on meds, I just want to make sure he didn’t rush me through and miss any crucial diagnostic tests.",1,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g3r9wq/hypertension_diagnosis/"")",2020-04-18 10:24:57,Physician Responded

&amp;#x200B;

Started yesterday. Right testicle hurts (not badly, probably like a 2/10 on the pain scale) when I sit, hurts worse when I walk (3/10), and hurts the most when I bend over (5/10). When I touch one certain spot it hurts very bad (7-8/10). This spot is on the sack, slightly above the very top of the testicle. 

There does not seem to be any swelling. No other symptoms besides pain. I doubt its a testicular torsion because the pain isnt horrible. The internet said it could be a groin hernia but i dont see a buldge anywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am avoiding the doctor because I live with someone who is immunocompromised and my county has a high number of covid-19 cases.

g3v6mh,Stepfather acting belligerent,"62M, white, no medical issues or medications, smokes pot daily.

My step father has always been a moderately argumentative person. However, he has become absolutely belligerent over the last few weeks and keeps getting in arguments that make absolutely no sense whatsoever. Like, completely unrelated to whatever the topic is and he will just start on an angry rant thats not relevant at all.

The biggest thing I’ve noticed is his Facebook. He has recently begun to argue about anything and everything. There was a video someone shared that was just a comedic tutorial on how to make face masks. He commented, “Lets open up the state and get back to business! This is a political hoax mathematically speaking. Laugh now but what will you do when they come for you??” What?!

There has been numerous other posts where he will comment and get in 73 comment arguments that MAKE NO SENSE and are not relevant to the post at all. His comments make so little sense that half the people he’s talking to will respond and say “What are you talking about?!” and he will respond with another nonsense paragraph or two. He will also randomly do this super fake, extremely exaggerated laugh at inappropriate times.

I honestly feel like he might be experiencing a manic episode or early signs of dementia or something??

I’m having a baby in a couple months and the way his behavior is currently, I don’t really feel comfortable with him around my baby. If this is some sort of mental illness I’d like to have my mother get him checked out before my child goes to their house.

g3w1fc,[18M] I have hard spots on the left side of my penis,"English isn't my first language, so I'm sorry if I can't explain my problem properly.
I have a hard spot on the left side of my penis. I have it for a long time, but I'm not sure how long (could be years). I'm scared going to a doctor because of my penis size. My penis is only around 8cm long when hard, and the size differs when it's flaccid. Right now it's for example around 4cm long.
When my penis is really small (for example when it's cold) it's wrinkled on the left side because of the hard spot.
And a lot of times, my penis bend to the left (I don't know if that is the correct word. Is it bend or curved?) Especially when it's getting hard. It's bending a lot to the left (where the hard spot is) and then straightens up. 
I can feel the hard spot, but I can't define it. When I feel on with my finger on the right side of my penis, I can slide my finger up and down smoothly. But on the left side, it's like I'm hanging on the hard spot (I bet I said that wrong).
When I urinate, my urin stream is going to the left shortly before I'm finished (I don't know how to describe this).

g3wq6m,Asking for my father here. Literal medical mystery. He's seen multiple doctors at this point but can't get a straight answer.,"My dad's been experiencing chest pains for about 3 years now give or take. But back then when they started, they weren't as severe. He says that every time he eats solid foods, a half hour later he gets intense chest pain. He told me it starts along the collarbone and radiates around the sternum (?) like around the middle of his chest. Drinking water is okay. He can take liquids just fine. A couple days ago he came home from work in pain. He said he had half a tuna sandwich and a few crackers. It seems to be any solid food at this point? He even tried eating apple slices and was in pain after. 

He's been to multiple doctors and specialists. I think 4-5....maybe 6? Because they were either heart, respiratory, or GI, plus his PCP. One doctor said the chest pains had something to do with having low oxygen at night, and during the daytime, his body is trying to replenish it and that's why it hurts. So he was put on a CPAP. He's been using it for almost a month now and it's had a minimal effect. Next doctor said it was acid reflux and gave him a prescription antacid to take. He looked up what foods he would have to avoid and as a result, stopped drinking coffee and beer, cut back on fried food, and avoided certain fruits/vegetables. Still in pain. Another said it was either sever allergies or asthma. Respiratory specialist did some breathing tests and they turned up nothing. 

He looked up his symptoms online one day and came to the conclusion that he either has : A hiatal hernia, GERD, or reflux esophagitis. However, the GI specialist he went to see did an endoscopy and said everything looked fine.  The symptoms of the hiatal and the esophagitis hit the nail on what he experiences but every doctor he talks to rules them out. 

It's so bad to the point where he says he want to kill himself. He can't bear to live in constant pain, he's miserable, he says he'll starve to death because he can't eat anything. He hasn't attempted yet, but I'm scared he will and the pain makes it difficult to reason with him. But he never told any of his doctors about being suicidal. He says it's none of their business. 

*Some more info:*
 
He's 58.

The weight I wouldn't know, but for 6'2"" he's slightly overweight, or at least that's what he says.

There's no family history of GI or heart issues. 

He recently had surgery for an umbilical hernia (within the past 2 years). 

The medications he was prescribed for this were
Omeprazole DR 40mg, Sucralfate, Famotidine 40mg. He was also prescribed BREO Elliot's for the asthma (?) and takes Benadryl occasionally. He's on medication for high blood pressure, Valsartan 1.25mg.

Used to have 2 sometimes 3 beers daily/nightly but has stopped entirely. No history of smoking or recreational drug use. 

*His symptoms are again:*
Chest pain after eating
Occasional shortness of breath
Chest congestion

The pain is the one symptom that stands out the most now. 

So like I said, this is a literal medical mystery and hopefully someone who's a doctor he HASN'T seen yet might have a clue.

April 16 I went to my PCP to get a follow up X-ray, but instead I got admitted to the hospital due to my doctor’s concern about my heart/tachycardia (I was discharged the next morning). This time, the X-ray came back clear, but my blood work is really freaking me out:

I’ve read that COVID patients with a NLR of more than 3.13 have a poor prognosis. My NLR was 3.92 at the time of the test. I’m freaking out because just three days earlier, my tests looked fine.

g3x5s3,"Update to very strange symptoms, Diagnosed!: (F28) DESPERATE/WEIRD: When driving, I suddenly feel like I'm in free-fall or on a roller-coaster and it gets unbearably intense until I must pull over or risk accident","[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/foatya/f28\_desperateweird\_when\_driving\_i\_suddenly\_feel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/foatya/f28_desperateweird_when_driving_i_suddenly_feel/)

I just wanted to update because although my post got only a couple replies, I had been googling this issue frantically and had never read a similar story. After the comments mentioned driving anxiety/phobia, I was onboard about that being my problem. 

It got a lot worse. I went from not being able to drive to feeling like I was on ""the rollercoaster"" all the time. It's hard to describe, it wasn't something I would describe as dizziness, rather an illusion of motion. It felt like I was in hyperspeed when I was standing or sitting still. It also came along with intense feelings of panic/adrenaline rush. 

And also something that was apparently relevant, I listed a prior condition as asthma. I was referring to exercise induced asthma, I have severe attacks of crushing chest pain and shortness of breath and occasional fainting with any amount of exertion. I was being treated with inhalers that were completely ineffective and thought I had refractory asthma which I was waiting to address until after the pandemic. 

So this ""rollercoaster"" feeling became intensified and constantly present, and weirdly so did my shortness of breath and other symptoms. At one point I was lying down in bed but trapped by the feeling of falling and near-fainting. It was torture I really can't even describe it, it was a sensation worse than pain or panic, like a constant free-fall. 

At one point during this, I was concerned about my shortness of breathe and I bought a pulse oximeter and put it on during an attack. I was really surprised to see my oxygen was completely fine and my pulse was over 200 bpm. For some reason, I never felt like my heart was racing. Ever. 

I assumed it was panic but it was extremely consistent. When I had the symptoms, I had an extremely high heart rate. I still had no idea at the time any of this was related. I thought oh my god, I have this strange roller-coaster disease, my asthma is flaring up, and now my heart is racing. What the hell is wrong with me? 

I spoke to my doctor and a cardiologist who both comforted me with absolute insistence that my heart rate was impossible. A young, thin, active woman could not have a heart rate of 200+ that persists for most of the day. I told them I compared against 3 monitors, and they told me I was likely using them wrong but they would definitely get me in just to check with an EKG. 

I said no and demanded an exercise stress test. They told me those weren't  for people with my symptoms/background and I'm not in any risk categories etc. I insisted. Actually I cried, and told them I have had resting EKGs and they are always normal. I'm fine when I'm resting. My issues are only caused by exertion. Put me on a treadmill or I will find a doctor who will. 

They agreed and scheduled an echo and cardiac stress test ""to alleviate my anxiety."" The echo was normal and the doctors kept remarking that my pulse and blood pressure were perfect. 

I remember them reassuring me that I was completely fine and healthy as I went to do the cardiac stress test. I told them I hope they're right, and then stood up to get on the treadmill. My heart went past 150 with standing. The nurse immediately said ""Oh my gosh you're having a panic attack."" I told her no, I'm completely calm, I am not having a panic attack and if I sit down you will see my pulse lower. She sat me down and my pulse went to 85. They brought in the cardiologist and I got back on the treadmill. Within 6 seconds of treadmill my heart passed 200 bpm and I also had an attack of the weird vertigo. 

A bunch of shit happened after that. They ended the test early and my blood pressure passed 225 systolic. They wanted to send me to hospital but eventually it went down. I was kept for some additional testing, but everything was seen during the cardiac stress test. 

I was diagnosed with hyperadrengeric postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter. I guess all of those were seen on the treadmill. The cardiologist said, ""oh and by the way, your rollercoaster thing? That's not vestibular damage, it's your heart."" Luckily I had an episode of that during the test and it was caused by one of the arrhythmias. 

They actually apologized and told me that it was easily missed for so long because it was so unexpected in a patient of my profile. I understand, but I have lost a lot of my life to being sick and on the wrong type of medication. Apparently I do not have asthma and my lungs are great. The albuterol was also worsening my heart conditions. 

Now I am medically restricted from driving for now, and I'm on high dose beta blockers and fludrocortisone. It helps the POTS but I still have the SVT and afib. I may need ablation for that or a pacemaker down the line since those don't seem to be responding to the propranolol. 

Overall I feel 90% better. It's like I'm a brand new body. Apparently it's not normal to feel like you're having a massive adrenaline rush at all times. And a note to doctors and patients alike: it is possible for young, thin, active females with anxiety to have heart conditions. Yes it's unlikely, but not impossible, and that seems to be a forgotten sentiment.

g3xnf7,24M. Is it possible I have renal disease?,"182 pounds, 6 foot 2 (about 83kg/1.89meters)
Jewish. 

I found out through profuse experimentation why I've been feeling so, so bad after eating (1-2 hr after) and it is linked to protein. I've had this issue for ten years-ish and it has gotten progressively worse. 

I've tried all sorts of protein. I combine it with healthy fats and carbs in meals. I tried going vegan and eating soy protein with meals. I tried just having fish every now and then. If I eat it with nuts/other fats the effect is diminished. 

I track macros. Anything above 80grams of protein per day I start experiencing symptoms, the more protein the worse off I feel. It can get ***bad***.

At the swipe of a fork I can go from happy and normal to suffering and absolutely suicidal. Miserable.

Symptoms include mood changes, mid back pain, erectile dysfunction, thirst, inability to think. All after I eat protein. Gets worse with animal protein. 

Bun levels around 35, creatinine 1.06, uric acid at 3.7, all per deciliter from a blood test two years back. Going to get a new one soon. 

I'm now on a vegan diet where I mostly eat nuts and fruits.

Not looking for a diagnosis. You are not my doctor, I have an appointment.

This is just one internet stranger asking another if it around ten years of misery ***might*** have an explanation. I've wanted to kill myself over this plenty of times and for the first time in my life, I'm so happy, for months now, and the absolute only thing that has changed is I found what makes me feel so bad all the time. 

I've tried shrinks, antidepressants, heck, I was diagnosed with several diseases, bipolar 2 included. No treatment helped or made a difference. 

I am competely stable. I'm not too happy or going on crazy shopping sprees or whatever. I never did. I never had any of the ridiculous things I've been stamped with just to get me out of the doctor's hair. 

My girlfriend says she's seen a tremendous change in me these past few months. We've been together for ten months, four of which I've started this low protein, healthy fats with every meal way of eating.

My doctor preliminarily diagnosed it as DYSPEPSIA. (I never had any history of stomach discomfort prior to this episode).  She asked me to avoid fasting and suggested I eat in small quantities in regular intervals instead of huge portion in one go. 

It's been a couple of months since then. I didn't fast at all meanwhile and I was eating huge portions at one go regularly. But I haven't been feeling much of discomfort in my stomach.

Now I want to lose few pounds. I wanna kickstart it with a 4 day fast. 

Can the experts here guide me on how to fast for long time without damaging my stomach lining? Does avoiding coffee and consuming table salt water help?

g5ikgn,26f white lesion surrounded by blood vessels on lip. Both doctor and multiple dentist say they’ve never seen anything like it.,"26f, 127ibs, 5’7, only medical condition is asthma, I’m not on any medication. So around 8ish years ago a white dot and bloodvessel showed up on my lip. I could barely see it now years later it’s grown to this monstrosity on my lip. The skin above it is always dry and flaky no matter how much I try to moisturize it. It’ll go away for a little, but always comes back if I don’t moisturize religiously. I’ve asked multiple dentists what it could be. All of them say they don’t know, but it doesn’t look serious. My doctor also doesn’t know. She referred me to a dermatologist. My dermatologist appointment won’t be for another month, and I’m getting worried about it. I discovered a movable soft lump in my cheek on that side, I’m not sure if that has anything to do with it.

g5ivok,Pregnancy chances? A little paranoid.,"22F. 210lbs. 5’4”. Slynd for birth control. Gastric sleeve surgery. 

I’ve posted this elsewhere, but also wanted an opinion from here if possible. 

I have been taking Slynd for 6 months now. 

Boyfriend and I regularly use pull out method. I have only ever taken one pill late (03/23) which was the last pill in my pack. I take them at 9 AM, I ended up taking this one at 5 PM. Slynd website says its window is 24 hours before it counts as missed — but I’m still iffy. I took one day of the placebos and started a new pack on 03/25. We had sex on 03/25 where he pulled out. He cleaned himself and then put it back in, though. 

I took a pregnancy test on 04/17 that came out negative. It was FMU. However, my period hasn’t come and I’m on my fourth (last) day of placebos. My cervix feels hard and normal, and I don’t really have any other symptoms — except for really sharp, small pelvic pains and around my abdomen. 

What are my chances? Should I test again?

I took a test yesterday and it was negative, too. 

I did not have a withdrawal bleed when I skipped the placebos. The last pack I took had me bleeding for about 3 weeks straight, and every day was very heavy bleeding.

g5jos7,I suspect my mother (f47) is abusing her prescription medication.,"Sex: female
Age: 47
Height: 5'4"" 
Weight: unsure but definitely obese
Race: white
Primary complaint: suspected drug abuse
Duration: 6 months+
Current medications: prednisone (unsure of dosage) hydromorphone (suspect being abused) some kind of anti depressant, high doses of Advil nighttime extra strength... unsure of any others. 
Medical conditions: lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, depression

I apologize about the formatting as I am on mobile and quite upset. I am using a throwaway for privacy. 

As in the title I (F26) suspect that my mother (F47) is addicted and abusing her prescription dilaudid (hydromorphone). 

A bit of background. My mother lives with my husband and I. About 10 years ago she was diagnosed with Lupus, with few other chronic illnesses (rheumatoid arthritis) this leads her to be in a quite high amount of pain. Fairly recently, (last 2 years or so) Her doctor has prescribed her with hydromorphone to keep her pain under control. 

Over the last few months we have come to suspect that she is at the very least misusing her medication if not straight up abusing it. 

Signs which lead us to believe she is abusing her medication:

We hear snorting sounds coming from her room several times a day, several large snorts at a time followed by smaller ones. 

She has nosebleeds on an almost daily basis. When asked about the nose bleeds, she mentions she has ""ulcers"" in her nose causing them to bleed.

 We find bloody q-tips in the garbage. She appears ""high"". Blood shot eyes, pupils don't dilate properly.

she is tired all the time, craving sugar all the time. Passes out various areas in the house, sometimes with blueish lips

 lies about money &amp; asks to borrow money. (She is on disability due to her Lupus)

Her hygiene is deplorable. She will go several days without a shower. She reeks of urine and sweat so badly it lingers on our fabric couch for ages. We have to wash out couch covers/ use fabreeze very often. 

Along with this she is taking way to many Advil nighttime extra strength. We have witnessed her use an entire bottle of 40 pills over the course of less than a week and a half.

 She also binge drinks, consuming 1 or 2 large bottles of wine over the course of a weekend. 

Obviously she needs to get help. She is danger and our lives are miserable living with this. We have no idea how to approach dealing with this situation. 

I appreciate any and all advice.",2,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g5jos7/i_suspect_my_mother_f47_is_abusing_her/"")",2020-04-21 10:36:18,Physician Responded

White, 5’5”, 140lbs
Duration: roughly 2-3 months

Hi all, I’ve had eczema since I was a baby, usually it’s not an issue, I’ll get a little patch on my arm, or my stomach, it comes and goes but it doesn’t bother me much.

Since Covid has started though I assume the stress has added to a flare up- although it’s around my eyes. From my top lash line up to above the crease of my eyelid, and under the bottom of my bottom lash line down to my cheeks. If I just leave it it continues to get worse. The skin starts flaking off almost like scales. It makes my eyes water a lot, it’s itchy, it looks disgusting.

Now I have prescribed ointment that I’ve been using which clears it up in a couple of days however as soon as I stop using it it comes back. I’m getting worried about using the ointment so much because I know with steroid ointments your skin can become dependant on it, and I absolutely don’t want that. 

I don’t have any pictures from when it’s bad, and right now I’m in a period of just having used the ointment so there is nothing to see, that’s why I haven’t uploaded any pictures.

What’s the best way to deal with this? I went to a clinic and they ignored me telling them it was eczema and gave me antibiotic eye drops and that only made it worse.

Please help, I’m walking around with either super goopy eyes from the ointment which looks gross, or all the skin around my eyes flaking off which also looks gross. Thank god for quarantine.

I got my blood checked by my doctor several months ago and apparently my A1C was 5.8 which indicates pre-diabetes. Diabetes does run pretty strongly in my family. My mom has it, my aunts have it, and all 4 of my grandparents had it. 

Because my mom has diabetes we do have a blood sugar testing kit at home. My blood sugar actually drops significantly, quite frequently, and usually goes into the 50s and has gone into the 40s before. Because of this I do check my blood sugar a few times a week to monitor it. Not every day, but several times a week. And its NEVER high. Its never even above 120 even right after eating. 

I am due to see an endocrinologist that I will bring this up to but because of the whole coronavirus her  office is shut down for the time being. 

I guess I just wanted to know how its possible to be pre-diabetic if my blood sugar is always normal to low?

g5ne0p,Is it possible IV fluids will “wash out” drugs in my body?,"This has been haunting me and I think a group of professionals is better than my friends’ opinions. About a month ago, before the lockdown in my country, I went out for some beers with my friends to a local bar. I (25F) drank past my limit (7-8 craft beers) but I was still coherent and aware. After getting my last drink from the bartender who was very flirty and suggestive toward me, I don’t remember a thing. My friends told me I got really sick and puked in the bathroom, then they took me home to my parents. My mom told me I said I couldn’t feel my feet, hands or face and that I asked to be taken to the hospital. 


While in the hospital I was given IV fluids to wash the alcohol off my system. Everything was fine with my body, but they never checked for drugs. Everyone just assumed I got too drunk (which I’m not saying I didn’t). The next morning I took a drug test at a reputable lab that came out negative. 


I’d like to add that what happened to me is extremely unlike me, I’d never ended up in the hospital due to alcohol intoxication and have never asked anyone to take me to the hospital. I do not remember a single thing from that night, and while it might very well have been that I drank too much, I’m still iffy whether the bartender spiked my last drink or not. It was very black and white from before and after that last drink. Before: talkative, coherent, drunk but fully functional. After: completely blacked out and vomiting.

I was thinking its some kind of bug bites and that's still a possibility, but I've checked my bed for bugs and washed my sheets and the spots are still appearing. There's no possibility that it's an STD. Here's a link to pictures of the different locations. Any help is appreciated, I used one of those video call doctor services and they didn't provide me with any info on what it might be. I currently am using a topical antibiotic and 1% hydrocortisone cream. Link: https://ibb.co/album/pBcZ92

g5ouv2,Scammed by a nutritionist?,"Female, 27 y/o. 5'1 and 135 pounds. History of anorexia, fibromyalgia, and currently being worked up for autoimmune.

&amp;#x200B;

I also posted on [r/legaladvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/)  to figure out what to do. I'd like a doctor's perspective on the  ethics/legality of this. I recently contacted a nutritionist from my  insurance website. I struggle with an eating disorder, as well as  chronic pain and autoimmune problems, and she claimed to specialize in  dealing with at least the pain issues. It said ""investment"" on the  website and paperwork a few times, but many nutritionists say this  because insurance is tricky about coverage for them.

When  I met with her (virtually) she said that we would do an in-depth look  at my symptoms and history, then if I was ""a good fit,"" she would  explain how she works. We went through my history and she decided she  could potentially help me....but.

This  is where things got weird. She asked me ""how would you feel about  investing $4,000 to change your life?"" At this point, I knew it was  ridiculous, but was curious about what she was charging all that for.  It's for 3 months of an ""inflammatory protocol"" which will involve a  ""restrictive diet."" She said that while insurance would cover the  meetings ($600), the other $3,400 would be my responsibility.

They  use a test called MRT - is there any validity or reason to think this  would work? No research I found seemed to indicate any research backing  it up. She also acknowledged that putting an anorexic on a severely  restrictive program could be dangerous, so we would ""tweak"" it.

My  question is - is this legal? It's clearly a scam, but is there anything  I can do? My insurance company likely won't cover another assessment appointment, since she billed this to my insurance, so I'm not sure  where to go from here.

Additionally,  she has some REALLY major organization logos on her website that she clearly has no affiliation with. What can I do? I just want some help  and to help others avoid this if it's as ridiculous as it seems.",1,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g5ouv2/scammed_by_a_nutritionist/"")",2020-04-21 15:08:55,Physician Responded
g5oz1j,"34M, 160lbs | Considering removing my own hemerrhoids at home","No significant medical history besides severe hemorrhoids, no medications, caucasian.

Hello everyone. I know the title may sound kind of ridiculous, but I'm pretty much at the end of my rope with my hemorrhoids. They've been bothering me endlessly for the past several years, and no amount of topical creams or suppository solutions have done anything for me. I've pretty much tried every option. I'm not totally broke, but I don't have a lot of spending money and I do not want to spend the copious amounts of money it would cost for a doctor to perform a  hemorrhoidectomy on me.

I've done a moderate amount of research on the procedure and I believe I can perform it myself at home. From my research I've been able to gather that there are multiple methods of performing the surgery, but I plan to use the ""rubber band"" method to cut off bloodflow to the hemerrhoids. I own pair of surgical scissors I will use to make the incisions and actually cut them off. I have some towels just in case there is any bleeding, but I will have cut off bloodflow so I don't think it's likely. I believe I have all the cleaning supplies required to sterilize my bathtub, which is where I plan to perform the operation.

I will be going through with this soon. Before I do though I would like to know if there are any serious risks associated with this, and if I need to have someone else present to help, or if this is something I can do by myself. I would rather not subject my wife to witnessing this so I've planned to do it while she is out of the house.

I can blurred vision, double vision or cross-eyed, lose bits of memory (ex, I had one of these episodes during a meeting, I apparently got up at the end of the meeting but I don't remember doing so), sometimes those pre-dream startles or hallucinations/dreams, etc. It comes on suddenly and lasts maybe an hour or so.

g63rpx,Severe stomach issues a week and a half after consuming a sweetener I’m sensitive to,"24F, 5’8, 122 lbs, white. Drink occasionally, smoke rarely. Preexisting conditions are PCOS and likely IBS. Prescribed medications include 2000mg Metformin, Rosuvastatin (I forget the dosage), and 100mg Spironolactone.

I have had digestive issues since I was 18-19, around the same time my PCOS symptoms started to kick in. Food often doesn’t agree with my stomach and I’ll have diarrhea or watery, loose stool after eating, alongside cramping and general abdominal discomfort. I also feel like I have trouble fully evacuating my bowels at times. A couple years ago I underwent a surgical procedure to repair a chronic anal fissure likely as a result of my screwed up bowel movements. They also removed an internal hemorrhoid while they were in there. 

All that being said, my bathroom problems have never been as severe as the current situation. On January 1st I started a ketogenic diet to treat my insulin resistant PCOS. I began consuming a lot of products with artificial sweeteners in them, and using those sweeteners to bake instead of sugar. I quickly noticed that I am sensitive to or intolerant of to sugar alcohols, because they always gave me diarrhea. At first, though, it was mild and tolerable. I didn’t want to give up sweets, and diarrhea wasn’t exactly new to me, so I kept eating the sweeteners. My reaction to them started getting worse and worse. Sometimes I’d take an anti-diarrhea pill to counteract it. However, the aftereffects of eating sugar alcohols only ever lasted for a day or two at most.

A week and a half ago, on Easter Sunday, I made a batch of cinnamon rolls with the sugar alcohol allulose in them. I took 20-25 trips to the bathroom that day, with violent diarrhea to the point where even after all the contents of my stomach had been emptied, water was still coming out, and I was bleeding and in pain.

Since then, I have not touched sugar alcohols, but I have had diarrhea up to 10 times a day almost every day, usually after eating but sometimes it’s random. My stomach rumbles constantly and feels like it is “bubbling up” and then I get a sensation telling me I need to run to the bathroom immediately. There is still fresh blood on the toilet paper sometimes, and I think I’ve developed an external hemorrhoid (it feels like excess skin is coming out of my anus). I feel awful and I’m sure I must be dehydrated. 

I know I was stupid to keep eating something that bothered my stomach but I did not think it could do any kind of long-lasting damage.

I do smoke weed very frequently and drink on the weekends, but not heavily. I am currently taking adderall for my ADHD (10mg as needed) but nothing else. 

This started about 3 years ago. I have these episodes of uncontrollable vomiting and cannot hold anything down no longer than 10 mins. 3 years ago I was admitted into a hospital in Baltimore, was there for 2 nights so I saw 2 different doctors. One of them came in the middle of the night and told me my urine sample showed high levels of THC (I smoke weed regularly and have been for about 5 years). He said this could be the cause of my vomiting. Another doctor came in the next night and told me it was a “mild case of the flu”. 

Since then, I have been in and out of hospitals in Baltimore and Boston. Every doctor says something different. I have absolutely no idea what this is and how it can be stopped. 

I have missed school, work, and other activities due to this. When I have an episode it usually lasts around 24-48 hours. I can’t move or even bare to look at bright lights. I get shakes and sweats like you wouldn’t even believe. When an episode ends, it’s like nothing ever happened and i’m back to normal.

g66i1v,[24M] Is it okay to go back on my prescription Anti-Depressants when I haven’t taken any for a few months?,"I was on Sertraline 100mg or 120mg I think I can’t remember which. I know I was bumped up a few times. I was taking them for about 5-6 months and I decided to come off them as I was genuinely feeling a lot happier in general. Things were good for a month or so but some personal things happened and everything seems like it’s spiralling back to where it was before.  

I get bouts of really bad depression which then leads me to over-eat which then makes me gain weight really quickly (I used to be 19 Stone 11lbs but went down to 11 Stone 11lbs in about 8 months so my metabolism probably isn’t the greatest). Weight gain leads to shot confidence, anxiety and further deepens my depression which leads to more over-eating etc etc.  

I know I have some problems I need to address which the anti-depressants will not fix but I feel like they help me control other aspects of life a bit better which in turn helps me focus on the other areas I need to improve on.  

Anyway, the above is probably irrelevant sorry. The reason I am making this post is to ask if it would be okay for me to jump back on the anti-depressants after a prolonged period of time of not being on them? Sertraline is pretty common and they tend to hand it out like candy I think so I would assume it would be okay to request my prescription again but I wanted to double-check here just in case.

I have many medical issues that I was in the middle of getting diagnosed and treated for before I was dropped by my parents. Which included a brain lesion, migraines, seizures and low blood pressure. Now, I also had a ton of mental health issues that were really the bigger problem. Including PTSD, psycosis, memory loss (really bad blacking out) and general loss of function.

g689c8,what to expect after intentional overdose?,"i know this might be considered an emergency but i’m not looking for medical advice just a roadmap of what the next few days may have in store for me, so i hope this post is still allowed. i know i need to go to hospital but i decided not to and stand by that decision. 

2 days ago i (19F, 5’2, healthy bmi, caucasian, otherwise healthy if mentally ill, on 60mg fluoxetine) took 9g/18 pills of paracetamol, about the same number of pills of ibuprofen, like 8-10 amoxicillin, 8-10 of a random anti histamine, 14 (i think) naproxen. in total i probably took 60+ tablets. mum called police ambulance etc when she found my note, about 1 and a half hour after i started on the paracetamol and 10 minutes after i finished the random antihistamine i puked and voluntarily went home bc i figured it wasn’t gonna work anymore, but when i got home i took the naproxen. paramedics came to my house, tested my blood sugar, blood oxygen, heart rate, etc. all normal. they recommended i go with them to hospital and warned me that in the coming days my liver and kidneys may shut down resulting in death if i don’t get treatment. seeing as death is the whole damn point of this, i declined any treatment and there was nothing they could do legally to get me to have any treatment because i was within my own home, not being aggressive and of sound mind aside from the whole suicide thing. i spoke to a woman on the phone from the mental health team who basically told me i was just crying for help/attention seeking/didn’t know what i was doing. the best they could do is schedule a phone call appointment with the mental health team for tomorrow morning.

the first night i was vomiting relentlessly until i had nothing but bile to vomit and beyond. i was also incredibly fatigued. i spent the rest of the day extremely nauseous and hardly able to touch any food/drink, my last vomit was about 24 hours after the overdose and was triggered by simply drinking water. i also have diarrhoea and slight stomach cramps.

the second night i slept through and though i still feel a bit icky, i haven’t thrown up and i ate toast and then later dinner after about 48 hours of no food at all and kept it down. 

anyway from what i’ve read online this seems to be about the point where if liver and kidneys are gonna shut down they will. this is kinda something i would welcome, but i heard it can get real nasty.

i’m just wondering, does anyone have any odds on the chance of organ failure developing at this point? like is it almost guaranteed or is it a slight chance? like in people who od like i have what percent go on to develop kidney/liver failure? and from there what is the survival rate?

likewise, one particular thing that has scared the hell out of me when i’ve googled it is hepatoencephalopathy as a result of liver failure. does anyone know the chance of this happening and a potential way to prevent it. i want to die not sustain brain damage/become a vegetable.",1,15,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/g689c8/what_to_expect_after_intentional_overdose/"")",2020-04-22 13:02:49,Physician Responded

-medical history of heart problems (both my grandparents suffered a heart attack, one had it at 45 and survived, the other one at 66, and sadly he didn't) 

-for about 10 days or so I've experienced an increase in my heart rate every time I stand up, resting heart is anywhere between 55 to 85, depends on a lot of things, but soon as I get up my heart rate increases by 30/40 beats

-On March 8th I visited a cardiologist, I did an ecg, an ecg on a bike (stress test), a cardiac ultrasound and a regular medical examination, everything was fine and he didn't find anything wrong with my heart

Last night I felt a sharp pain in my arm that lasted the entire night and I felt pain in my left jaw. 

I was worried, so I called my hospital's non-emergency line, the doctor asked me to measure my blood pressure, and it was 150/100, she then asked me if I had chest pain, which I didn't, so she told me to try to calm down and took my number, she then called me 15 mins later and my pressure was 135/90, I measured it again after about an hour and it was 120/75.
She told me to call my doctor in the morning and ask for a Xanax prescription (I told her I suffer from anxiety)

Today I'm feeling pressure on the left side of my chest that comes and goes, it's not painful, it's just uncomfortable. I also feel a light pain in my arm that comes and goes and my hands are sweaty

I’m on amoxicillin for what my neurologist thinks may be a sinus infection, but he isn’t sure since the pressure around my eyes isn’t getting better and I already have epilepsy (which is why I went to him for eye pressure stuff). Earlier today I noticed my urine smelled strange (sort of like ammonia), I felt a slight burning sensation after urinating, and there was a dull pain in my lower left back. The strongest smell was in the morning, and the dull pain started a couple of hours later. It’s not even hurting really, just an ache dull enough to know it’s there. I try to drink water regularly and have been for the past couple of months.

I called him yesterday and told him about some other symptoms and he scheduled a CT scan for my head, but I called him today about this and he said to follow up with my primary care doctor. Didn’t tell me to stop taking it even though I’ve complained about side effects for 2 days now...

I tried to follow up with my PCP, but he isn’t currently taking patients due to COVID and the nurse practitioner is only in on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday. They’re also only taking well patients (they specifically said no sinus infections). The nurse from my neurologist’s office said it’s either side effects of amoxicillin or it sounded to her like a UTI.

I’m not completely sure what to do here. My PCP isn’t in and my neurologist doesn’t seem to care. Should I try to get to a different family practice doctor that isn’t my PCP?

g6asfg,[32M] Strange reaction to sunburn," 

Hey all. I'm an electrician and am outside a lot for work. About three years ago I got a very bad sunburn on my face and after two-three days a raised bump about the size of a thumb appeared on my forehead where the burn was the worst. It wasn't a normal post sunburn blister that is surface level. The bump was under the skin. After a couple more days it began to ooze a clear yellowish liquid and then finally went away after two-three weeks.

Ever since then whenever I get even a mild sunburn it pops back up. The strange thing is though that even when I'm not in the sun it can pop back up. I live in texas and a lot of my work is in unfinished buildings without a/c where it can be 100+ degrees easily. If there is a stretch of a couple days where it's really hot out it will pop back up even if I didn't get any sun. I've tried googling but everything it tells me is just describing regular post sunburn blisters. Anyone have any ideas? Obviously I can't afford to go to a doctor about this or I would.

In late-December of 2019, I had anal sex. We took a shower right after and I felt a lump outside down there. I had my partner take a look at it and it looked like stretched out skin and since we just finished anal sex, my butthole area was still sore and a little painful. He told me that there was already a really small lump on it before the big one came out. I think it would be one of the two on top. They look more like the skin of my butthole, but the one at the bottom still looks fresh and stuff so I guess the ones up top have been there forever.

I went to my uni’s nurse to get it checked and she said they are hemorrhoids. She recommended me Prep H, and I used it for a couple of weeks. So it was already January 2020 and it was still there, but no more sore or pain. It really barely caused me pain, it was more of the thought that it was there that bothered me a lot.

Fast forward March 2020, I felt the lump and it is still there. No pain, no bleeding, no itching. I would look up what hemorrhoids symptom are and they don’t really apply to me. I went to my doctor’s this month too and she said they were hemorrhoids but I didn’t realize she never said what exactly they ARE now. She told me to just let them be. But I’ve been letting them be for four months now and it’s been freaking me out. 

April 2020, I called her office and her front desk person told me that my doctor said since there are no signs of active hemorrhoid symptoms, they are skin tags. She recommended me to a GI. But since they are not seeing patients right now and only do telephone appointments, I didn’t think it was worth it. I should wait until I could go to the office. 

So that’s why I’m asking here. I have used witch hazel, epsom salt baths, and even tea tree oil. Nothing really helped it “shrink.”

Over the last year I have had a number of issues with digestion and had been diagnosed with proctitis alongside inflammation of the colon.

I've tried various treatments with limited success. It's not to the point that I can't function - but it has been quite distressing for some time. 

Over the last week I've had some symptoms that I haven't encountered before. I've had on and off again shortness of breath. Sometimes the bouts last two-three hours, sometimes it's twenty minutes. It's not unbearable, but it is actively distressing. I've had pain in the intestinal area, weakness/lethargy, more abdominal pain than usual, land more blood in my stool. Most of these symptoms are things i've had to varying degrees before outside of the breathing issues and the pain around the intestinal area.

If it is indeed GI bleeding what would the best course of action be?

I got it unofficialy because I had my blood tested at a place where I know someone who works there.

Fast forward to now, My feet sometimes have a tingling sensation to them, not often and it resolves within 10 minutes on its own. if I were to guess it happens once every couple of days. I also have lighter tingling sensations throughout the day but that might be me paying attention to something that isn't there. I am now also 17 kilos heavier than the bloodwork I had done before.  The reason why I'm asking here is because I'm pretty clueless whether or not to be concerned.

Hi all! I was prescribed bacterium on Monday due to suspected cellulitis on my face.

At this point I had no other symptoms, no swelling of lymph

Today I have a large, somewhat tender, swollen lymph right under my chin, on the right side. Its about the size of a cherry and kind of freaking me out. Could I be allergic to the Bactrim and thus should stop 2 days early (I was supposed to take 1 pill 2x per day, for 7 days)? On the plus side, the cyst/cellulitis spot is much better (almost 80% gone) and swelling has been totally eliminated.

I hope you are well

I turned 28 yesterday and the following events have happened this morning. Please any advice would be appreciated !! 

3am woke up with extreme crippling abdominal pain, I was on the toilet bent over, sweating feeling like I’m going to faint, crying out in pain. Feeling like I was going to be sick. 

4am I passed a loose watery stool which was then followed by about 9 little diarrhoea stools which weren’t really stools but more just amounts of Bright red blood.

Pain comes and goes like a wave over me. I can be fine for 20 mins then suddenly I can feel the pain starting in my top left hand side of my abdominal then radiates very quickly around the front of my abdominal, it’s very very quick and can last between 2-20 mins!

No prior medical history, no medications. But I do have an IUD.
I do not smoke, take drugs, or drink alcohol.

Hi, I hope everyone is staying safe out there. I’ll make this very quick because I just want a second opinion. 

~2ish weeks ago, I travelled (safely, to my cabin) and had become constipated for about 4 ish days. I didn’t think a lot of it because I have historically been 2 on the bristol chart and usually only went every 2 ish days. I travelled back home and used laxatives for 1 day, and an enema for another day, and was fine after. So that brings us to yesterday. I got a very very mild, achy pain in my left lower quadrant, just above my hip bone. I didn’t think much of it, but I took my stethoscope and auscultated the area, the sounds were a bit hyperactive. Later that night, I had the same pain very mildly again. I have since put myself on clear fluids. I have not had a movement for about 3 days now. I’m not vomiting, I have no nausea, and I’m still very much able to pass gas, and I don’t believe I have abdominal distension, my only concerns are the hyperactive bowel sounds and the constipation, although some constipation is normal for me. 

I wouldn’t normally ask something like this on Reddit, but with everything going on, I want to avoid the ED at all costs, as I have immunocompromised people in my home. 
Thank you, any advice is appreciated.

So I just called my urologist and let him know about what happened over the weekend by getting hit in the bladder and the office called back and said I need to go to the ER...even though I can urinate and don’t have blood in my urine. 

Is this normal?

I asked if they could order an Ultrasound of the Pelvis/Bladder and an MRI of the Pelvis Bladder (if that would be better) and they haven’t gotten back to me yet.

I noticed a black dot on my chest years ago (like at least 5 years ago) and whenever I squeezed it a hard string of white pus(?) came out. I didn’t think anything of it as it didn’t hurt at all.

In the last few months or so I noticed that the black dot has disappeared and it has formed a small, hard lump, the size of approximately a dime, in it’s place. 

I take 100 mg Spironolactone once a day for acne, 300 mg of Wellbutrin once a day, and a Yaz birth control pill. I have taken all these for less than a year. 

I occasionally smoke marijuana (like once or twice a month), I drink a beer or glass of wine a few nights a week, and I do not smoke cigarettes or do any other drugs. 

The thing that concerns me is my paternal grandfather had breast cancer in his 40’s and my father has regular monthly appointments with a dermatologist because he gets skin cancer that they need to remove a lot. 

Normally I would go to a dermatologist but I cannot do so right now because of the lockdown. 

I added an imgur link of the lump. It is kind of red and it is right above my finger. I would have posted a more zoomed out photo but it was removed initially for being too NSFW for imgur. As you can see, it is on the outer part of my left breast, right near the middle of my sternum.

Something weird started happening to me last year around april/may. I felt a deja vu accompanied by confusion, lightheadedness and chest pain/heart pang that spread throughout my whole body. It lasted only a few seconds but it left me with oppression and anxiety for some time after it happened. I could feel that it was about to start because I felt a normal deja vu, however as soon as the physical pains arrived, the deja vu morphed into a thousand images/ feelings that I thought  I had already lived. I also felt detached from reality. The thing is that when it stopped, I couldn’t really remember those images and I just felt a sense of confusion. It was a terrible feeling and it’s really hard to put into words. Also it happened when I was quite relaxed (e.g. on the train to school, reading something on the internet, when I was out with friends) 5 or more times a day. However, I have to say that I was going through a stressful time at school and that might have been the cause. I stopped having these episodes after a few months.
Now, exactly a year later, they’re coming back. I haven’t really experienced an episode as strong as the ones from last year, but I’m getting these deja vus and I feel that they could happen any time now. Today I felt the strongest episode yet and I’m afraid I will go back to experiencing them many times a day. The only difference is that this isn’t a stressful time for me, given that I’m at home and have a lot of time for myself. Does anyone know what these episodes could be? Is it anxiety?

As you can see I’m very low in fertility. Low mobility as well.

A casual hookup for the last year informed me she’s 1 month pregnant. She says I’m the father. She says she was on birth control (pill) the whole time and never missed it. She says there’s no need to get a DNA test since I’m the only one she slept with.

I see this three ways:

A. I’m the father, despite my fertility, and she was lying about birth control.

B. My fertility is so low that my chances of being the father are almost nil, request a DNA test.

C. She was on birth control, and despite my fertility, the absolute impossible happened (seriously astronomically small odds) and I’m the father.

gdykas,Glaucoma help,"Hi there!

My left eye is diagnosed with glaucoma and I lost nearly 70% of my my vision with that eye. I had already undergone the eye surgery to release the liquid out. The doctor prescribed me to use Brinzolamide eye drops for maintenance (to be applied in both eyes). Using that drug, both my eyes started feeling itchy, despite this, I continued using it and it reached to the point my eyes swelled. I immediately went to contact my doctor and learned I was allergic to the eye drop prescribed. The doctor changed my prescription to Lumigan (Bimatoprost)(still applied on both eyes), after 1 week, the swelling is gone and my right eye (the unaffected eye) felt so much better now. The left eye (eye w/ glaucoma), on the other hand, stopped swelling too, however it started becoming numb and my vision there started to dim. It is also very hard to open my eyes. 

I couldn't reach my doctor right now. What do you think could be happening to my left eye? I don't think it's allergy because my other eye isn't affected, but maybe it's possible? :(((

My wisdom teeth had all grow through around that time. I recently made a post about going to the dentist and they told me all 4 wisdom teeth are infected and have to be removed.

My dentist mentioned it most likely is the cause of how I feel. But I feel I've left it for so long the infection could have done more damage...

I'm scared the infection has most likely got to my brain as the dentist said it'd definitely be in my blood. 

Symptoms I'm a struggling with are:

Confusion and drowsiness constantly.

My moods are irritable and I'm not like that.

Have bad mental focus and really poor thought processing, like I can barely remember yesterday.

I feel physically weaker and exhausted most of the time.

I find it hard to speak and sometimes my words can be slurred.

I have an extremely still neck back and shoulders.

The focus of my vision is narrow and blurring sometimes.

Constant ringing in ears.

These are all also symptoms of brain abscess... I may be over thinking but I want to be safe than sorry!

ge676i,"Unmotivated and struggling mentally. 2yrs with Chronic upper back pain,","Hi Doctors,
I hope you’re all doing well. 

I’m posting this today for some advice. I (24F) 5’8’ and roughly 64kg (scales need batteries sorry) have been struggling with upper back, shoulder and neck pain for almost 2 years. 

A bit of a back story 
I have had anxiety since I was in high school. Specifically social anxiety. It comes and goes in waves of being in under control and times when it’s not. 
I also have past addiction struggles, I was very skinny but never really felt unhealthy or in pain. (I don’t know if this is relevant but I feel like drugs have bad effects so I should mention it) 
About 2 years ago I started to distance myself from that lifestyle and as expected, I gained weight. 
I have never in my life enjoyed exercise. I hate this about myself because I have a bad relationship with body image.  
I started to work from home, for myself so I know that a lot of my pain is caused from the way I look at my screen. 
About 12 months ago I moved interstate to completely get away from the lifestyle that was consuming me and to be honest. I’ve never felt so unhealthy in my life.  
My neck, shoulders and back are in pain and so tight every single day. Some days it brings tears. 
Just before Christmas I went to see a physio and I told him I knew that my problem was probably screen time and the fact I do zero physical exercise and I work from home. 

Leading up to this appointment I tried a few times but I just don’t have the motivation in my body. Ever. Since I cut down a drug that is so bad for me 2 years ago and eliminated it a year ago I feel no motivation. I’m always sad and my back just kept getting worse. 

No surprises when I say the physio told me I had to move my body. 
And for once, I was. I was doing okay. I was taking beginner pilates and yoga classes 3 times a fortnight. I know that’s not a lot of effort but it was a start. I didn’t hate it. 

And now Covid19 has me more cooped up then ever,  everything is shut and any progress I made is gone.  My back is so so tight and I’m in so much pain. I try and wear posture correcting straps which do help but only for a few hours a day before they begin to hurt. 
Raising my arms to stretch causes my elbows and shoulders to crack a few times a day 😬

I want to move my body because I’m in pain and because I don’t love the look of the body I’m in anymore. Even though I was underweight and unhealthy before- 18kg weight gain in 2 years is a lot for me to accept. Could this weight fluctuation also be contributing to my pain? I feel heavy and I slouch as a result when sitting around. I’m unmotivated. 
I don’t know how to get myself out of this slump I’ve been in for so long now. I had a brief 3-5 months of loving life but covid is tough. 
How do I tackle this? How do humans just force themselves to do something when they are in pain and just wanting to sleep all the time? 

And if I was to put some money aside and be able to see a professional, would you say a physio again? Or an osteopath? Or any other recommendations. 

Sorry if the information is written a bit chaotic or hard to understand- I’m not sure how or what to say/ ask

What happens once a tolerance develops?,"(23/F, 190 lbs, 5’4) In December, I was prescribed Vyvanse for BED (as a last resort,) and as it is the only approved drug for the condition. The medication has worked wonderfully for me, and I’ve lost around 40 pounds. I no longer think about binging constantly and I can eat 1,200 calories a day &amp; be satisfied. 

I started on 30 mg and increased the dosage as the effect wore off. I am now beginning my second month on 60 mg. I can tell it isn’t working AS well as it was, which is to be expected, but I try to stay on each dose until I can feel no impact at all. 

My psychiatrist told me that 70mg is the max dose, so I am wondering what happens once tolerance to that dosage develops? I am the first my psychiatrist has used this treatment for, so when I asked at my last appointment he said he would begin to look into it. I am not diagnosed with ADD/ADHD, so I couldn’t just switch stimulants. Any experience with this?

Some times it was just a little disturbing and some times it was horrible but it never really stopped until the other night. And btw, i went to hospital for that in first day. They did some blood tests and pee test. Those came out normal just some stuff were higher than normal value and some were lower but doc said it is not that important.

gf7hma,Cause of low estrogen? Pituitary rumor?,"What could be the root cause of low estrogen?

I've been seeing a functional medicine doctor who had all of my hormones, metabolic panel, heavy metals, mold, thyroid, etc tested. She told me what other docs have told me, my estrogen is way low - like menopause low, and it has been that way for a few years. My testosterone is on the high end. Low cortisol. Low insulin and normal to low blood glucose. I'm female, 23, I don't have a period. I got them semi-regularly until about 3 years ago, then they slowly came less and less. I haven't had one since last December and before that I had maybe 4 in the entire year. 

My progesterone is also low and my testosterone on the higher end of the spectrum. I have a positive ANA and a marker of 2 (normal scale is less than 1) for hashimoto's. Otherwise my thyroid levels are normal. Does that marker mean I actually have hashis? I’ve heard conflicting answers. 

I have a moderate elevation of alternaria alternata, a kind of leaf mold from what I understand. No heavy metals toxicity. She does not believe that I have PCOS and does not want to treat the autoimmune markers or the mold until after I raise my estrogen. She thinks that will make the other problems go away, though I'm more inclined to think the estrogen is a symptom rather than the root issue. She has me eating soy and taking saw palmetto along with something called FemPremenstrual on the 10 days before my cycle should start. 

I told her I have joint pain (bad enough I can’t sit for long periods and sleep is uncomfortable), stomach issues, depression and severe fatigue. I also told her that no matter how much exercise, weight training, HIIT or cardio,  I cannot improve my physique or feel stronger. I'm 110 lbs and 5'2"" so most doctors just tell me that I'm a ""healthy weight"", but I'm not comfortable nor do I look toned the way I should eating a very good AIP (sort of paleo) diet and exercising every day at a caloric deficit. Before I started feeling bad I was a steady 98-100 lbs. So far the treatment is doing nothing, in fact I've felt worse in the last month than I have in a while. I'm at my wits' end and I'm starting to feel hopeless that I will ever feel like myself again. Does anyone have any recommendations for me? Could this be related to a pituitary tumor? My options are to see a rheumatologist, get a pelvic ultrasound, or an MRI. I’m out of work though and it’s not like these doctor visits/tests are cheap.

gf9950,My mom might be getting scammed by a guy who claims to have severe cancer spreading all over his body," [https://www.reddit.com/r/medical\_advice/comments/gf96u3/mom\_may\_be\_getting\_scammed\_by\_a\_guy\_who\_says\_he/](https://www.reddit.com/r/medical_advice/comments/gf96u3/mom_may_be_getting_scammed_by_a_guy_who_says_he/) 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I realize how insane this sounds. I need someone to tell me if this is reasonable or if we should get my mom professional help. 

Okay, names changed for privacy. lets call this guy ""Tom"" from Virginia. 

So, my sister needs a kidney.  Tom saw that we had run an add looking for kidney donations for my sister. Tom said that it was a sign from God to donate his kidney to my sister. He is around 20 years old, has 2 or 3 kids and is married. Short story: He flew into our local hospital after getting and passing a various amount of testing in Virginia. HE SAYS that our local hospital told him he had severe kidney cancer. When my other sister (not the sick one) called to ask about this they said they had only found a spot on his kidney and had no other information.   NOW, he says that the cancer has spread all over his body. Last Thursday he went into surgery to get one kidney removed, 3/4 of one lung removed and something else. Now he says they have to remove part of his second lung and other kidney. I am pretty sure he had to get his testicals removed as well. Is it even possible to live with less than one lung even if it is 1/4 of each one?

​

ANYWAYS, my mom is the sweetest best woman on the planet and has been pretty much sucked up into his life and situation even though we have to take care of my sick sister. Tom is obviously young and not financially stable and she has given him money (Probably 2 or 3 thousand dollars total THAT WE KNOW OF) to help pay for his down payments at the hospital. She also talks to him for hours a day. Since May 7th, she has spoken to him for 8 hours. I just had to look up the phone records because I was that concerned. He sent her pictures of his wound from the hospital getting his kidney removed and sent videos of him walking around the hospital to pretty much my whole family. My sister and I think its probably a scam. He also said on top of all of this, now his wife is cheating on him and he has an STD. SO, now he is depressed because his wife is cheating on him and they are very religious and the priest said they should not get a divorce. 

​

NOW, even though he had MAJOR surgery and got at least 3/4 of his lung and one kidney removed, he is trying to drive here from Virginia to give them a TV. OBVIOUSLY, my mom sister and dad are social distancing because my sister is severely immunosuppresant. My mom tried to say that she was going to leave the house to meet up with him, but my dad said absolutely not since my sister could literally die if she caught COVID-19.

IN SHORT:

I am a 26f with scoliosis. I have had spinal fusion (T2-T12) at the age of 12 and had all my hardware removed at age 24.

gfda8a,"FML is this a cold sore? I've never had one before. If so, what do I do?","Pics [here](https://imgur.com/a/i8fnWHh). 

23F, 5ft5 150lbs, Asian, possible cold sore starting this morning, no other medical issues/medication. Am a smoker, not a drinker. 

Woke up this morning, felt a small bump on my lip. Sometimes I get teensy-tiny bumps inside my lip or cheek that I can pop by biting on it so instinctually I bit down on this bump and felt it pop with some fluid (no idea what it looked since I did this in bed, not looking at a mirror). Didn't think much of it at the time. 

Fast forward to this afternoon, looking at it again, it's more inflamed and a white bump is more visible now. Now I'm more worried and convinced it could be a cold sore. When I look at it closely, and hopefully the images help show this, it seems almost like a cluster of blisters under the main white bump - this seems like the most damning evidence.

I've never had a cold sore before; it seems a bit cruel and ironic that I contracted one during a time where I haven't been around other humans in 2 months (other than my boyfriend who lives with me) and cannot touch them/be near them, let alone kiss or share a drink with someone lol. Although I guess this may be something I've always had just laying dormant in my system. My boyfriend has never had a cold sore in his life either; he currently does not have one and we are avoiding kissing each other for the time being in case it is a cold sore. 

I didn't notice any tingling, itching or burning the day before, just noticed the bump when I woke up this morning. As of right now, it is pretty much painless; I don't think it's tingling? I put hydrogen peroxide on it around an hour ago so I think I occasionally feel a sting - though I don't know if maybe I'm just getting in my head and overthinking now.

My friend who has always had cold sores since we were kids said that time will tell especially if it breaks open and scabs over in the next few days but thought I would give it a shot in here too. I would also love any early, preventative tips or specific products I should get. I'm going to go out and grab what I can at the pharmacy to try and stop it in its tracks early, whether it's a weird pimple or a cold sore. Bonus points if it's stuff available in Canada as well.

As previously mentioned, I have already held some hydrogen peroxide to it with a cotton pad - is this something I should keep doing routinely? Based on some guides in r/coldsores, I also plan on icing it as often as I can. Should I try and pop it? In my opinion, this seems generally frowned upon across all types of pimples or lesions but I noticed that some guides in the cold sore subreddit swear by popping with a disinfected needle early on?? 

To be honest, for the past few hours, I've been switching back and forth between anxiety/dread/annoyance and acceptance/""I guess this is my life now.""

gh686m,Blood on toilet paper after BM,"32F

Height: 5’6”

Weight: 125 lb

Race: Caucasian

Primary complaint: Small amount of fresh blood on toilet paper after BM

Duration: Happened 12 hours ago 

Existing medical issues: Diagnosed with a litany of mental health issues (OCD, GAD, MDD, illness anxiety disorder). I have been diagnosed with hemorrhoids before (I’ve given birth twice) and have dealt with IBS on and off since I was 11. 

Current medications: 100 mg Zoloft per day. Occasional use of Zyrtec and Flonase if allergies are bad. I’m vegan so I supplement with Vitamin B12. 

I do not drink, smoke, or use recreational drugs. I am very active and do heavy workouts approximately 6 days a week. 

Ok, so COVID is preventing me from accessing my doctor as easily. I was fairly constipated and straining hard to have vowel movements for 48 hours prior to noticing the bleeding. Then I had a normal bowel movement (though noticed a slight tearing sensation in my anus when going) and when I wiped there was a small amount of fresh blood on the toilet paper. Nothing in the toilet bowl and I didn’t notice any on my stool.

After planning my funeral, I examined my anus and seemed to notice a small tear that was actively bleeding a small amount. It stung when I wiped that area with a tucks pad and there was a small amount of blood on the tucks pad as well after wiping. 

This morning I had another normal BM (still a small amount of anal pain) and there was less blood; just a faint amount. 

As I spend my Mother’s Day convinced I’m dying of colon cancer, does anyone want to tell me it’s likely due to a small anal tear that will heal with at home treatment? I’m doing Epsom salt soaks, prep H cream, and tucks pads. Hoping to do a Telehealth appt with my dr this week.

gh6ptj,Just pulled a piece of glass out of my foot that I believe may have punctured an artery in my foot over 5 years ago.,"M 30 years old 
165 lbs

About 5 years ago, I plopped down and sat on my knees quickly. Some pieces of glass were broken on my floor (I didn’t realize it until after the accident) and I sat on my feet and immediately got a jolt of severe pain in the top center portion of my left foot.

My sock filled with blood rapidly, and upon taking the sock off...blood began to squirt across the entire room. I’m talking like 6-10 foot spray across the room in full on heartbeat style. It was quite horrific at the time...and my girlfriend immediately sprung into action and got me a towel to hold on it with heavy pressure. 

We drove to the ER...but the bleeding had stopped and we decided it would probably be okay to just go home instead of sitting for hours in the waiting room.

I started to have what I though was scar tissue after a while...until about 2 months ago when I noticed my “scar” had busted wide open again while putting on a shoe. I noticed the wound was in the same place as my 5 year old scar tissue and immediately got a bit concerned.

It scabbed up...but the scab wasn’t going away. I began noticing that my scar tissue lump was gone and instead I had a scab that wasn’t healing. After a few times of looking at the scab under a light...I saw a bit of shimmer and immediately realized it may have been a piece of glass. 

Last night, I squeezed it like a pimple and heard a quick little pop. A piece of glass a little less that 1/16 of an inch surfaced from my wound and I managed to pull it out after 5+ years of never knowing any better. 

I sterilized it with alcohol and cleaned the wound but currently I’m just hoping I managed to get all of the glass out. 

Will it be alright to avoid the doctor over this issue, since my accident occurred over 5 years ago and it seems to have finally made its way out of my skin?! Secondly, what kind of health effects could this have caused over the course of healing? I’ve had many strange health issues like symptoms of Temporal Arteritis (which is very strange for my age) and lots of blood clot type issues that doctors could never sort out.

gh6zz1,Freaking out about dvt (picture included),"Hi,

Female, 24 years old, 5’7, 115 pounds? (51kg)

I had a pain behind the left knee, where the leg bends (in the picture at green) and the pain it’s been there for four days. 

It started with a pain where the leg bends, behind the knee. The feeling it’s like when trying to reach the toes not bending the legs or when sitting in the toilet for a while. The pain was like a two.

The pain intensifies a little when standing, gets slightly better walking and laying. If I lay on my stomach with the calves up, the pain is almost gone. 

The next day I woke up with no pain but after a while being up it started again, same intensity but now the pain radiated to the back of the upper leg and a spot of pain on the buttock. The more I stretch the leg, the more I can feel the pain.

The next day almost no pain at all.

Today I woke up with no pain but after a while being up, it came back. The intensity is again a two sometimes three. The main focus of pain is still behind the knee but it’s all throughout the leg, even the foot showed in the second picture (in the picture at green).

I’m not taking the pill, I’m not overweight but I’m sedentary and smoke about 5 cigarettes a day.

Because of the pain in the buttock, I thought about sciatic pain but I’ve read online about someone having the same pain and it being dvt.

The position that triggers the pain the most is being sitting without feet touching the ground. I’ve climbed stairs and walked a little and that didn’t seem to intensity the pain.

There is no redness, no swelling and the area is warm at the same temperature as the other leg.

I’ve read so many things online about people with this exact pain spots being dvt and otherwise that I don’t know what to do 

Is it possibly a dvt or a sciatic pain or something else?

Should I rush to the hospital? I’m freaking out

ghap62,Feeling defeated. Is this really just in my head?,"26 year old male; 6’2; 183 lbs; duration 2 months. 

I’ve been dealing with tinnitus and ear pressure (predominantly in my right ear) for two months now. My audiology report showed a 15db difference between my two ears, but since I’ve never had an audiology exam done before, we don’t know if that difference is “normal” for me. I was told though that the difference didn’t constitute hearing loss. Nevertheless, my ENT ordered an MRI just to be safe (however, he told me that I could wait until October after redoing the audiology exam). 

I suffer from pretty severe health anxiety and have been working on my anxiety over the past few weeks. Coincidentally, I’ve noticed that the intensity of my tinnitus has decreased. While the pressure and ringing are still there, I’m not focused on it as much, so it’s not as bothersome. 

I’m leaning towards getting an MRI without contrast this month and then getting an MRI with contrast if necessary after the audiology exam is redone. Could my tinnitus and pressure just be caused by something perfectly benign like allergies, TMD, stress/anxiety, or something like that? I almost feel like there’s a very real possibility of that because I’ve had numerous “health issues” over the years that have suddenly disappeared after moving on to a new worry. Just several months ago, I spent 5 or 6 months obsessively worrying that I had lung cancer and had intense right-sided chest pain. Exams didn’t reveal anything and once I moved onto this ear issue, my chest pain completely disappeared. I guess I just worry that maybe this is different because of the hearing discrepancy, but I did have so much anxiety during the exam that it was often hard to hear the sounds because my heart was beating so fast",1,11,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/ghap62/feeling_defeated_is_this_really_just_in_my_head/"")",2020-05-10 15:07:31,Physician Responded

ghq0vp,Older parents not being candid about Dad's heart issue - can someone help me understand the severity a bit better?,"I live about 400 miles from my parents. Respectively, they are 74 (mom) and 73 (dad). They're not the healthiest in the sense that neither one has a great diet or exercise regiment, but up until this point neither has had any major health issues.

Two months ago, my father (73 years old, 6'2"", 240lbs) was prescribed Amoxicillin for something. Maybe incidentally, maybe related, he started having weird symptoms almost immediately.  Insomnia, anxiety, difficulty breathing, tachycardia.

When he finished the Amoxicillin course, the breathing and heart rate issue continued, and he broke down and called a cardiologist. She saw him in the office and prescribed meds, but they weren't able to initially get him into the hospital for diagnostics due to COVID restrictions. The assumption was he had a blockage or something similar, and was possibly in need of a stent.

Two weeks ago he was taken to the hospital in an ambulance when he bent over and was unable to catch his breath at all after standing up.  They did the catheterization and found absolutely nothing they could repair.

My mother said, ""this just means his heart is weak, which can and will be treated with medicine. I'm taking this as good news.""

He is home again now.  The cardiac rehab facility is in the hospital, so is inaccessible until the COVID crisis is over. He is supposed to be walking for 10 minutes a day, but isn't.

My parents are nice people but are poorly equipped on an emotional front and have a tendency to sweep bad news under the rug in efforts to not ""worry people""... I suspect even if the doctor had told dad he had 8 weeks to live, they probably wouldn't tell me until close to the very end.

Requests for more details keep getting responses like, ""it's fine! the doctor just says I have to lay off the salt!,"" and ""he's taking all the medicine the doctor is prescribing, I'm sure he'll start improving soon.""

I'm hoping someone here can peek at his symptoms I'm aware of and guesstimate how bad a shape he might actually be in - I'm trying to figure out if I need to find a way home ASAP, or if this is something that I might be safe to be patient for real news from my parents on.

* He is currently taking Lasix, Metroprolol tartrate, and a blood thinner - possibly other things but it's difficult information to squeeze from my parents. He's been taking all these things for \~7 weeks and his condition has only worsened.
* They had to hold him in the hospital for 36 hours before they were able to do the catheterization because of the extent of his fluid retention
* He is sleeping on the first floor of the house because the stairs are too difficult for him to climb regularly.
* He's sleeping upright in an easy chair because when he lays down, the fluid in his chest makes it hard for him to breathe and he wakes up in a panic.
* About two week ago, he developed a pretty persistent
* He's having to take rest breaks while doing even very simple things, like getting dressed.

Although my dad refuses to admit the doctor labeled it CHF or graded it, to my non-medical self, that sounds like Stage C/D CHF.

 17 M When I was born a got a partial circumcision for medical reasons not relevant now. The problem was that the doctor fucked up. As it healed the bit of foreskin that I had left fused with the top of my penis. It was connected with a piece of skin 1 mm this and 5 mm wide. It stayed like that for 15 years. When I turned 16 I decide that I wanted a normal penis. So at night a prepared my stuf a tube of superglue to close the wound, a Swiss Army knife and some paper towel. I cut it of without local sedation (Fuck that hurt).
It all went well and in the morning it was done I had a normal penis. Now I ask if I might ever get any negative Side-effects because of this?

17F African. I've had this disgusting smell for so long. It's very noticeable, very strong. The smell is seriously concerning, I can smell it all the time.... imagine. Sometimes the itchiness, the discharge(right now, the colour of the discharge is green) and the smell decreases but it always comes back. I'm desperate at this point. 

I don't know if it's correlated but I've been experiencing stomach ache for a year (I got treatment for that, antibiotics in December for two weeks) and lately I've been experiencing back pain but only if I touch a certain place, it goes away and returns.

Also, I twice told my doc about this topic and she prescribed me, the first time she prescribed me an ovum and a cream (laurimic 20 grams of fenticonazol""said in Spanish"") and the second time  she prescribed me a lighter cream (5 grams, I think)  (4 months and 10 months ago) it did nothing.",1,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/ghtrzx/off_smell_down_there_for_maybe_5_years/"")",2020-05-11 11:50:39,Physician Responded

I had some blood work done today and the nurse had a hard time finding my vein (I’ve had blood work done MANY times with no problems). So she just went for this area where she thought she felt my vein. When she bandaged it I noticed the bandage didn’t cover the actual puncture but was just above it. Is this something I should be worried about? I’ve never had this level of bruising before (if any at all).

ghvex4,"I expressed myself badly to a psychiatrist and only realized later, which caused he to prescribe a medication for a problem i think i don't have.","I'm 18 years old, male. I never drank or smoked or used any recreational drugs. I'm taking bupropion for four days.

So, in the last friday, i went to an appointment with a psychiatrist because i think i might have ADHD and wanted to hear a professional opinion.

I explained to him that i was feeling like i was wasting a lot of time wandering around in my bedroom and that i was having a hard time concentrating in my studies, these things made me think of the possibility of ADHD. Then i said that i did a research on the internet and found out that i could have it, but since i recognise that internet is not so trustworthy and self-diagnose was a bad thing to do i decided to go after some professional avaliation. Also i analyzed in retrospect some remarkable moments of my childhood that could have been caused by the disorder (like the ungodly amount of times that my mother asked me to get something in the kitchen just to see me coming back empty-handed because i forgot what i should get, or the drawings at the border of every page of my sixth grade notebook).

He proceeded to explain to me that indeed internet researches could give a lot of false positives on mental disorders. Here is where the problem is: he then asked me if what was making me feel bad is the thought of wasting time wandering, and i responded yes. This is not the proper response since my utmost worry right now is not being able to focus on my studies since i just got into college and am not feeling like i'm learning much due to my lack of concentration. It has always been this way, but since last year it got worse.

I think that response made he ignore my other statements because he didn't adressed them, he said that what i have probably is not ADHD nor an anxiety disorder (the latter i mentioned earlier to him as a possibility) and prescribed me a medication with an ""dopaminergic"" effect, bupropion.

I am taking the medicine as he prescribed, but since i realized that my response was misleading i have doubts if i should continue.",1,15,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/ghvex4/i_expressed_myself_badly_to_a_psychiatrist_and/"")",2020-05-11 13:08:05,Physician Responded

Okay, so I developed these bumps and a painful lump that isn’t visible but definitely is under the skin covering a good portion of my lower armpit. I think I had a reaction to the baking soda in the new deodorant so I stopped using it a couple of days ago (I didn’t really notice it was an issue till it was this visible and hurt raising my arm). The other armpit isn’t as bad, but it did have a reaction as well. I don’t understand how your body reacts this bad to baking soda but doesn’t even react to aluminum! I put hydrocortisone on them because I read somewhere that it can turn into a bacterial infection? I’m not really educated on medical stuff so I’m not sure what to do and if this is serious enough to make a doctors appointment or if it will subside soon? What can I use to help make it better? Should I go back to using the aluminum deodorant? Sorry for so many questions, it’s just painful! Any feedback is very much appreciated, thank you!

gjnz31,Petechial rash; no pain/no itch,"Hi, 18M 191cm 92kg, no smoking/drinking/drugs. In terms of medications, I currently suffer from hay fever year round although I very rarely take meds for this; if I do it's chlorpheniramine (probably took about 4 tablets this year). I've also taken a few courses of antibiotics over the past year due to infections from an ingrown toenail (recently took one last week), probably 4-5 courses over the past year.

I've probably had this rash for a couple of months now, maybe longer but I cannot recall.

This is what is looks like: [https://imgur.com/a/aSEYW38](https://imgur.com/a/aSEYW38)

It's not itchy or painful and it feels smooth like the rest of my skin. It appears on both of my feet in exactly the same area and nowhere else; haven't noticed it spreading either. Went to the doctor 4 days ago to get it checked out; they did a blood test and came back with nothing. I'm also showing no other symptoms and told the doctor this, and he said he couldn't make a proper diagnosis at this point. Currently waiting for an appointment with another doctor however living in Hong Kong this could take up to a month if not more, seeing as my case doesn't seem to be serious.

If anyone has any ideas I would appreciate any help as I could not find anything online relating to this condition, as even though it hasn't spread it hasn't reduced in size either and makes me slightly worried.

A new, pretty elevated but small mole appeared near my groin about a week ago. I stupidly started picking it and caused it to bleed, now theres a pink area around it. I know bleeding and new moles can be signs of melanoma but Im pretty sure any mole would have started bleeding from that. I also had a weird mole-looking thing (1st picture) appear on my knee about a month ago but it disappeared after about a week and now theres just a tiny brown dot in its place.

SPD, ADHD (informally diagnosed due to age). No drinking, smoking, or drugs. 

In conferencing with her OT, I mentioned how unusually cold my daughter has been the last few months. Despite warm weather (upper 80s, low 90s), she would layer in long sleeves, pants, and still add a blanket or two. She went swimming on Mother’s Day and after about 30 min, her skin became mottled purple and sustained that look for a good hour or so, even after being wrapped and sitting in the sun. Her body was producing heat, but she still complained of being cold. Her body and face just didn’t look right, but she was acting normal. 

I reached out to the pediatrician to request an iron lab, which was ordered and completed yesterday. Her electrolytes, TSH, and iron levels are all in the normal range, though her iron saturation is on the high side of normal. Attached is the rest of her CBC and ferritin results. I’m hoping for someone to help me interpret and direct me in any concerns to bring up to her pediatrician when she calls.

gjsusl,Psychosis due to alcohol or prolactinoma?,"This post is about a 21 year old female (5'3"", 118lbs), living in canada, with no prior mental illness or substance abuse conditions, but has been diagnosed with a prolactinoma 5 years ago. She is a non-smoker, takes no medications for anything including her prolactinoma. 

I apologize in advance for grammar/spelling issues– still shaken up.

My sister, young 20s, has no prior history of mental health or substance abuse. In the past few days, she has seemed completely normal. As a university student, she drinks a fair share, and has never experienced anything like this. Her prior health conditions consist of a prolactinoma, which was diagnosed about 5 years ago. She tried medication in the first year, but felt that the side effects were too much. Since then, it has gone untreated.

Last night, she went to go see her friend for her birthday, and have a few drinks outside across a bonfire social distancing style. Again, I want to emphasize that in the past my sister has drank SIGNIFICANTLY more, and been fine. Her friends call us at one point in the night saying she's ""too drunk and needs to be taken home"". Upon getting there, she is completely delusional, trying to hurt us and those around her, paranoid and screaming that people are coming for her and that we need to run, and saying we are imposters dressed as her family and not her real family. Nothing calms her down, and she gets to the point where she is being extremely aggressive with us and putting herself and our life in danger so we call the cops and EMS. After 20 minutes (don't get me started, police took forever and that felt like a lifetime) she still hasn't calmed down and is still screaming the same delusions and trying to attack us (my dad is pinning her down at this point) the EMTs finally arrive, sedate her and check her in as a psych patient.

She is coherent, but groggy, now, and the psychiatrist has ruled out pre-existing mental illness. The psychiatrist says she believes it's alcohol induced psychosis, but I have a really hard time believing that as my sister is a frequent partier/drinker, and has WAY more alcohol in the past, and nothing even measurable to this extent has happened before. That is why my gut tells me that it is not due to the alcohol because she has drank WAY more in the past and never experienced anything like this. From my research I have read some case reports of prolactinomas being linked to psychiatric manifestations, like psychosis, but the psychiatrist is very dissmissive of that. (Note, she also has severe hyperprolactinemia as a result of her tumour). I am more inclined to believe it has something to do with her tumour, that may have been exacerbated by alcohol, rather than alcohol induced psychosis on its own.

I'm trying not to be a hypochondriac about it and my father told me it's not worth worrying about it this early, since he himself is hypochondriac and has lost a lot of time worrying for nothing.

Hi my names Ian and I’ve had Lyme disease for 3 years. It all started when I was in my living room watching a movie with my family. My face started to go numb and I was freaking out telling my dad I couldn’t feel my face. It disappeared the next day. My anxiety in general got worse from school and I started becoming sick more often. I was in ROTC at the time I kept getting sick. I thought it might have been the nicotine I’ve been smoking. But then symptoms got worse. One night I had a fever and I told my dad I need to go to the doctor, but he said sleep it off you’ll be bette Ron the morning. So he slept in the room with me that night. I woke up and I couldn’t move. I yelled out for help. I fell of my bunk bed. I felt so heavy and weak. I had to quit school, after going to several doctors I was diagnosed with extreme anxiety, and OCD. Then another doctor diagnosed me with Pans. They put me on a IV with steroids for 2 weeks straight. After things got worse and better. Symptoms would still be there but the extreme ones would come and go. I went back to school and finished my sophomore year. After that I got even more sick. And my dad gave up on me handing me over to my mom. They thought I was a lost cause. So I finally convict my mom to get tested for Lyme disease. It came back positive. I was so happy that I was right and we could move forward. But I was so wrong. We tried a riff machine, but that had no effect. We haven’t done anything since. And I want the next treatment. Ever since I’ve gotten sick I haven’t had a good day in my life. I know it sounds pathetic but i don’t have any friends anymore and I constantly cry myself to sleep trying to figure out how I’ll end my life. But the next day comes to distract me with video games and tv. Then night rolls around again, me not being able to ever sleep my thoughts race. And the cycle repeats about how I should end my life what note to leave etc. i want my life back.

I have a therapist. Because I can’t sleep I’m more vulnerable to getting depressed easily. But I pretty much have that under control now. 

Sleep paralysis affects me all the time. I’m tired constantly. Sometimes I can’t feel my fingers or my tongue. 

I would really appreciate some advice, thank you so much :)))",1,6,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gkbzk1/i_struggle_with_sleep_paralysis_any_tips_on_how_i/"")",2020-05-15 09:09:48,Physician Responded
gkc0yk,2L of water per day or not?,"17M but I don't think that's relevent.

Some people say to drink 2L of water per day and some people say that having a clear pee is a bad sign. Who do we listen?

Here's a little background if you want to read more:

Since it's quarantine and I have nothing to do, one day I looked up sites to help me stay healthy during a time you're not allowed to go outside. So the classic stay in chape and do physical activities (I try to do at least 4h/week) and eat healthy etc. But the water situation really caught my eyes because when I tried to remember how much water I drink per day I figured it's way less 1L. So I tried the 2L per day and now I can go to the bathroom 2-3 times PER HOUR and almost everytime I go my pee is close to crystal clear. Is this normal? should I keep drinking that much? is this unhealthy?",2,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gkc0yk/2l_of_water_per_day_or_not/"")",2020-05-15 09:11:53,Physician Responded

gkggcj,"22F 5'9"" 145-150(?) lbs feeling very faint every time I stand up","For the past few months (at least since lockdown began mid-March) I've been feeling extreme lightheadedness and dizziness when I stand up, both from lying and sitting positions, though mostly lying. It usually lasts about 10+ seconds during which time my vision is almost completely clouded with stars so that I can't see, and I have to concentrate on holding onto something so that I don't lose my balance while waiting for it to pass. On a few occasions(such as today, twice), I've had to lay back down because the dizziness was so intense and long lasting that I didn't want to risk falling and hitting my head or something until it dissipated. It's become a habit for me now to get up in stages, from laying to sitting for a few seconds, and then slowly up to standing after that.
I began changing my diet toward a more healthy one, and for the past three weeks, it's mostly comprised veggies (like broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, onion, spinach, bell pepper), eggs, small amounts of dairy (cheese, cottage cheese), and chicken liver to help up my iron levels. I've also made an effort to be more active, averaging 5+ miles of walking a day. I have also been conscious of my hydration levels, only experiencing dehydration upon waking (my morning piss looks like damned lipton tea, but thereon after nearly clear). My sleep schedule has been much more regular, about 9-10 hours of decent sleep during the day. Despite these changes, I have not noticed any improvement.
I'm also finding that lately I've been experiencing slight nausea for no apparent reason. I feel like I have a lot of brain fog, and often times I forget things as soon as I hear/read them, have trouble focusing on conversations, and can't formulate coherent thoughts in writing adequately. I don't take any medications or have any known conditions, and I rarely if ever take any type of drug (namely caffeine and alcohol).
As for menstruation, my cycle hasn't changed much. It occurs about every 3 weeks with medium flow (at its heaviest) for a week. I haven't noticed any patterns that correlate with my cycle.
I have not been to a doctor regarding these issues due to the termination of my insurance right after lockdown as well as a complete lack of income since then as well.

gkhm2t,I'm worried that I've ruined my future,"18[M] So I'm kind of new to this but I'm really just looking for some comfort and support because idk what to do and feel like crying. So I recently started becoming sexually active this past school year(first year University) and as a gay guy, I explored with bunch of guys and stuff. I always made sure I used a condom(except for the few instances, of oral sex when I started off) but after that I used condoms and always asked about their sexual status and everything. I did many different things from like giving oral to recieving and full on anal and once all was said and done, I always got tested after every encounter. As for my body count, I had encounters with about 15 ish guys(idk if that's too high, if so please dont judge me, I come from a conservative house and was just really curious). So I thought I was doing everything right, I always got tested and everything always turned out negative. However I recently found out that theres one STD that I might not have accounted for, which is HPV and apparently it can cause cancer in the future and a person can pick up multiple strains of it. So now in basically freaking out and in the midst of a full blown break down because I feel like I've ruined my future now because of how I may have picked up the virus. I feel like in fated to die at the age of 27 because the cancer takes decades to fully develop, but nonetheless I feel screwed. I feel like I'll never grow old and have kids and just die at such a young age. I'm currently spiraling into a depression and feel like killing myself because I feel like such a disappointment to myself and my family for having put myself in this situation. And I also learnt that guys are more likely to develop throat and mouth cancer from it, which is very hard to treat and have a slim survival rate.

gkhn2d,Heat rash everyday,"Hi there. I'm a 25 year old female living in NYC. I don't know my weight at the moment but I am overweight. A few years ago I started to get itchy rashes fairly often, mainly on my legs, face, and arms, so I went to my PCP. She said that it's probably heat rashes and I should take an antihistamine as often as I need to. So for the last few years, I've been doing that - taking an antihistamine as needed. I usually only get them on a hot day in summer or in winter when the heat is blasting in my apartment (our landlord controls it not me) and the air is really warm and dry and stuffy.

But I've been getting them everyday lately. It's fairly warm in my apartment, but nothing crazy I mean I don't even feel that warm when they start to break out! The severity of these rashes have gotten worse, tons and tons of raised skin color bumps cover basically my entire upper arms. They are very itchy and hot to the touch. My roommate said to me today ""if I had a rash that bad I would goto the hospital and yet you're just so used to it daily."" I can link photos. I've always had a naturally warm body temperature but it's just crazy the heat that my arm are giving off. It doesn't seem normal. I'm trying to eat low-salt to keep my body temperature down but at the current moment I don't have time to cook so I order in a lot.

I will goto a derm when quarantine is over but I wanted to ask you guys, does this sound like heat rashes or something else? Is it normal to have huge rashes everyday? Is there a specific type of antihistamine I should be taking? Any foods to avoid eating? Thank you guys so much. &lt;3",1,12,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gkhn2d/heat_rash_everyday/"")",2020-05-15 14:12:34,Physician Responded
gki61l,How to help my (27M) boyfriend’s severe allergic reaction?,"Before everyone says to go to the ER, that’s not going to happen. His health insurance sucks and a several thousand dollar bill would ruin our plans to move and start school in a few months. This is what he said, not me, and I know it’s pointless to try to convince him otherwise unfortunately. I’ve already tried taking him to the hospital. He’s not nervous and has gone through this before but this time seems a little worse so I’m more nervous. 

He’s allergic to nuts and I stupidly fed him pesto. Immediately, he felt his tongue swelling and within 2 minutes was red and wheezing. I said let’s go to the hospital, but he told me to calm down, it’s worse than it sounds, and he’s been through this before. We got him Benadryl and it helped. But he still has been bright red, has thrown up several times, is itchy all over, super nauseous, has sharp pain one spot in his chest, a swollen throat, random chills, and slight wheezing. He seems to be over the hump but is very nauseous and drained. I’m thinking it’s going south in his body and may start to come out his other end soon. As much as I want to take him to the ER, he refuses and he’ll be fine, but it’s just going to be shitty for a little while. I’m not sure he threw up the Benadryl but there’s definitely a chance because he puked a little a few minutes after he took it. 

I looked through our medicine cabinet and found a couple things that may help. I have odanestron 4mg (for nausea) and prednisone 20mg, (which I looked up and can be used to treat sever allergies and immune system issues). Would these be safe to give to him? He took 2 Benadryl tabs (diphenhydramine 25mg) that he may have thrown up.

There is also some puffy, red, sore skin on the bottom of the door that he says hurts so bad he can’t walk on it. It’s all located in the arch area. His right foot doesn’t have any broken skin, but it does have one of the reddened, puffy, sore areas. He says it starts with the redness and then progresses to the broken skin.

2 years ago I had gotten scabies at a salon I worked at and it was a nightmare it kept coming back and I felt like we couldn’t eradicate after 6 months things started looking up. And  no more rash or bumps. 
I suffer from severe eczema on my hands and inner elbows My Dr told me because I suffer from the skin condition I would have lasting effects from the cream we used so I just  never thought anything of it after she cleared us.  

But recently and for the past year I’ve notice on my husband he will get large pimples on his back that have a white head but never pop easily and they usually just go away on their own. 

Again Dr said we were all good and if anything pops up just use the clobetasol on the breakout that it’s probably just a reaction to the prescription cream...So I just thought it was acne. 

The past week his back has been getting bad and yesterday he worked outside all day and over killed in the heat (sweat a lot) and started developing this rash and now today it’s spreading to his chest and shoulders. 
I’m so scarred from our scabies situation and  we recently lost our health insurance due to covid so I’m just trying to get some answers before we go to the ER or DR.

This has been the thing that has gotten far worse over time. From some googling the closest 'effect' that I could find was something called blue field entoptic phenomenon.

It is now constant, to the degree where it looks like there are flies buzzing around everywhere in my periphery vision

I've also been having some strange distortions, when I look at something, it starts to shrink or expand (usually shrink), and leave a recurring image of it like a tracer.

I know that's a lot of stuff but I'm just wondering if it can be pinned down to anything specific, it's really starting to affect my quality of vision now just because of how distracting it can be

I didn’t know I was pregnant until 3 days ago. I’ve always had an irregular period. Birth control always made me severely depressed so I got off of it. This wasn’t planned but I am really concerned because I know adderall isn’t good for pregnant women. 
I am waiting on my referral to be approved by my insurance to see an OB. I found a place and got an ultrasound and the technician said everything looked normal but that she was not trained to evaluate that kind of thing.
Also, I am currently taking classes which are now online. My finals are on June 1st, if I didn’t already harm my baby, would taking it until then do much more damage?

gl1cvv,Incorrect Chemo Dosage,"Hi everyone. 

I am here because my husband has bladder cancer. He has been undergoing chemo since March. This next week was suppose to be the 12th week, and final infusion.

This week, we received a strange call from his oncologist's office. They said the Dr. needed to speak to us. Due to coronavirus, most office visits have been over the phone, so this one was scheduled the same way. They told him that I should be present on speaker for this one and that everything was ok, not to worry, but the Dr. needed to speak to us about his dosage.

I knew right then what was wrong. Not that I am an expert, and not that my husband hasn't suffered, but it just seemed ""too easy"". We both thought he would have been much sicker with the chemo. We even told them in the beginning, before they stopped in office visits, that we had expected everything to be much worse than it is.  

We scheduled the tele-visit appointment for a few days later. During the call, the Dr. explained that the dose my husband was given was incorrect. It wasn't enough. Apparently, the Dr. wrote it down correctly, the NP, using some template, made an error, and the pharmacist didn't catch it either. He has had seven infusions. No one caught the error. No one. 

He said this has never happened to him before. We could tell, and he may have said it, that they had no idea what exactly to do. He said my husband would have to have more treatments now. His surgery, of course, will be postponed. He brought up the option of radiation, which he was very against during our consultation visits with him. He said by the end of the extended treatments, he will have received more than what he should have to begin with. 

We have an appointment with the Dr. next week, and the post chemo CT scan has been rescheduled for sooner. He said to come prepare with questions. I have no idea what to ask. Of course, how did this happen? How does this affect him? Is having extra sessions going to impact him negatively? What else? We are just so lost now.

gl2yc4,With pics: Bruise-like spots on calves that don't go away?,"Hello, I'm 37F 165cm x 63 kg white, don't drink don't smoke no drugs whatsoever. No existing medical issues other than the one I'm asking for advice here. I have done a complete health check up, including blood and urine tests 2 years ago, clean bill of health. I walk from 5 to 10 km per day as my workout.

It's about the blood circulation in my legs, especially my calves. It started 5 months ago with some itching and pulsating sensation on the right one, and then a 1 cm bruise-like spot appeared on the inner part of the calf, painless, but it doesn't go away, and I had a sort of throbbing pain 5 cm below it. I have a very light skin and veins are usually visible, but the veins above it (mid calf to knee) are now more visible. Now a similar spot appeared on the other calf, always on the inner portion and mid-way from ankle to knee, and it is the same. Once I walked a lot to exercise and the spot on the right one turned into a little spider web of veins, but usually looks like a reddish bruise. On some day, for some reason, the reddish spot disappears or become much lighter. I also feel some discomfort on the inner left tight along the line of the vein near the groin. When I go walking sometimes I feel pain in the lower inner quarter of the right calf, below the spot, as if there is a sore/hard muscle beneath, but just there.

I went 2 months ago to visit a qualified angiologist who did a kind of ultrasound test (the one with the gel, similar to the one for pregnant women) along both legs and said that there is nothing wrong, just a ""clinically irrelevant"" slight insufficiency on the valve at the left leg-groin junction (sorry for my rudimentary language) that he noted only because the instrument is very sophisticated (his words). For the spot on the leg (there was only the right one) he offered to close the veins in the leg with injections, as there is no other solution. I have been told to use those creams for heavy legs in summer or those stocks that help circulation and those pills with no prescription needed for peripheral circulation, but I have seen no changes whatsoever using them.

I don't want to close the veins if they don't cause problems, but I'm scared that the second ""bruise"" appeared on the left calf, and in general I have no clue what's going wrong with my legs since I have not changed my lifestyle, I really want the two reddish spots to go away without touching the blue veins, and I am terrified that there might be something wrong degenerating with my legs. Also I am 37 not 73, with a good health, so it scares me. Do you specialists have an idea of what could be my situation? Many thanks.

For a bit of background: My dad (48) was admitted to hospital with covid-19 for a few days, and is now home and recovered short of a persistent very high resting heart rate (110-130bpm). This is being investigated, waiting on blood test results. 

He is a doctor, so owns 2 pulse oximeters. Out of curiosity, myself (18M), my two sisters (early 20s) and my mum (47) tried one on this evening. We all had extremely high resting heart rates. This was confirmed by the second one and a manual count, so unlikely to be faulty equipment. My sisters were both 95-105, my mum 110, and myself 110 (my sisters both are short and slim, my mum and I have a bit of weight to us).

For context, my mum says she used a pulse oximeter after my dad did a few days ago and she was at her normal 65-70. My usual heart rate is ~80 (unfortunately unfit). None of us have a history of heart problems and to my knowledge no one is on medication that could effect it. None of us are heavy drinkers or smokers.
Should we be worried? My idle speculation is perhaps we've all had covid-19 more mildly than my dad, or perhaps CO poisoning?? We have a CO detector that has not gone off.

Thanks for any advice.",2,10,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gl3kuu/every_member_of_the_household_has_an_extremely/"")",2020-05-16 15:19:18,Physician Responded
gl3qbc,Have I developed Chron’s disease or some other bowel syndrome/disorder?,"So I’m a 20 year old woman of African decent. I’m 150lb and 5’7. 
Digestive issues in the past - I’ve had mucous in my stools for a pretty long time, and I take iron tablets which sometimes give me black stools. History of constipation.

I’m often quite constipated and this is something that I get from my mum’s side of the family (we have a history of acid reflux and constipation) so constipation doesn’t alarm me and I know how to handle it.

However, recently, I’d say since the coronavirus lockdown started I’ve been getting bouts of Diarrhea which is bizarre for me because normally, I’ll get Diarrhea around 4 times in a whole year. It’s not common for me.

Around late February I had Diarrhea twice in 2 days, I thought it was odd but moved on. Then, one day in early march I randomly got a pain in my stomach and had to go to the toilet then I felt better. Again, this kind of urgent toilet going never happens normally for me.

Then, more recently I’ve been really going through it. I had online exams on the 5th of May and had Diarrhea about 2-3 times that day, I put it down to nerves even though I don’t normally get full blown Diarrhea due to nerves. When I’m nervous my stomach might hurt for a bit but that’s about it.

Then, I was fine for a week and I had online exams again on the 12th May. Two days before the exam I had Diarrhea and then on the day of the exam I had a really unsettled stomach. Every time I ate I got an ache and discomfort in my stomach. I wouldn’t call it pain though.

I felt fine again and now it’s Saturday 16th May. I’m currently on night 2 of my period and most of the cramps are gone but I still have a decent amount of blood flow so it’s still definitely heavy/moderate. I’m mentioning this because maybe it’s got some relevance as I’ve heard period hormones and chemicals can cause more bowel movements and Diarrhea in a lot of people? Normally on my period I do get the ‘period poop’ but it’s usually normal stools and not watery Diarrhea. 

But basically I had a barbecue with my family at around 8pm today. We had lots of chicken and pies and only drank water. It wasn’t the first thing I ate though, I had 4 slices of toast for breakfast and a cup of tea. This is normal for me.

But as soon as I finished eating the barbecue food my stomach started to cramp badly and I had to go to the toilet. Sorry if it’s TMI but I had terrible Diarrhea, watery. Most of the Diarrhea I’ve had in recent weeks was watery. The stomach pain was awful and I’m just terrified at this point. This keeps happening and I feel like I can’t eat without having to take a crap.

I’m just wonder what is wrong with me. Early adulthood is around the time Chron’s disease starts isn’t it? Could it be IBD? IBS? Something else? Something sinister? I’m extremely confused and scared. I would see a doctor but coronavirus means I can’t see a gp, I’ll call the practice on Monday but I don’t know how much they can do over the phone.",2,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gl3qbc/have_i_developed_chrons_disease_or_some_other/"")",2020-05-16 15:28:24,Physician Responded
gl3vhr,"chapped lips my entire life, derma wants to do an expensive biopsy? why?","  height 5'3, weight 115, female, no meds, smoking none, live with a smoker tho, only this medical condition, duration is most of my life, lips, 

So title says it, I've had chapped lips basically as far as I can remember, it's mostly in the inner portion of the lip, always in the same place. First it seems normal, then it starts creating a skin, not noticeable but I can feel how it kind of ""bubbles"" when i press my lips together. Then it starts to peel, no matter how it peels, it always come back exactly the same. I've tried every home remedy and chapstick, aquaphor, Vaseline whatever, so I don't need any of that because that 100% won't help. Any comments that give that advice i dont need it.

I went to a dermatologist and he diagnosed it at first as a contact dermatitis, then as a irritant dermatitis. I'm in contact with nothing on my lips, because I'm only putting the steroid he gave me on them, so I feel he is wrong. He prescribed two tropical steroids that didn't work, hydrocortisone 2.5% and triamcinolone 0.1%, after the first saw no change, also they are both in the clear ointment version. They both don't help and I dont see any results.

He wants to do a single skin biopsy, now I have no medical knowledge on that, so I would love some insight. It's going to be expensive for me, so I really need to see results, is that possible? is there a chance I could get no results from it? I really need to stop putting money into this situation. thats the main concern I have, is that what if it shows no results, what then, everything I've ever tried has failed, and I'm not even sure the dermatologist really knows what this is, i feel like he gave the wrong diagnosis in the first place, and I don't trust his judgement on this so I need informal second opinion here.

Also, why would he go straight for biopsy? what will it prove and show? I highly doubt this will do anything, since his other attempts and diagnoses were a failure.

How would I get a second opinion without paying 100+ for it?

But sometimes I feel like he hates me. I often feel disconnected from him and everything. Sometimes when he cries it takes me a few minutes to be able to respond. Sometimes I feel like having him was a mistake, even though I would probably not have a life worth living if it wasn't for him. I feel like a failure because he'll only sleep with me or somebody in my family, or in the bed with me. He will not sleep alone. He purple cries if I put him in his crib, even if I'm in the room with him singing to him. Sometimes I just don't want to deal with him, as he's a pretty fussy boy about everything. I cannot calm him most the time, and usually it's my Mom who has to calm him or get him to sleep. I constantly wish I had the freedom to do whatever I want, like his father who left me. My family is supportive, but lack sympathy and compassion for how I feel. It's a hard feeling to describe but I'm not the happy mom I want to be. I feel hopeless and lost and unworthy of raising him.

Found small ulcer like sores inside the lips of my vulva when I was about 9 - no memories of abuse - is there something else that could’ve likely been the cause?

I remember there were multiple small (3-5mm maybe) sores that seemed to have formed out of no where and were quite painful. I was too confused and ashamed to speak to any adults about them. I seem to have a sense they came back on n off for a bit but eventually went away. 

I don’t test positive for any std’s as an adult. 

I’m basically trying to make sense of my life here, because this memory has been coming up in therapy that I am doing to heal from adult experiences of sexual violence.

gmr59q,Left knee pain while jogging. Provided MRI pictures.,"I am grateful for this wonderful subreddit. Looking forward to solving my problem.

Male, 24 years old. I had no injuries in the past. Two years ago (summer 2018) my knee started to hurt after long periods of sitting in front of a computer. The pain (discomfort) was sensible when walking and sometimes when balancing on one leg. It was positioned above the kneecap and under the knee. [This picture](https://imgur.com/ypKllAZ) shows the place of discomfort. 

I think it's worth mentioning that since 2012 my left knee was making noise (pops) while doing squats and bending the knee. I used to play soccer until 2018. I also have left-sided scoliosis. 

My doctor sent me to an orthopaedist and to X-ray. Orthopaedist checked if my knee can bend easily and did some other tests. He didn't find anything wrong about my knee and suggested doing exercises for proprioception.

X-ray diagnosis said: 

&gt; ""osteolytic change (radius 5 mm) in the right root of the proximal tibia - for further diagnose"". 

So, at my second visit to an orthopaedist, he sent me for MRI. MRI diagnosis was:

&gt; There are no changes in the skeleton, meniscus, ligament and musculo-tendon apparatus or joint surfaces. There is no pathological increase in the amount of tidal flow in the joint cavity.

My orthopaedist was perplexed that there was no flaw found in MRI. Although, he didn't check pictures himself. [Here are pictures from my MRI](https://imgur.com/a/9874Kw4) with censored private information. He suggested that I should do exercises. 

During this time, from summer 2018 to beginning of summer 2019 when I had an MRI, I was playing football once a week. My knees hurt almost every week. Sometimes I had a problem with quadriceps. My left knee was still popping and making noises when bending it. 

Since summer 2019 I was not doing any serious sports. I was walking frequently, cycling on the stationary bike, but it was not 100% effort. Fed days ago I started jogging, slow speed, and short duration. My first jogging session was great in terms of effects. The next day my knee was not popping while bending leg. Next jogging sessions I started feeling slight pain. Today pain was so sensible and the difference between left leg and right leg was big. 

What should I do about it? Doctors couldn't diagnose it correctly. I suppose its muscle problem. The only option I see is going to physio. 

What exercises should I do before getting a visit to physio? Can I still do my jogging while feeling slight pain and discomfort?",1,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gmr59q/left_knee_pain_while_jogging_provided_mri_pictures/"")",2020-05-19 08:50:54,Physician Responded

The throat swab was very painful to do, seemed to scrape my throat and caused gagging. The pain in my throat started from the first swab and the gagging caused them to mess up the swab and it had to be redone and they had to swab, and therefore gag, three times. 

My chest now hurts from the gagging and my throat is very sore and painful, and seems to be producing mucus that I can't clear now. And my stomach hurts from the gagging and is bringing up acid. Can throat swabs be painful? NHS website seems to indicate that they are totally risk free

I've recently had my stomach acid tested with a tube down my nose for 24 which causes gagging but it wasn't anywhere near as bad as this.

This is something that has been going on for years and not one doctor I've seen has been able to tell me what's going on.

A few times a day I will be doing something (nothing seems to trigger it, just happens) and all of a sudden I start to lose hearing (sounds like everything is muffled or underwater) and my eyes start dilating and undilating kind of in a rhythmic pattern. I get a bad headache and dizziness and usually have to sit down. Sometimes I will also get a rapid heart beat and/or chest pain. This passes in about 2-3 minutes and I feel perfectly fine until it ultimately happens again.

Do these sound like seizures? This started happening way before (like years before) I started taking my meds, so I don't think it's a med reaction.

Now I've developed petechiae on my breasts that's not going away. I have an appointment with my PCP tomorrow, but everything I read points to leukemia.

For the past 5 months or so I've noticed my nails gradually becoming more dry, brittle and lifting off the nail bed. This is happening to all my fingernails and toenails. It is mildly painful at times. I got tested for anemia, hyper/hypothyroidism, B12. All fine. I don't know why it is happening or how to stop it. I did move to a new apartment in January that has extremely hard water and that's when I first noticed it. Since then I have been taking less showers/baths, wear gloves when washing dishes, but obviously due to Covid-19 need to still wash my hands often. I can't be sure if it's the water that is causing it, or if the process started before I moved.

Taking D and B vitamins, antidepressants, adderall, and glycopyrrolate (for hyperhidrosis)

I've had shakiness in my hands and my legs, but it's most noticeable in the hands. Like as I write this my fingers are hovering over the keys and they're shaking a little. Another example is cutting vegetables this morning (this one might be attributable to hypoglycemia because I hadn't eaten yet). Basically fine motor skills I think are affected. I'm sure it could be related to anxiety but I shouldn't be anxious as much if I'm alone cutting veggies or typing, hopefully. I cut out diet and regular sodas at the beginning of the year but started drinking it again in March. During those 3 months though I was still experiencing the shaking.

I've had episodes of hypoglycemia and this feels different than that. I don't feel the general weakness with this. I first complained to a doctor about it in March 2018 who gave me an A1C test. I remember the doctor said ""you're not diabetic. You're not even pre-diabetic."" I'm looking at those results now and it says the value is 5.5 with a range of 4.2-6.5. I was 288lbs at that time and my eating (and weight) has improved since then. I have blood results from April 2020 that may be helpful too.

I used to chalk up the ED issues to alcohol, but it persisted after I quit drinking. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression 17 years ago, and although medicated for a while back then, I haven't been for a quite some years.

My doctor suggested I go back on depression and anxiety meds, to help with some persistent anxiety issues as well as the ED. Here's the order of things we tried, which helped with my mental health but not ED.

1. 20mg Prozac (this made me feel the best, but was bad for ED).
2. 10 mg Prozac (minor improvement in ED).
3. 10 mg Prozac + 300mg Bupropion (this so far has been the most successful, I can get an erection 50% of the time). I wanted more than 50%, so we tried:
4. 5mg Lexapro + 300mg Bupropion (this has been unsuccessful, I'm on this now with a 0% success rate).

The next thing my doc wants to try is Buproprion + buspirone.

My last scan was a CT 3 weeks ago and as of this week I’ve a migraine for three days. It was preceded by my usual visual aura, but it also wakes me up at night, which is not normal for me. That got me thinking that maybe this time it’s caused by a tumor developed due to the radiation.

The report from the radiologist who interpreted the ultrasound says:
1. thyroid is normal with no discrete nodule or calcification
2. Patient localized a palpable abnormality at level 6 just to the left of midline. This is an ovoid hypoechoic mass with a cluster of calcifications, medially. This mass measured 1.7 x 1.0 x 1.2 cm.

I also had thyroid blood work which came out normal. 

I know it's impossible for anyone to predict the result of the FNA but I'm curious roughly how often this turns out to be nothing, ie on a scale of no big deal to dancing pallbearers meme, how bad does this situation sound to you?

gonb4z,Is this worth seeing a doc over?,"I am a 22F. I’ve had issues with my knees since around middle school, when I started getting into sports more. In high school I got heavily into track and field and started having further issues with my knees. I saw a doctor when I was a sophomore (I think?) and was told I had patellar tendinitis and needed PT so the pain and damage didn’t get any worse. Well, at the time my parents didn’t want to pay for PT so I finished my high school sports life with wraps and knee braces for support. I didn’t have as much trouble with my knees when I was running, depending on the distance but I had a lot of pain as a discus thrower. I don’t do sports anymore so I figured it wouldn’t be bad since I wasn’t using my knees in that way anymore. 

Anywho, I’m 22 now and obviously out of high school and my knee pain and stiffness is getting progressively worse. I don’t work in a highly physical environment but I am up and down and on my feet for most of the day. My knees are never without pain. It doesn’t matter if I’m standing or sitting or in any position, they always hurt. Granted, the pain is maybe about a 2 on the pain scale most of the time so I just deal with it. When it’s cold out, the stiffness and pain gets much worse, pain going to a 4-5. The pain and stiffness also gets to that level when I’ve been squatting and using my knees more. Aside from the pain, my biggest concern is that I can’t go down stairs safely or comfortably. I have to hold onto the side rails for dear life because my knees shake and seem like they just can’t physically support my weight. They’ve given out on me a couple times while going down stairs and that was enough to scare me into avoiding stairs as much as possible but sometimes it’s just not applicable to not use stairs. I’m just very worried about them giving out on me at the wrong time and taking a nice tumble. 

For what it’s worth, I’m not overweight. This is the first time of my life where I’m not underweight and have a normal BMI. I’m 5”7 and weight about 130 lbs. I’ve been trying to work out and gain some strength in my joints because I have issues in general with my joints but my knees are especially problematic. I’m coming to you guys because I was taking to my brother, who is very into health and fitness and the human body, and when I was explaining this issue that I wanted to fix he got very stern and concerned and told me I need to do something about my knees because this could be arthritis. So, thanks to him I’m seeing if it’s worth seeking out some medical attention or if I should just start wearing knee braces again for support. I’m just wondering if it’s worth going to see a doctor at this time.

* Diagnosis: Depression, Asperger's and GAD
* No medications. Planning on AD. 

Today I rode my bike for the first time since around one year and after about 40 minutes (of what seemed quite strenous) I got off my bike because I was exhausted. I quickly realized that I was extremely dizzy and nauseous so I decided to sit down but it didn't help. My muscles kept wanting to ""stretch"", or punch something. I felt like vomiting. I could barely keep myself up, physically. 

So I decided to stand up and walk to another spot, where I could lie down. On my way there, everything in my vision became extremely bright. Most notable yellow and white colors, just melted my eyes. Noises became quite muffled, hard to comprehend. I sat down again but it didn't help so I laid down and after a minute or two, all of the problems disappeared. 

----------------

This has happened to me several times in my life. It usually only ever happens when I'm exerting a lot of effort while exercising, when showeing with hot water or after the sauna. 

----------------

A couple of years ago my blood pressure was fine from my understanding. I also, **I think**, had a heart test (plugged stuff to my chest) but they didn't see anything wrong. I was there for unrelated reasons. 

----------------

Right now, hours after the incident, I feel a funny feeling in my chest and I'm slightly dizzy still. Never happened to me to this extent. I can barely formulate my thoughts.

I hope this is not too trivial, but I really struggle to find smth. on google: 2 days ago I got a suspicious mole removed on my back, the wound got sewed with 4 stitches.

The doc put a pressure bandage on the wound and told me to remove it in two days, desinfect it and and to put a big plaster on it. My girlfriend removed the pressure bandage, the wound looks good so far, it's not swollen nor red nor moist. So she put on the plasters, that's when we recognized it's ""Ratioline AQUA Pflaster, steril"" (Probably a German product, as I'm in germany).

However, it says it's waterproof but skinfriendly and it has a wound pad.

Now my question: Are these plasters only made for showering and need to be removed afterwards or am I allowed to keep them on for a day or two?

That happened at least twice a day until Thursday when it just went away randomly. 



Last night I got what felt like a sinus headache. It kept getting worse so I got up to get an ice pack and I felt like I was going to both pass out and vomit. I took some Tylenol and turned off all the lights and it went away after a while. 




I have a problem where my body tries to murder me if I drink too much caffeine- I get dehydrated, bad pulsating headache, and hot/cold flashes but all of those last a day or so then I’m fine. I drank a large Starbucks coffee yesterday so my symptoms from last night could have been just a really bad reaction. 




This morning my mom woke me up and I just felt bad. Kind of like a hangover but not too bad. My temperature was fine but I was kinda hot (it’s Florida so it happens lol). 




The symptoms can kind of be explained but it’s still kind of weird that I’ve had all of these over the past week. So I’m not sure what to do.

Had abdominal pain, went to the hospital and was diagnosed with an ovarian cyst. I have chronic anemia but started taking iron supplements after my stomach issues appeared. I am on a birth control pill which I started taking after my stomach issues as well. 

I am desperate for answers, I’m coming up on a year of this illness and I’m seeing serious repercussions in my health. 

My hair is falling out, not in clumps but more than you would averagely see. I have not been able to brush my teeth regularly (more like once a day every other day) because my nausea is so bad, my teeth are chipping and cracking. I’ve had to miss work before(and even threw up there once), due to my early morning shifts.

gu2a8z,"The mysterious 2.5 year bloat (23 M) 179, 80kg","Whoever can help me out with this is a saint and i thank you for reading

Around 2 and a half years ago during an ab exercise i got injured, it felt like something falling from my upper abdomen to my lower abdomen and it got bloated ever since. I'm not saying something did fall, it just felt like that. This does not feel like a regular bloated stomach or at least what i have been told/read. Symptoms are

\- Lower stomach expands every time i engage it in any activity, be it exercise, digging, lifting, running or anything like that. It seemingly doesn't stop expanding until i stop engaging it. I usually stop when it starts feeling like it will burst out. Even during intercourse i feel it engaging and getting bigger

\- I feel it through the day and when i lay down to sleep as if it is a balloon filled with water, i can only compare it to how you feel after eating a lot of soup and then doing physical activity

\- I don't have a bulge typical of a hernia or anything (confirmed by doctors)

\- My lower abdomen is incredibly weak now. Trying to pick something up from the ground is taxing on my core (or carrying). Even when my stomach isn't as bloated, i feel my lower abdomen weak

\-  I have woken up in the middle of the night feeling my stomach tense

\- When this happened, i was eating a lot of food, drinking safe dozes of protein and i was a bit heavier than i usually was, which probably contributed

\- I have lower back pain since 14, shoulder pain since around 16 and wrist pain since 20 (idk if this helps)

I went to see all the doctors about this, first i was given muscle injury medication, when that didn't work i went to a gastrointerologist (may be spelled wrong) who mentioned i might have a umbilical hernia and sent me to a surgeon, who said i had no such thing, not even an ab injury and explained to me why, she told me i was healthy and to lose weight. That didn't help and months later i was back with the doctors who gave me medication for gasses, didn't work out. They sent me to a chiropractor who gave me liver medication, which also didn't help. I'm from bulgaria where you are mostly given random medication until something works

I drink once or twice a week, don't do any drugs, used to smoke week and cigarrettes but i quit before the injury happened

I would appreciate any help, thank you",2,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gu2a8z/the_mysterious_25_year_bloat_23_m_179_80kg/"")",2020-05-31 09:42:19,Physician Responded

I have always had moles but in the last few years I seem to be developing more and more. Moles that were previously small are growing, previously flat are now more prominent etc. About five years ago I visited my GP and asked about my moles, she brushed it off and said everything looked fine. I'm wondering if I should get a second opinion when Covid has blown over. I don't notice any of them specifically itching, but I do get itchy arms and sometimes that itching includes the moles. I am now very careful in the sun but I had about three really bad sunburns in my early teens. Every mole seems to look different - the ones on my face are more red/skin colour, some are brown and solid, some are brown and patchy, some have hair growing out, some don't. Picture 4 used to be just one mole but another one grew next to it/split off from the original, picture 5 is really small but is spreading. My GP saw all these and said I had nothing to worry about but I'm not sure I believe her. Am I being paranoid?

gu2dtm,Help w/ Bowel (?) Issue,"16 - Hispanic, Male - 5'10"" - 167 lbs



I don't know what I have. I have been online looking at some of my symptoms, and I've come across IBS. I can poop, well. My poop looks well contrasted with the stool chart I found online. It's sausage like with visible cracks. No mucus or blood. One of the most common symptoms of IBS, or, at least I think so, is abdominal cramping. I don't have that. I do, however, switch on and off between diarrhea and normal stools. Perhaps though it's because whenever I do have diarrhea, I've eaten very badly before that. 

My life is not exactly negatively affected by this. It's recurring, it goes and comes back. I will try dietary changes and see if that works. Admittedly, my diet recently has been very different than what I have eaten before. 

It doesn't cause gas either. Not excessively as it's been described. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but I'd like to at least get some reassurance this is nothing serious. I will try even more dietary changes and see if that works out. When it gets bad, I'll try laxatives. I should also mention that I do have bowel movements. Even twice a day. 

I have been so nervous and worried about myself these past few days I've barely had time to reflect on what I feel and how I feel. I also read somewhere else that IBS causes anxiety with some patients. I really hope that doesn't happen to me. Please.

**Age**: 25  
**Sex**: M  
**Height**: 180 cm  
**Weight**: 70 kg - 100 kg (condition has lasted through both weight loss and weight gain)  
**Race**: Caucasian  
**Complaint**: Scaly, itchy, peeling skin on the scalp and coming down the face, flakes in the hair

**Medical Issues**: None that I know of

**Smoke**: No

It started from the top of the scalp and moved to the forehead, this is just where it's most visible for a picture. When too much of it gathers up, it gets itchy and makes everything it touches oily. It's not too difficult to remove with my nail but it can bleed and hurt. And my fingers are left oily after that, so every time I do it, I need to wash my hands.

The best way to remove it is to simply... wash my hair. The water softens it up and rubbing in the shampoo with my fingers is enough to scrape it all off and get it to fall down. But not all of it comes out... I usually still have left over even after a shower where I've washed my hair 3+ times. It's not much and it's a lot more manageable than what you see in the picture. The picture is the result of \~16 hours of not washing my hair (I woke up early in the day and took this right before showering for the night).

This thing is all over my scalp, under the hair. It's plagued me for years and I've been to multiple doctors who prescribe shampoos that never work. Over the years, it's started to come down from the top of the scalp to my forehead, the sideburns, the back of my earlobes, inside of my earlobes a bit and even my eyebrows very recently.

How the hell do I solve this? I've tried all sorts of shampoos, I've tried showering more, I've tried showering less. I've tried washing my hair just with water or on different schedules (e.g. every day vs every few days). Nothing works, at least not permanently. Having a shower just reduces it temporarily by scraping it off, but then it just builds up again.

Well just when I thought things were getting better, Friday night/morning I woke up scratching the area. It was itchy. Throughout the day the redness and slight puffiness increased. I noticed more cracks in the sides of my mouth. Yesterday (Saturday) I bought Lotrimin and cortizone 10 to apply, I have used both twice so far. Also have been using tea tree oil and Vaseline at the corners to prevent saliva from getting into the cracks. But today I woke up and it doesn’t look any better, maybe even worse😖 how do I cure this?

One day we were sitting at a chipotle restaurant September 2018 i. Buffalo, NY and all of a sudden my fiancé looked like she seen a ghost and proceeded to call 911. From that day on she has had non stop panic attacks that leave her rocking in bed every night. Some days are better then others and doctors just keep switching anxiety meds but the problem still exists. Clearly the meds are just barley keeping her functional. She did have a car accident but that was almost exactly one year prior to this happening. She’s been in and out of the hospital non stop sometimes 4 times a week since then. Constant adrenaline surges that just leave her weak and sleeping constantly. It’s heart breaking and I don’t know what to do anymore. She wants to work and have a life again. A doctor did say she has pots ( ortho static hypotension) and she is on meds to bring her pressures up but her blood pressure is still super low constantly. One doctor thinks she has lupus but does not have any warning signs just a very funky c3/c4 numbers. She currently is on Prozac and trying to make it through everyday. From the very beginning they put her on a small dose of klonapin to help her deal with this and she is still currently on it. Hospitals say she’s not dieing and give her the boot soon as they give her a once over. Her doctors are only allowed to dig so much without proof apparently. The chipoltle we were at when this happened was the more calm experience ever. Building was empty and nothing going on. I don’t have a explanation of what happened and need help please. What can flick a switch in someone out of no where and bring all this on? Before this happened she was riding motorcycles, snowboarding everything a normal person would do and now she’s bed ridden and barley has the courage to leave the house.

gu7jhq,(18m) dealing with ED," 

This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons, but I am genuinely confused. I'm an 18 yr old male (6'3, 155 lbs) with no underlying medical conditions. I don't do drugs, including prescription for anything, and I'd consider my lifestyle healthy. I lift four to five times a week (no cardio aside from short rests in between sets), my diet isn't bad (mostly chicken, veggies, and burritos from my work), and I rarely get under 7 hours of sleep.

My sex drive has slowly gotten more dormant for the last two years since I started taking work and school more seriously. While currently my work has been stressing me out every night (not to sound like a puss, but its labor intensive, boring, and I have little motivation to go), its not like I'm losing sleep over it.

Earlier this week a girl I've been talking to wanted to have sex, so I said why not. It was late at night and I was quite tired, and I couldn't stay hard. We ended up stopping, and she felt as if I wasn't attracted to her. This is frustrating not only because I've disciplined myself towards a healthy lifestyle, but I'm also only 18. I'm going to stop jerking off and looking at porn, but I think the worst case scenario is I have heart problems.

I also think it could be because of performance anxiety, because I am hard while we make out.

On Friday, he returned to urgent care once he got the negative results. They did a rapid COVID test on him and it was negative again. So, he went and had a chest x ray. 

Urgent care said they would call with the results, but they haven’t. They gave him a Z-pack, prednisone, and an inhaler. As of today (Sunday) he does not have a fever. He still has cough and shortness of breath. We just saw the X-ray report and the results said, “Blurring of bronchovascular markings and right superior hilar prominence.

 I’ve had what I assume is a UTI for about 3 weeks. I’ve had a UTI before that was much worse but went away on its own, and this time around my only symptoms is burning/discomfort in the urethra when peeing, and maybe some slight discomfort in my bladder for a few minutes after. There was one day 2 weeks ago where my urine was tinged with blood, that hasn’t happened since. My urine has been cloudy I think, but that’s also stopped happening. I’ve been to the doctors twice for this, but I can’t afford to keep going to the ER as I don’t have a primary doctor. I don’t think they’ve cultured my urine at all to see what it’s susceptible to. 

 It hasn’t gotten worse but it also hasn’t gotten better. The burning is still there, and is noticeably worse at night.

gu9q29,18M Anal Syphilis or Anal Warts,"Hey everyone! I just wanted to share my story to see if anyone else is in a similar situation. I’m a 18M and I was sexually active. Mid-April 2020 I got an anal fissure from unprotected anal sex and got medication from my doctor (First hydrocortisone which didn’t help much, then 1 week of antibiotics and then .2% nitroglycerin which actually helped). My skin started appearing abnormal when I stopped using the antibiotics and started using the nitroglycerin. I had an appointment with a general surgeon to observe my anal area and she told me it was “condyloma (Anal warts)” so she put me on 5% imiquimod 3 times a week and advised me to stop taking the nitroglycerin. 

I just went to urgent care this morning because I woke up with a bleeding tonsil with a sore throat I’ve been having for 2 weeks now and an earache in my right ear that started 1 week ago. They told me the results of my blood test for  STDs/HIV and I tested positive for syphilis, but negative for everything else. They couldn’t do a throat culture because of the pandemic, but now I’m on antibiotics for both tonsillitis (in case I have it) and got a penicillin shot for syphilis. I just did some research on syphilis and the “anal warts” look a lot like syphilis when I compare pictures of it online to my own condition. I messaged my doctor about this, but does anyone know any next steps I should take? Like should I stop using the imiquimod cream to treat my “anal warts”, etc. ?

So to start off to give some of my background information. I do have gastritis, IBS, along with a long list of other issues involving my stomach and intestines. So I’ve always had really weird poops and issues that involve me pooping. Once I need to poop I typically only have a matter of minutes before I need to get to the toilet sometimes even less than a minute, partly due to my low muscle tone, making it hard for me to hold it. I typically also get sharp pains in my lower stomach area and sides right before I need to go poop. Also my poops and farts typically smell really bad.

But lately Around the time when the cramping and pain sets in before I need to go to the bathroom, I can typically smell the really bad smell my poop,  But the weird thing is I haven’t farted yet. So is it weird that I can smell my poop before I poop and without farting. The poop has also been very very dark , still brown not black. It also feels kind of acidy on the way outI also have been hospitalized a few times because of internal bleeding in my intestines, but like said my poop is dark brown not black or red so I don’t think it’s that.

guadcd,[19F] Can't afford dentist/medical bills but have had a dental abscess since October,"19, F, 5'2, 115lbs

Long story short.. 

In October: Felt very very intense pain in a tooth. Like nothing I've ever felt before. Seriously, I thought I was going to throw up from it. I went to the dentist and it turned out to be a tooth infection. I was prescribed antibiotics and Vicodin and told to go somewhere to get a root canal but my mother (she's a narcissist which is important to keep in mind) refused because she didn't want to pay for it. Pain went away, so I stopped asking her. 

In February: Tooth pain came back. Same pain, same tooth. My face also swelled up an insane amount in the span of just a few hours. My lip was about four times it's usual size and the swelling went into my cheek, jaw, nose, and even around my eye. Despite my mom's hesitancy, I was taken to the ER and received a panogram and the infection was back. Again I was prescribed Vicodin and antibiotics. Sent to my GP and he told me to go to get a root canal, obviously. But again my mother refused. 

Now: I have a pus filled pimple on my gum above this tooth. A little bit of pain but nothing serious yet. My mom is actually kicking me out of the house and I only have $3000 in savings and no car. No job yet because I'm a full time student. I'm under her insurance though. 

I don't know what to do because I'm obviously going to get a job very soon but I still won't be able to afford bills to take care of this tooth. 

So basically... is this a serious issue? Is there something I could do at home to take care of it? Will I die eventually or could it clear up on its own? I'm going to try to stick it out unless it's fatal. And even then, maybe I'll just deal with the consequences at this point.

guaob9,Scratched by a squirrel I accidentally scared - do I need to go to a Dr?,"Hey everyone,

I am a 31M (5'7"" and roughly 200lbs, White, living near Seattle, WA, taking lisinopril, picture is below) and I was taking some trash out and when I got back to my apartment, my girlfriend gave me a small bag of small potatoes to throw out we forgot about. I put it in a small bag (because I couldn't remember how long we had them, and I was worried about maggots) and then went to the dumpster to toss them - only I overthrew and the bag landed off in the corner of the dumpster. It was reachable by walking, but I wanted to go put my shoes on for wet terrain since the dumpster was sitting in a pool of dirty water and I didn't want that on my sandals. After changing my shoes, I went back out and was going to pick them up. I had to move a big cardboard box that was in the dumpster to get by it, and as soon as I touched it, a squirrel whom I know I scared flung out of the dumpster from his trash diving and landed on my arm, scratching me as he tried to bolt off to safety.

It did not act weird and try to aggressively attack me, just get the hell out of there. However, in the pic I've included, you can see I've been ""scratched"" where its claws have slightly pierced my skin. I can call my doctor tomorrow and try to go in same day, if needed, but was wondering if it would be necessary so I can attempt to avoid that if possible, all things going on with covid considered.

Image: https://imgur.com/wB2Cln5

After it happened, I gave up on the potatoes and immediately went inside, proceeded to wash my hands with antibacterial soap and then drowned my hand in hydrogen peroxide, followed by another round of soap, followed by hand sanitizer with 75% alochol, followed by another round of (thorough) antibacterial soap handwashing.

I am pretty sure I wasn't bitten, as it didn't latch onto me and I didn't really bleed at all. No blood ran down my hand, left the wounds, etc, none of that happened. But, I was in shock initially because it flew at me so damn fast and it startled me like crazy.

If anyone has any advice or anything for home treatment, I would definitely appreciate it! Otherwise, is this something I should seek out going to the doctor on right away?

Weight: 150 lbs

Smoker: No

Current Medications: None


Photo: https://i.imgur.com/X6EWtQU.jpg


For almost 2 years now, I’ve had issues with eye infections. I don’t understand it. I’ve been given antibiotics several times now. 

I was given Bio True daily contacts from my eye doctor last year. (Prior to this, I had been using the monthly ones.) Because of my problems with redness and infections, I almost never wear them — as in, I go months without wearing contacts, then I wear them once, have eye issues the following day, and stop wearing contacts again for another couples of months. 
 
Yesterday, I decided to try wearing my contacts after going a couple months without wearing them. They were brand new, never opened daily contacts. I even decided to take them out and throw them away in the middle of the day and put in another pair of brand new dailies, just to give my eyes the best chance of relief. Regardless, the following day (today) I woke up to bright red eyes that are somewhat painful, similar to a sore muscle feeling in them. 

Can anyone guess as to why this keeps happening? Am I just doomed to suddenly never wear contacts again? I don’t understand how brand new contacts can be causing this repeated issue in both my eyes. I’ve worn contact lenses since I was a teenager and never had issues before. I never sleep in them, never shower in them. I’ve always been a responsible contact lens wearer.

EDIT: Just wanted to add that the photo doesn’t even do the redness justice. I also took it later in the morning, rather than when I first woke up and it was at its worst.",2,9,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gum0ye/33f_eyes_always_turn_red_painful_any_time_i_wear/"")",2020-06-01 07:53:53,Physician Responded
gum1yj,question about vision and eye prescriptions," Hello. I hope it's ok to post this here. I can't find a vision subreddit.

I got a new contact lens prescription, but even so things are always a bit blurry. Is that normal? Would it be better with a different brand? Or would this be better if I wear glasses instead of contacts? 

My new glasses prescription is -9 and -9.25 while my new contacts prescription is -7 and -8. Why would there be a larger difference between eyes for the contacts than for the glasses? I just wanted to make sure that there's not an error before buying glasses. 

Also, I’ve heard that you should get name brand contact lens solution and not generic, and I’ve also heard that you shouldn’t get your contacts from an online discount seller but should get them through the optometrist’s office. Is there truth to this? I generally like saving money when I can.

She gets nauseous after eating small amounts of anything really, thus resulting in her not wanting to eat much. She isn't losing weight though.

gv7znf,Feel like I was going to faint after hitting elbow,"19f on propranolol, healthy weight, not drank or smoked recently.

This morning getting ready for work I hit my elbow on my wardrobe handle which caused a lot of pain and caused me to feel like I was going to faint the pain continued for about 5 minutes and I sat down which stopped the sensation of me fainting. My hand also went numb for a good 10 minutes and then subsided to pins and needles, which went away about 20 minutes later. I had taken 2 10mg tablets of propranolol for anxiety about 10 minutes before (unsure if that could have caused the fainting feelings?) I don't have any marks on my elbow as I don't bruise easily anyway and it is still painful to move but I expect that. Is the fainting after hitting your elbow normal?

gv8i1n,[M/29] How do I get a qualified professional (radiologist) to walk me through my CT images?,"I'm a 29 M, 6'1""/185cm 170lbs/77Kg male having lower right abdominal pain and fever starting 7-weeks post-appendectomy (now at 10 weeks, pain continues but without fever).

I've had 3 CT scans now, all from the ER.
1 pre-appendectomy
2 post appendectomy

The first obviously showed acute appendicitis.  The second showed a phlegmon, but no abscess or fluid collection.  The third showed ""nothing"" (therefore I wasn't admitted).

How do I get a qualified medical professional to sit down with me and actually explain what they see?  The radiology department at the hospital has explicitly stated they don't do this, and the patient advocate department confirmed this is standard operating procedure.

For the curious, here's the full timeline:

March 24: First outpatient CT scan, go to ER and admitted to hospital.

March 26: Appendectomy / Released same day.

May 12: 2nd CT scan from ER and Re-admitted for phlegmon,

May 14: Released after 2-days IV antibiotics.  Prescribed 10 days oral antibiotics (amoxicillin).

May 22: Abdominal Pain Returns

May 23: Go to ER after severe nausea, but no vomiting.  No fever.  Labs all show negative.  Discharged.

May 24: Finish Amoxicillin.

May 28: Back to ER after severe nausea, but no vomiting.  No fever.  3rd CT scan shows nothing. Labs all show negative. Discharged again.
June 1: Spoke with GI specialist.  She didn't want to make any diagnosis.  Said she's not qualified to look at CT images.

Today: pain is still present, varying in intensity.  Some amount of nausea (taking nausea meds now though).


I've spoken with my PCP (One medical) intermittently.  They've recommended (like everyone else) monitoring the situation and going to the ER if I develop a fever.

I acknowledge that I may be a slight hypochondriac (hence the nausea, perhaps?) but I can't ignore the lower abdominal pain.  It keeps me up at night even with pain meds.

So: How do I get someone to review my images with me in person?  A simple request which I'm learning isn't as easy at it seems.

gv8p26,"Hi Docs of Reddit, I need you're help identifying an appropriate doc and maybe some feedback.","Some background: I am a 24F. This has started about a year ago now. I'm currently trying to find a diagnosis for my health issues, but also stuck on which type of doc to see about another issue. 

I have been seeing a Neurologist. I currently have peripheral neuropathy (confirmed by a nerve conduction test and I do not have diabetes, I was tested for that too), but my neuropathy is abnormal. I have not had any injuries nor chemotherapy to explain why I have it. It has not progressed normally. It started on the top of my right food and slowly spread and instead of going to my left foot as expected, it showed up in my right hand. I have had an MRI done for both my brain and my spine, all have came back normal except disc degeneration and a herniation (but it has been proved that it does not relate to my neuropathy). I've also had blood tests to rule out heavy metal. The neuropathy does cause weakness and pain on the right side of my body. 

The neurologist is stumped. He believes I have erythomelalgia (aka Man of Fire Disease) as well, but I must go to a rheumatologist to get an official diagnosis (I'm currently working on that). The neurologist also suggested I see an eye doc. I have started needing reading glasses to read smaller words, at 24 that is concerning. I did my routine yearly eye doc visit for my contacts before the issues started to come up in my eyes. I had discussed the neuropathy and he checked the optic nerves but they were healthy. The neurologist did not specify if I should see a optometrist or ophthalmologist though, and I'm unsure if one would be better to go to that would be able to work with me with my current issues. 

So in total my questions are:

1. Do any of you have any ideas for my neuropathy and why it's happening?
2. Who is better to see for my issues,  optometrist or ophthalmologist?

gv9q1x,30/F Passed out for 10 minutes with convulsions this morning. Paramedics found nothing. The hospital near me is one of the worse covid-affected in my city. I'm evaluating how badly I need to go.,"30/F / 130 lbs / 5''5, I don't drink, don't smoke, no drugs, not on the pill. My diet is balanced and Iexercice a fair amount. I live in Montreal.

History : two weeks ago, an old jaw injury came back. Because of the lockdown and because usually it's just a sore muscle that needs to rest, I didn't go to the dentist right away. After a week, the inflammation got really bad and the dentist gave me a prescription of muscle/back pain relief. 3 a days, then 2 a day then less if I feels things are ok.  My dentist told me it could last from 10 to 14 days.   


Those pills were really hardcore on my digestion. It would get me gassy, I would have cramps that woke me up during the night. Mild inconvenient, but otherwise my jaw is doing fine.   


It's been almost two weeks, I've stop the medication a few days ago because I was worried for the state of my intestine in the long run. I stopped having cramps.  


Yesterday, we made homemade pizza, with a specialty type flour (00, which is supposed to contain more gluten , because we wanted to step up our pizza skills). I also tried a new local cold-pressed apple juice and we bought Di Bufalla to go on the pizza. In the sauce, we added herbs grown in our yard. Earlier this week, I also baked brownies with marroon cream, which is something I have never done before.    


Woke up around 5 AM with cramps but also with nausea. It's not unheard of for me to feel like this if I ate something my body wants to reject.  I go for #2, the nausea does not go away. I check my phone : 5:05 AM. I hope I'll be able to go back to sleep. Maybe I'm gonna throw up ?  


When I'm nauseus, I like to lay on the hard cold bathroom floor. The last thing I remember is to reach for the floor.   


After that, I feel my significant other pace around me, checking for my pulse and telling someone on the phone I'm not responsive. I reply : I'm responsive ??? And I realize I may have fallen asleep on the floor.   


The thing is, my boyfriend heard me hit the base of the shower (probably with my head, but my head does not hurt at all). I was convulsing and one of my leg was hitting something, making a lot of noise. All that alerted my boyfriend and he came looking for me. My boyfriend tried to ''wake me up'' by talking to me, pinching me, a little tap on the cheek. I was unresponsive and shaking. The paramedics were on their way. I took my phone : 5:23 AM.  


Paramedics talked to me, I was all there, but sleepy. They took my pressure and electrocardiogram laying on the bed, sitting and up. All good. Took my blood sugar level. All good. I had not soiled myself while passing out.  They asked me if I wanted to come with them at the hospital, I told them I was hesitant due to the state of our particular hospital. They told me to rest and consider going to another hospital. 

For three hours after they left me, I had passing cramps (resting in bed, feeling a pain building up, going for #2 for what could go out, repeat). Eventually my nausea was due to being hungry. I drank a glass of milk and now I feel fine ( normal but tired).  


I just don't remember ANYTHING between 5:05 and 5:23 and that freaks me out. 

What the fuck was that ? We have no history of anything like that in my family. I never passed out in my life and never had any head injury. I have a deadly allergy to brazilian nuts only. My mother is lactose intolerant. I am not.

gvdm44,Pregnancy in trans males and radiation exposure,"Age: 31

Sex: female to male transgender (he/him/his)

Weight: many lbs

Height: Hobbit size

Medicines: testosterone, irrelevant

Conditions: autism spectrum disorder, needed an x-ray, having ovaries and a uterus, not being sexually active

I was on r/xxchromosomes last night and read a post about someone complaining about an invasively thorough questioning they'd gotten about whether they could possibly be pregnant before some sort of test/imaging that could have harmed the fetus. I completely understand why that would happen. Patients can be deceptive, ashamed, or just not aware of the risks in this case. So, I get why they'd ask and ask again. In the past, I haven't questioned it when doctors or nurses have done that with me because technically I could still conceive (because sometimes you can ovulate even while you're on testosterone  and some of us are bi or gay (MSM)). 

However, some of the people didn't mention being told they have to get a pregnancy test. I began to wonder if that was typical and if it isn't common practice to make a patient get a pregnancy test before an x-ray. But maybe it's something that varies from location to location. 

To be frank, I don't have a victim complex and I'm not being paranoid and I'm not being overly sensitive here. I have a history of being treated like garbage in medical settings, what I would guess is malpractice and is definitely illegal (HIPAA violations, sexual assault, rape, refusal to treat) and it occurred to me that this could be something of a transphobic microaggression, a sort of way of rubbing it in that I have uterus. I mean that sounds ridiculous and petty, but I've literally had nurses talk to me about my (non-existent) ""bra and panties,"" the penis falling off the model while practicing caths, and insist on calling me a woman within earshot, as a way to make me feel uncomfortable about my anatomy/being tramsgender. I've had a couple doctors uncover my body just to check out my primary sex traits when it wasn't even related the reason I was there. So, I'm not being paranoid or anything here, just cautious, I guess. 

I have ""high functioning"" autism (Asperger's) and I can't always tell if people are messing with me... I tend to be quite literal and expect the best in people. I am sometimes a little naive, until after the fact, when I realized ""hey, I didn't have to undress in front of them. They should have give me a gown,"" or ""holy shit, he had an erection during my exam."" I just wonder if maybe this could have been one of these situations where things aren't on the up and up. 

If it were, I would like to be able to refuse the pregnancy test to stand up for myself in the future. I always request a radiation proof lead vest or cover during x-rays, because if I ever settle down, I do want to detransition temporarily and try to conceive. It does cause some level of distress to be reminded of my sexual anatomy, so if I could just avoid the pregnancy test that would be good for my mental health and make going to the doctor easier. I think the only way that the medical system will change to be more respectful of transgender people is if transgender people are empowered with knowledge and can advocate for themselves. I fully expect microaggressions and abusive behavior to continue until our culture changes. I don't want to make any fuss about something that isn't an issue though. That's why I want to know if it's standard protocol to make someone take a pregnancy test before an x-ray. Thank you for reading this and I appreciate your input. I hope you are doing your best to keep safe with the virus at work, especially with the second wave coming.",2,23,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gvdm44/pregnancy_in_trans_males_and_radiation_exposure/"")",2020-06-02 12:11:09,Physician Responded

Pretty much constant low level pain in that hip even when laying in bed still.

My Ortho scheduled me an MRI with and without contrast, but at the MRI, the technician injected the contrast into a vein in my arm. When I got back to the ortho, he seemed upset that they didn't inject the contrast directly into my hip. However, the radiologist could not find any labrum tear in the MRI images.

Is this because the contrast was used incorrectly? Something is definitely wrong in my hip, but the ortho moved on to NSAIDs, rest and PT and scrapped the idea of surgery  after not seeing any tear in the MRI.

gvvj4j,Is my sister dangerous?,"I've never posted on Reddit before and I'm not even sure that this is the right platform to raise a question like this, but I'm going to give it a go because I'm in need of an answer. 

My sister Erin has attempted suicide at least half a dozen times and has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. My family and I have recently become deeply concerned by some dark signs in her behaviour that indicate to us she could be contemplating doing something to cause serious harm to one of us. Here's a collection of things we've noticed:

* A penchant for stories about **female** murderers (she recently watched a series of documentaries on the subject)
* A book in her room about a **female** murderer (This book was properly, properly gruesome)
* A large kitchen knife concealed in her bedroom drawer
* A tendency to engage in aggressive physical contact with her **female** siblings - the other party unwilling
* A cold, dark stare when she does not get her way (when this happens, she will sort of 'shut down' and go to her bedroom). 
* She appears to lack any compassion or understanding of other's feelings
* She does not appear to experience any true, stable, lasting happiness or positive emotion (she laughs manically and often, but it's a weird sort of amusement that I can't quite explain)
* She will readily, knowingly and repeatedly lie with and without premeditation
* My youngest sibling has stated **she** does not feel safe being alone in a room with her
* When she turned 18 two months ago she instructed her psychologist not to provide any information on her condition or feedback from her sessions with the doctor to her parents
* There are a lot of us (two boys, three girls, Mom &amp; Dad) and we're normally a happy family, but her presence often (though not always) is like a dark cloud on the rest of us 
* Our feelings toward her are such that we are all soon to install locks on our bedroom doors

Many of these things may not seem particularly terrible in and of themselves, but consider this as an aggregate and you may understand that we are very, very concerned - even scared. I'm particularly worried because something else has happened recently that I know will cause her 'evil side' to flair up. She may attempt suicide again, but I really don't want her to hurt or kill someone else. She hurts us all enough psychologically. 

Mom &amp; Dad don't want to ask her to leave the house permanently because we love her of course, she's our flesh and blood. Family. But alas, therein lies the rub. We don't know where to turn.

*My question is, do you think our feelings are justified? Commensurate with her behaviour? Or are we over-thinking all this? I'm not necessarily looking for a specific answer per se, but any well-informed and/or professional thought will be very much appreciated.*

gvvyr5,Two instances of brief chest pain. Emergency?,"Male, Caucasian, 28, 225 lbs, non-smoker

Blood pressure typically hovers around 120/80

About a week ago I had a sort of diffuse burning pain that could be felt in my chest and in my throat. It lasted about 3 minutes and went away on it's own. Last night I woke up from my sleep feeling it again, and it seemed to go away just as fast, but I wasn't completely lucid and I was able to just turn over on my side and fall back asleep again.

I've been reluctant to schedule an appointment with my doctor because of COVID-19.  


Here are some relevant details:  
\-I had a stress-test performed about half a year ago and the cardiologist said everything seemed fine.

\-I have a history of obesity, my peak weight being 330 pounds.

\-I had an endoscopy about a year and a half ago and I was diagnosed with GERD, I haven't had too much trouble with symptoms since I lost weight.

\-Over quarantine I've been drinking between 5 and 10 drinks a week, usually all consumed on one or two days. This has been for about 2-3 months.

\-I stopped doing my cardio about a year ago.

\-I've had increased anxiety and stress.

It seems like acid reflux is most likely, do I need to make an appointment with my doctor or is it safe for me to just watch this?",1,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gvvyr5/two_instances_of_brief_chest_pain_emergency/"")",2020-06-03 08:25:20,Physician Responded

gvwwid,[30M] Red Circles on Inner Thigh,"Just wanted some clarity on what this might be. I developed what I can best describe as small pink, somewhat flaky, circular dots on my inner thighs. They are symmetrically present on both thighs - particularly in the creases where my thighs meet my crotch. They are vaguely itchy, but very easy to ignore. There is no other discomfort. Imgur link below. 

I lead a fairly healthy and hygienic lifestyle. I am sexually active with a trusted and healthy individual. I do wear tight jeans and boxer briefs almost every day. This past weekend my groin was particularly sweaty after going for a long walk in the humid sunshine - it was quite hot in the area where I live. I returned to an un-air-conditioned apartment and the sweating persisted. It probably didn't help that I watched a movie on a warm laptop (the laptop rested on my lap). I did shower later that evening and used a bar of soap pretty comprehensively. The dots appeared seemingly overnight. 

Is this **jock itch** or some other form of heat rash? Is it possible that the soap I use is causing irritation? 

Any insight on what it might be or what a possible treatment would be is very much appreciated.

gvx5p0,I think I was circumcised wrong,"20M, 5'2"", 55kg, Filipino, circumcision, no medical issues or intakes whatsoever.

So for context, in the Philippines, children usually get circumcised around age 10 (I feel like this is significant information as through my searching I've only found results related to infant circumcision). I always thought that my penis looked weird as it looked really different from stuff I saw from books/media/porn. Recently, I wondered about it again and did a little more digging and couldn't really find anything about my case so I came here. Basically, my penis looks like it was a half-done circumcision. The front (facing me) has the foreskin removed, but the back part is intact in such a way that I can literally let it touch the tip of the head. It also has a weird angle to how the part with the removed foreskin is not directly facing me, but a little to the left. I have never consulted a doctor about this so it's quite possible that I mistook it for normal all this time. Should I be worried?

It’s somewhat tender to touch, a little less than an inch in diameter. He went to the hospital again. X-ray looked fine, they didn’t mention seeing anything unusual on the blood count or urinalysis.

Medications: atenolol 50 mg, Kyleena (low-dose levonorgestrel) IUD

Medical conditions: hypertension, high grade cervical dysplasia, ovarian cyst  

**Question:** I've had various ob/gyn related concerns in the past (related to bleeding before having the IUD, told it was due to the cervical dysplasia) and now bleeding presumably due to the new IUD. Both of these scenarios led to me having a transvaginal ultrasound. The first one was a few years ago, the second a few weeks ago. My question is about ovary size, on both scans it appears that my ovaries (particularly the left) are very small. 

First scan left ovary: 1.7 x 1.6 x 1.3 cm, second scan: 2.0 x 1.9 x 1.5 cm. 

My right ovary is slightly bigger on my recent scan due to the presence of a simple ovarian cyst (cyst is slightly wider than 3 cm), but on the last scan was 2.3 x 1.5 x 1.4 cm. 

No physician has ever made any comment on the size of the ovaries, but from what I have learned in classes (health sciences student), this is smaller than normal. Is there any cause for concern related to fertility or any other reason why the ovaries would be this small? 

Another thing to note that may be important is that I took combination birth control pills for 9 years prior to getting the IUD.

Smoke 1/2 pack a day
Bladder polyps
Urinary discomfort/OAB since 17 years of age, though got worse over last few years

Just had a transurethral resection today to remove 2 polyps from my bladder. The urologist shows up 20 minute late, barely speaks to me, and then splits immediately after the surgery. I thought he was going to debrief, explain how the procedure went, and discuss timeline for getting the biopsy back (not sure if they are cancerous). I had so many flipping questions. The nurse told me when I arrived that he would phone my friend who was picking me up and explain how everything went. He did not do that. He had an assistant call and simply tell my friend he could come retrieve me.

I've had previous issues with this doctor when I got the cystoscopy a few weeks when they found the polyp. He did the procedure, explained briefly what he saw, and did not ask me to talk with him after the procedure once I got my bearings back. I was very disoriented,  confused, and to be honest, scared. Do I have cancer? Is this life threatening? Etc? I then messaged him multiple times on the patient portal and finally got a response 4 evenings later. It was a positive message--you're probably fine, chill out--but still, it was a very, very brief response.

I don't want to come off as some needy patient, but yeah, I've just felt really dismissed and insignificant in all of this. Am I over reacting? Do doctors typically not talk with patients after procedures?

gwkvvo,"NP told my mother her 10/10 squeezing chest pain radiating to her jaw was attributable to her hiatal hernia, or gas. I trust her evaluation but still a bit concerned.","I’m a new grad PA. I know my place. And I know how long the differential is for chest pain. But this still worries me. Here’s a rough take on what my mom described to me.

58 y/o white female presents to the office for evaluation of an episode of chest pain one week ago. She reports she was ironing clothes around 6pm when she experienced a sudden onset of 10/10 substernal chest pain radiating to the back and bilateral neck/jaw. In her own words: “squeezing pressure, like an F150 on my chest; scary; worst pain I’ve ever had.” Denies SOB, diaphoresis, dizziness, neuro sx, N/V/D, abdominal pain, reflux, dysphagia. She took ASA 81mg, aleve 220mg, and klonopin 0.5mg and took a bath. The pain persisted unchanged for 60-90 minutes before suddenly subsiding. She did not seek care (or even call me or my father) because she was afraid of contracting covid in the ED. I know.

She has had two episodes of milder exertional chest discomfort in the past few years and in both instances EKG, labs, and stress tests were unremarkable. Had a hiatal hernia diagnosed via EGD ~10 years ago. Details unknown and unsure of the indication at that time.

PMHx otherwise notable for hyperlipidemia, anxiety, chronic LBP, IBS. No FHx or additional CV risk factors aside from above. Lifelong nonsmoker, one glass of wine nightly. ASCVD is ~5%.

EKG one week after the episode was unremarkable and unchanged from prior in 2019. Labs wnl. VS wnl. BMI 25. 

According to my mom, NP’s diagnosis was pain 2/2 gas, hiatal hernia, or possibly biliary colic. Low concern for cardiac etiology due to unchanged EKG from prior, absence of dyspnea/diaphoresis, low ASCVD, normal past stress tests, and (remote) h/o hiatal hernia. I think her evaluation is certainly reasonable and probably influenced by the fact that my mom is admittedly seen for a lot of BS visits like URI and back pain. 

But I think a repeat stress test is warranted given the drastic change in the character of her symptoms during this episode. Despite her RFs angina would be higher on my differential than gas or HH. Because I know my mother is a wimp and didn’t get to the target metrics of either of her stress tests. And I know she very likely told the NP a different story than I got because she wouldn’t want to face the reality of having a serious medical issue (after I told her she should have gone to the ED she kept trying to reframe the story that it was the edamame she ate earlier, she was once vaguely told she had a HH, and she had steak two days ago which probably caused it because webmd).

28yo male, 6’2” tall, 190lbs medium build, was physically active but not as much for months, no current medications other than the occasional melatonin, do not smoke or drink or do drugs and troubleshooting a diagnosis of mild sleep apnea.

Gathering second opinions from both users and sleep specialists in this forum. Long story short: I was on 50mg Seroquel years ago that seemed to have helped but eventually I think my apnea escalated and even though that medication knocked me out, I still felt exhausted and groggy 24/7. Which then brought me to an in-lab sleep study that conclude a 5.x AHI when sleeping on my side and 7.x on my back. They found “frequent awakenings” but nothing to do with leg movements and unfortunately they didn’t conduct a thorough enough of an investigation to check if it was purely obstructive or central, nor did they mention if there was UARS or other underlying sleep disorders. For this test I was still on the Seroquel.

Fast-forward till now, I discontinued the Seroquel and a few months late did an at-home test which found an AHI of 11 but because this test was not as thorough as the in-lab, as well as the original in-lab test not checking for anything other than obstructive, I’m waiting on a follow-up in-lab test and was hoping to do it without the influence of any medication. Thanks to COVID it’s likely going to take a while. I’ve been consistently using APAP for the past 2.5 months and my symptoms have either been just as bad as before APAP and frequently even worse.

A close friend recommended Mirtazapine as it helped him overcome similar issues. I’ve done quite a bit of research and it doesn’t seem to be as “risky” as seroquel, but considering my underlying issue is likely apnea-related, would this medication help in a low dosage? A walk-in telehealth doctor prescribed a 7.5mg daily dosage with an increase to 15mg if nothing changes after a few days.

This has been something that has bothered me for a few months now and started small, but I have slowly felt it growing. It started with a small area on the front left part of my left thigh. The surface of my thigh is almost completely numb, sort of like when you put numbing cream on an area of skin. I am able to feel pressure if you press down, but as far as pain(pinching scratching) and general feeling goes, it is extremely dulled or nonexistent. 

Over the months it has spread to be a larger section of my thigh and down to the side of my knee. There is almost a clear area of difference between feeling and not feeling on my thigh. 

One of the more worrying things is that I will randomly get feeling in the area, sometimes while lay, sitting, getting up, or walking. This feeling is extreme and the first few times felt as if I had something touching my skin burning it like a hot piece of metal. Sometimes it will be  random bursts of it, while other times it can last a few minutes.

gyv9sc,Should I worry (scalp creases)?,"The thing is I (24M,171cm about 85kg) for financial reasons I shaved my head yesterday and I noticed a few creases on the scalp.

I dont have any neurological issue that  I know of honestly. I would go directly to a dermatologist but, for one, the one at my local public hospital is a bad professional (even if it wasnt I would try to avoid the hospital unless is necesary due to pandemic), and I cannot travel between cities due to quarantine.

Over the past three or four weeks i have noticed that my lower back has been hurting quite a bit. I feel like i have a balloon in my back and I have lost quite a bit of flexibility there as well. Some of the only pain relief that I get is from popping my back and then I hear a really loud pop, but even when I am doing this I still feel like I can't get all of the pressure out. And for the past couple of days it has been getting worse as now my legs have been going numb and tingling. I am very active so I know its not from being on my bum all day and I eat relatively healthy. I have also tried all kinds of streches, poses, and online yoga classes but nothing seems to be working.

gyw7ak,Eye flashes for the first time.,"First of all, an half hour ago I didn't even know eye flashes is a thing. I was just sitting looking at phone and suddenly I saw something glowing like a star, a very small light glowing on left side. I tried looking at it and it also moved just like floaters. I suddenly realised its in my eye. I blinked and it went away. So I searched on internet and found out about eye flashes. Here is a simple description of what I saw. It was white but it felt like was constantly changing colors (twinkling would be the perfect word I guess). The whole thing lasted for 1-2 sec. It went away after blinking. I am sure it was on my left eye. I am a 21 year old male with lazy eye (right eye). I have been trying to fix my lazy eye in  this quarantine with eye exercises and by covering my left eye to force my right lazy eye to look straight. It gives some strain and sometimes tear comes out of my eyes but I don't think it has anything to do with eye flash.",4,8,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gyw7ak/eye_flashes_for_the_first_time/"")",2020-06-08 02:32:16,Physician Responded

Today I was taking care of my neighbor’s dogs when one of the jumped up to take a treat out if my hand. As she dropped back down her nail went right down my thigh and it hurt a lot. It didn’t bleed or anything but it stung horribly. I immediately went home and cleaned it/put antibiotic ointment on it. I am a bit confused as to what kind of wound it is, though? I can’t feel anything when I run my finger over it (like it has no texture, it’s smooth and feels no different from my skin). It doesn’t bleed. It has a pretty weird pattern (which might not be obvious in the photo). It doesn’t hurt when I apply pressure to it or when it touches things.

gyxjqo,12 hour shifts on my feet; what can I do?,"I've recently started a warehouse job that involves me working 12 hour shifts (my choice, and I can change to 8 hours if need be, I just prefer the 4 days on, 4 days off system) and it necessitates my being on my feet pretty much the whole time.  I have two half hour breaks, but obviously that doesn't make a very big difference.

Is there anything I can incorporate into my normal, vague fitness regime to make it less of a pain?

I've been doing leg stretches, but I'm not sure how effective they are.

gyxugj,Is this a tick bite?,"Hello, 

28F, 169cm 63kg, European. No medication.

I've had this weird dermatological thing happening on my left hip/close to the groin, I've noticed it a week ago. It started as just a red dot that I thought was nothing, and then in the next few days a red rash has been extending around it? (I'm putting a pic below). I'd say it's around 1cm long so quite small and has been the same size for the past 2 days. It's a little bit swollen and I can feel a slight burning/pain sensation (mostly when it's in contact with clothes though).

I've been using some antiseptic cream on it for the past 2 days just in case, but I've got no idea of what it is actually, never had a rash like that before.

gz0s66,I can hear my brain zaps,"Thank you for all the kind and positive responses, it can be quite a daunting task posting online, getting trolled etc - You have all been wonderful and I applaud everyone of us!

&amp;#x200B;

Hello,

I am (with my doctors blessing) going cold turkey on venlafaxine, I'm on a 200mg daily dose which took about 6 months to build up to, haven't had a good time on this medication at all - hasn't suited me.

I am experiencing what I believe are known as brain zaps, though my doctor called it ssri withdrawal syndrome, she said it isn't harmful - just very uncomfortable - to which I agree it really is quite uncomfortable!

My question is.. can anyone hear them? I've noticed with me at least, that if I move my eyes too fast I will get a zap, having them closed or open makes no difference, but, I can hear the zaps and it's a little odd, it sounds like something being dragged? it last only as long as a zap lasts, and on very very rare occasions I hear a really really loud crack.

Just wondering if anyone else is having this same thing?

A bit of info for the post to not be auto deleted.

I am a nearly 40 year old male from the UK, I smoke tobacco - used to heavily smoke cannabis for years (from 15 to roughly 35ish), I am 6ft 4in in height and weight around 12.5 stone. I have a decent diet. I have been suffering depression for maybe 2 years now - at least it was diagnosed 2 years ago.

Cheers and stay safe!

Edit: To clarify I am asking can anybody else hear their own zaps, I am confident there is actually no sound being created and it's a weird of the medication!

Edit: I am not overly concerned about these sounds - I feel like I can cope with the zaps and the sounds - I just wondered if it's a known thing or am I particularly lucky in my withdrawal symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all for you wonderful comments, it truly feels great to know I am not alone in my madness!

I'm 23 years old Caucasian Female, 5'1"", 192lbs today, 40H bust, 36 waist, 48 hips. Pre-diabetic but no other problems.

&amp;#x200B;

I admit I badly need to lose weight, but am struggling to figure out what a realistic ideal weight goal should be. Just found out I'm pre-diabetic, and know that anything will help, but want to know what I need to get to so I am furthest out of danger. My doctor was not helpful, just told me to try to get BMI below 25. None of the online tools I've found seem to take body shape into account, I have sizable chest and hips, and realize that will go down a little, but I can feel my hip bones right now and can't image losing much weight is some places is possible for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Using online tools they all put a healthy BMI and ideal weight about 100-130 lbs for me, and seems like 115 is the perfect weight I should be shooting for. That would be like 40% of my body weight! I don't see how my body could lose that without going all the way down to bone. I feel like considering my figure I should expect to have a much higher body fat %, like even if I was a lot slimmer and healthy.

gz3j9x,Blood and pus coming out,"Hi, I am a 30 year old male. I shaved my body hair a few weeks ago, including pubic area. Some days later I noticed a bit of a pain there - I didn't bother. Then the pain became stronger and I noticed that I had some sort of skin issue there, I think it looked like an ingrown hair. The issue never went away and became bigger and bigger - until it popped. I tried to get the pus out  by pressing from the sides towards the opening, but the pain was very bad. I tried putting in a needle type instrument and it could go easily in like 3-5mm before I felt anything. Now I keep a bandage on it with some ointment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnevsky_liniment). The area around is swollen (noticable in the pictures, specifically closer to the pubic area), approximately 5cm to each direction, but theres no pain if I press there. So far every day I disinfect with hydrogen peroxide or 40% alcohol and apply a bandage and the ointment.

Today I removed the bandage as it was very bloody and noticed that it looks like there are 2 ""holes"" - one is filled with pus (see pictures) and the other right next to it is with blood. The skin around it also looks weird. For the past few days it hurts for me to bend (the area gets compressed), I try wearing loose fitting pants/underwear. Sometimes it also just hurts to lay.

Maybe related, but in the past months I had 2 styes (one developed and was an issue and one went away underdeveloped), and also some kind of thing in my nose that developed and was very painful until going away (possibly similar to what I have now, but I was not able to see in the nose). I never had such issues in the previous years, but I remember when I was much younger I sometimes had styes.

Rash is located on my ankle and appears like this https://imgur.com/sGu6YBe 3 days after going for a hike with low shoes and ankle socks.  The trail was narrow but I never left it to walk through tall grass or bushes.  I never saw any ticks on my ankle but as soon as we got home I noticed it was itchy.  It started out barely visible but now, 3 days later, they're starting to look worse and I have a sore lymph node on the right side of my neck.  Is this lyme? or just some simple bug bites?

gz84h4,"Mother has been in the hospital for 2 weeks, and her cognitive ability greatly fades while talking over time. Anyone have an idea?","62yr old female, diabetic,  went into the ER 12 days ago with abdominal pain, illness. 

Because of covid, precise details are pretty limited, as we’re not allowed to visit. 

In the ER, they found infection, and removed part of her colon. A few hours before surgery, she became incoherent, and remained that way for roughly 5 days after surgery. 

They also said her kidneys were not functioning upon arrival, and was put on dialysis roughly 48hrs after her colon surgery. 36hrs after dialysis, she was awake, and though she had some strange stories, she seemed pretty good, for a bit. She was moved out of ICU within a few hours of waking. 

In the following days, we’ve had many phone conversations with her on her cell. I noticed she sounds like her normal self, for roughly the first 15-30 minutes. However, after that she starts a gradual decline. The best comparison I can give is she starts sounding progressively drunk, to the point where she says she has to go to sleep. 

I’ve asked her how she feels throughout that regression, and she says she feels fine, not really tired up until the very end, and unaware she’s slurring, or confused. 

This same has happened on at least 6 occasions I’ve been a part of. 

I came up with a theory that talking may be Interrupting her breathing, and her oxygen levels are gradually decreasing, possibly making her hypoxic. She is not on an oxygen monitor. 

I have no medical training though, and my thoughts mean jack to everyone. I’m a bit concerned the staff thinks she’s in better shape than she is, because they don’t converse with her long enough, and she’s doing everything she can to get out of there. 

Any ideas?

Edit:

Just to add. On two occasions, I have called her back 2 hours after she’s needed to hang to sleep, and she’s back to be her normal self, then fades again as described.",4,9,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gz84h4/mother_has_been_in_the_hospital_for_2_weeks_and/"")",2020-06-08 14:05:05,Physician Responded
gz9zym,Chronic folliculitis,"Hi all,

I have a picture in my post history of my folliculitis at its worst. 

I have been dealing with folliculitis since the beginning of last year and it has been a battle. It all started around the time I got back on birth control. Birth control that contained androgens (but I honestly can’t say if it happened before or after I got on birth control after being off for about a year). It all began with a few clusters here and there and now it covers my entire face neck and chest. Some days it looks better, like when I first wake up, but as the day goes on I develop more and more pustules that appear in clusters.

The first derm I went to prescribed me 5 different things and dismissed my claims about “fungal acne” saying it’s really rare. I was a little taken back so I didn’t reschedule. She also wanted to put me on Accutane and I was hesitant at the time because I had been on it before when I was 14 (I’m almost 27). I didn’t believe that could be a solution.

This new derm I am seeing put me on anti-fungals immediately. They initially helped, but it came back after my course. So I took another course and same thing. He ended up taking a biopsy of a little bump back and turned out it was not fungal or bacterial? Great lol. Idk what that means! 

The weird thing is that my folliculitis on my face and chest respond really well to Nizoral (which contains Ketoconazole) but when I used prescribed Ketoconazole wash it made it worse. The last time I was in the office I asked if he could take another sample, but this time of my face. He just kind of brushed it away and nothing happened with that. He ended up prescribing me Doxy because we had yet to try it and all hell broke lose on my face and chest. He also gave me Onexton. I’m almost a month into my Doxy and almost done with my pills, he said there would be no need to take another course. 

I spend SO MUCH time researching this issue because it really is a mystery wtf is going on. I recently read that some people have had success taking Accutane. I’m feeling hopeless. Derm told me to reschedule if Doxy doesn’t work.

Here are the things I’ve tried and am still currently doing: 

-  Changed all of my products, went fragrance free with everything. Frequently changing sheets. 

- No makeup since this mess started.

- No more fun hair products, only wash my hair with Nizoral.

- PanOxyl Wash and CLn body wash at the advice of my derm everyday. I use CLn face moisturizer. (Helps stay maintained).

- Nizoral face mask and clay masks (help a lot)! But just a temporary fix.

- Went off of birth control for few months (no change).

- Spironolactone (did not help).

- 2 courses of Fluconazole tablets and anti fungal cream (some change but didn’t go away completely).

- Doxycycline 100 MG and Onexton topical for about a month still actively on these. (so far has made it worse). Only relief has been Nizoral.

- Changed birth control to Yaz since Lo Loestrin contains androgens. Yaz is “anti androgen.” 
Eating a clean diet, cutting out refined sugars, gluten and dairy (only success is when I eat a diet of mostly salad, which is difficult to maintain. I lost a lot of weight). 

- I take probiotics every day, a garlic and candida cleanse. I also used to have severely low vitamin D so I take prescribed vitamin D.
Not the best at drinking water or working out but I am trying! 

I have never experienced this before in my life. This only started for me at age 25. Is my next step Accutane? Any advice or suggestions are appreciated.

gza9e4,Question about Steroid Creams,"Hello 22M I’ve been fighting a fungal skin infection (yeast) that was particularly persistent but now it’s almost entirely gone. Clotramazole (anti-fungal agent) mixed with the steroid betamethasone Dipropionate was what was prescribed to me and it did the job in terms of getting rid of the infection.  It came in lotion form.  The yeast infection was on the skin of my penis. 3 days ago, I noticed the skin color where I was applying the lotion changed slightly, which I understand is a side effect of steroid topicals. But after sex (my dermatologist gave me the green light) my penis was bright red.  Like super red. There was no pain I only noticed the redness after the fact. It returned to normal after some time.  Its been a week and a half of the lotion use, I was cleared for sex after week 1, after seeing significant improvement of the rash. I don’t know if I want to continue finishing out the lotion if it’s gonna make my penis super red. Was thinking about just using OTC clotramazole (Lotrimin) to finish out the course of treatment.  I’m going to give my dermatologist a call tomorrow but am looking for a second opinion if any can help. Also looking for ways to reverse the changes in skin color as well as the redness after sex/friction.  I’ve been using Aquaphor in between doses of the AF/steroid lotion hoping it helps.  

P.S. I don’t think the infection is what made it so red as I have been lathering the lotion on healthy skin nearby to prevent spreading, the healthy skin is showing the most signs of discoloration/redness. 

P.P.S. I was using a different Rx anti-fungal+steroid cream for a week prior to this treatment, I stopped bc it wasn’t as effective.",2,7,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gza9e4/question_about_steroid_creams/"")",2020-06-08 15:50:21,Physician Responded
gzaqs7,RH negative? pregnancy questions,"27f pregnant, no meds, healthy. 

Hi, all! I’m trying to gain some understanding before the next appointment so we can ask more productive questions. 

My wife is pregnant (9-10 weeks). On an ER visit around 6 weeks a doctor stated that because she was pregnant “You need to know you are RH negative. That’s important if you start bleeding.”

My wife is O+. Our sperm donor was O+. They did not do any tests that I believe would tell them the fetal blood type. 

What could he have been talking about? He specifically said she (mom) was RH-, but blood donations &amp; tests throughout the last 10+ years have always said she was O+. I understand baby could be O- still (25%ish chance, I think), but what blood test or urine test on mom would show baby’s blood type so early?

gzdh60,My finger is not broken but why can’t I use it?,"21 year old female. 
I got attacked by a dog about three weeks ago, one of the bites was on my middle finger on my dominant hand. There were two puncture wounds on either side of my middle finger, directly across from each other so- bottom and top teeth. I have been attacked by several dogs and nothing ever comes from ER visits except for antibiotics. So I decided I wasn’t going to go. After about four days the swelling didn’t go down even while it was splinted so I decided to see if it was fractured after reading things online stating you can still in fact slightly move a broken finger. So, I went in, got an X-RAY and no breaks, fractures or otherwise. I got antibiotics and got it splinted again. 

Fast forward to present time- I haven’t regained much function or range of motion. I keep it unsplinted to try and move it again, but every time I slightly move it out of habit I get an excruciating pain in my finger and up my hand. I can only close it about 40% while trying to make a fist. The swelling is still nearly double the size of my middle finger on the other hand. 

Am I going to regain function soon? How long do these types of injuries take to heal? The external wounds aren’t quite healed yet either. It isn’t broken or infected so why isn’t the swelling going down?

But she's sending me to a neurosurgeon. She wants the neurosurgeon to further evaluate my scans.

gze4il,Alternative Breast Reduction Surgery,"Hey Doc,

I am 28 year old cis female. 220lbs, 5'8"" from USA. I have already consulted surgeons on two separate occasions about getting a breast reduction and I have been told that I am an ideal candidate. I currently wear a 36 G/H. I have drooping breast with downward pointing nipples. No children but I want them in the future but I can't live with these boulders any longer. They are heavy and cause pain in my back and shoulders. I want to get down to somewhere between a C and DD but I am aware that only so much can be removed. I smoke weed but no cigarettes and I don't take any medication. 

Here is my proposal. I am very familiar with all current forms of breast reduction surgery. Other doctors have suggested that I do the lollipop incision or the anchor incision. I'm aware that these procedures are done from the underside of the breast to reduce the appearance of scarring. However, they are very invasive and run at high risk of losing nipple sensation or breast feeding function. 

 Most of the skin on the top of my breast has lost all elasticity and is highly stretched with stretch marks. The skin under my breasts however is still stretchy and still has its elasticity. I find it a huge waste to remove the healthy elastic tissue under the breast instead of removing the stretched skin on top of the breast.

 What I'm proposing is an alternative surgery where the incision is made on the top of the breast and breast tissue is taken out from above then the skin is pulled up to create a lift. in this case the scars would go from the armpit down to the cleavage on the top side of the breast instead of the bottom. I know that many people are not comfortable with scars but I find them beautiful and would prefer this surgery because I believe that it would reduce the risk of issues related to the nipple. It would also preserve all of the healthy breast skin that is below and still has its elasticity while removing all of the skin that has been stretched and will no longer bounce back. 

I WOULD LIKE SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO FIND A SURGEON WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO EXPLORE THIS ALTERNATIVE FORM OF SURGERY WITH ME. 


NOTICE: I have done extensive research on all of the current forms of breast reduction available so please don't suggest that I just use one of the current forms I'm looking for something different that suits me personally. I am confident that there are other women, like me, who want to keep their nipple function and sensation and don't mind having scars or even prefer to have scars. I am seeking this out for not only for my own benefit but for those, like me, who feel that they have no other option. 


If you know anyone or any hospital that would work with me I would really appreciate the suggestions and the contact information. If you are one of these surgeons I just want to say I volunteer as tribute. I think this is a good opportunity to give women other options in terms of breast reduction surgery.

Been applying OTC hydrocortisone 1% and clotrimazole cream 1% 3x a day. Doc said to do it for 14 days. It's been 11 and I dont feel like I've really see any improvement yet in fact the discoloration and blotchiness seems like its spreading.

I also didn't think much of it before but I have had a whiteish bump inside my bottom lip that has been there for a few weeks at least, not sure if that info is relevant.

I just had a follow up today and she prescribed triamcinolone acetonide which I thought was a cream to put on my lips but it's actually a dental paste....? I dont see how this is going to help me.

Should I be worried that my regular skin pigmentation hasn’t returned? Should I limit my sun exposure time outside? What should I do?

gzg4gp,Regular night sweats?,"20F 162cm, 47kg, non smoker/drinker/drug user, 40mg citalopram daily, caucasian

Over the last few months I’ve been seemingly out of nowhere getting drenching night sweats, which has been waking me up in the middle of the night, perhaps a few times a week. 

Tonight was probably the worst I’ve had where I am dripping which is making me feel like surely it can’t just be due to being too hot at night?

I sleep in a cool room (UK), with a thin duvet, I’ve stopped wearing anything in bed to help keep me cooler or switch to just a blanket too instead of a duvet, and in general I feel cold throughout the day even on warm days, so I’m not convinced I’m simply too hot during the night. 

Also I’ve been taking anti-depressants for a year and never had this side effect until the past few months so I doubt it’s caused by that?

Just hoping to find an answer so can hopefully get some decent sleep again lol, thank you!!",1,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gzg4gp/regular_night_sweats/"")",2020-06-08 21:43:57,Physician Responded

gzg8qu,Headache is killing me.,"Recently,  I've been starting to have this headache that come and goes. But when  it comes, it really feels like my head is about to explode, or getting  stabbed by a knife or something, repeatedly. The pain is unbearable. I'm (22M) around 5ft10, weighs around 150lbs, I do not smoke. What's weird is I'm a sportsperson, I do not have a history of any health issues, nor did I ever fell over and hit my head, but this headache recently is really killing me.

The  first time that this happened was at March, the pain lasted for 4 days  and the pain gets worse when I bend over, look down, or lie down, so technically for 4 days, I never had a good sleep at all. So I went to  the doctor and the doctor said might be a migraine attack, and  prescribed me some naproxen sodium to take. But that didn't help at all. After 4 days the pain slowly went away. Then came the second time which lasted for 3 days, then the third time, the fourth. Each time the pain  is worse than the previous times. And finally yesterday, where I went  back to the doctor, and he gave me another med to take, which according to him is lighter than naproxen. So I went home, took the tablets, and  went to sleep, although I didn't really get to sleep cause as soon as I  lie down my head feels like it's about to explode, so I slept sitting up.

People have been suggesting me to go have a CT scan or something, but before I have to go that way, I  would like to ask here if anyone has any idea about my issue cause CT scan in my country is not exactly cheap. Any recommendation or  suggestions would really help me.

gzgqm1,Chronically raw and crusty earlobes,"I (29F) have had issues that come and go (both long and short periods of time) with my ears for my entire life. Average weight for my height and I have no health issues other than depression (lamictal, Wellbutrin, and cymbalta) and spironolactone for acne—regardless, this problem predates all medications I have taken in my life. I live in the south now, but I am from a temperate climate and this has happened at some point during every season. 

The recurring issue I have is cracked, weepy, crusty, and sometimes bleeding (detached) earlobes. The split between my lobe and jaw will become cracked, raw, and crusty and the back of my lobe will become raw, dry, and flaky. When I was younger, the curve of my ear used to do the same, except even worse—to the point where where my glasses would get stuck to my ears. When my mom took me to the doctor as a kid, they just told us to put ointment on it. 

Lately, it’s been happening again. I have had stretched lobes for the past 15 years (have gone up and down in size but treated my ears well) and have always kept them well moisturized with things like vitamin e oil, jojoba oil, aquaphor, and Neosporin, for the brief periods of flare up. Recently, the dryness got so severe that I had to take my plugs (1/2”) out completely. I’ve been (alternating) putting antibacterial ointment, aquaphor, lotion, and oil on it to no avail. Nothing seems to be helping. I’ve tried so many different combinations and solo applications but nothing seems to help.

gzhha1,Weird Mostly Circular Lesion (Popliteal Fossa),"30 year old female, approximately 67 kg with a history of autoimmune disease (Crohn's and in remission if pertinent) and hyperparathyroidism with elevated serum calcium - and currently six months postpartum if that makes any sort of difference.

I noticed this little lesion on May 6th - it's smooth and not raised from the skin in any noticable way. Now, on June 8th, it's increased in size and developed that little ""tail"" over the last two weeks. Image for reference at the bottom of the thread.

No texture change from my surrounding skin to it. There's no pain or itching. I try to focus on it real hard, I guess it gives me a bit of a tingle now and then but I think that's  my anxious little brain wanting to put something there.

I've been seen by urgent care and attempted treatment for suspected tinea with Nystatin and clotrimin with no lasting effect. It's the ""lasting effect"" thing that's a little bizarre, in that I'm not 100% sure if it's medication or rest that provides intermittent fading.

I work at a community hospital as a nurse for 12 hour shifts. On my days off when I'm able to be more attentive and apply topicals (and rest) it starts to get lighter and fade and then when I have to go to work by the end of the shift it is always darker again and sometimes larger. On work days, I only miss one to zero applications so I'm beginning to wonder if stress or exercise might be a component worth considering in terms of exacerbation.

My anxious, silly brain likes to think that everything is cancer or otherwise Very Bad (it's worse than Web MD). You all are the real doctors and might be able to either give me some peace of mind or tell me if I really need to hit the panic button on this. I'm attempting to get in to see my dermatologist regardless, but there's at least a one week wait.

It's my hope that posting this thread will get me to stop ruminating on the subject like an idiot by having some direction to go with it. Thank you for your time and expertise.

It hurts, a lot, and It's gotten better with some PT, but right now my  PT place is closed and the home work they've given me isn't really doing  it, so my doc has me back on the Nortriptyline at a low dosage (75mg).

I've  gotten used to often forgetting little things, like if I'd already put  the mayo on my sandwich, that sort of thing. I have a really had time  concentrating to get work done, but I can generally manage. This last  few days, though, have somehow gone to the next level.

On  Thursday of last week I stood up to put more paper in my printer and  when I got there, paper in hand, I had no idea where I was, what I was  doing, and who my buddy who was there was. It lasted for about ten  seconds and then I figured it out.

Then  the next day I went to get the mail and made it out the front door and  the same thing: I had no idea who I was, or what I was doing, or how I  got there.

I'm terrified of things  like this because my brain's really all I've got going for me. In  addition, both of my grandparents on my dad's side recently died of  Alzheimer's and it was so utterly depressing seen that disease progress.

I'm  hoping that these are just symptoms of the Nortriptyline, not the other  bad thing. I'm considering making a doctor's appointment.

My 74 year old mother came out in an extremely itchy rash approximately 18 months ago. The itching can drive her to be physically sick. She has been reasonably healthy all her life, with a case of rheumatic fever at age 8, one parathyroid removed at age 56, and at age 70 started Candestatin 8mg x 1 daily for blood pressure, Metrorolol Tartarate 50mg 1/2 tablet twice daily for tachycardia, and Eutroxsig 100mg x 1 daily for her Parathyroid replacement.  Her blood results are normal. GP has tried 18 months of steroid creams and Telfast, which has made no improvement.
A specialist has suggested this is an inflammatory skin disorder caused by varying her medication between different generic types and brand names. He prescribed a six month course of Azythromicin, however within 10 days her liver function became quite critical, and she was immediately removed from it.
Her GP has now prescribed hydroxychloroquine in a “guess” that maybe it is lupus, and today when I have taken photos, her legs are looking quite good. Should it be hot, and she moves around, she is in agony with the itching again.
After 18 months, I am desperate to see if anyone can help, if a doctor has seen something similar. With many thanks.

gzkm6q,I have 2 questions for any eye doctors out there,"
Hi I am 30 years old, 4'11"" , 96 lbs female with no major health issues except iron defiency anemia. I take iron, a multivitamin, will start taking Omega-3 supplements. I eat pretty healthy.

So I went to an eye doctor Saturday since I felt like I had an infection. ( Started noticing dryness, itchiness, slight headache last Wed evening that got better with lubricating eye drops, but Friday started feeling slight pain on right eye) 

He examined my eyes and said yea only on the right one.  I also let him know that I saw this tiny white pimple like thing on my plica semilunaris ( upon doing some research online I think that's what the area is called )
I didn't know the term when I was at the doctors office at the time.
At first he didn't see it and then when he looked again he said oh,"" that's common when something gets in your eye that the eye doesn't like"" and he said a medical term for it starting with either a ""c"" or a ""k"" and I am not sure but it sounded more like the word started with a ""c"". Does anyone know what he meant or what any pimple like thing on that area is?

He prescribed tobramyacin/ dextramethasone  and also ketorolac just for the right eye.
I am only taking the tobramyacin since that is the antibiotic and also the ketorolac wasn't available at the pharmacy the day I went to get it, but today it is. Upon research I see that the ketorolac is only a pain killer and it has some side effects I don't like so I don't really want to take it if I don't have to. Do you think I can skip the ketorolac and just keep taking the tobramyacin?

I know my post was kinda long but I really appreciate if you read this and care to respond.",2,15,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gzkm6q/i_have_2_questions_for_any_eye_doctors_out_there/"")",2020-06-09 03:38:01,Physician Responded

gzot99,"In the last few months, my eyesight has gotten way worse","I am a 30 year old female, weigh around 250 pounds (obese), with a history of anxiety, PTSD, bipolar, and borderline personality disorder. I take abilify, mirtazapine (new, started less than a month ago, so unrelated to this), propranolol, prazosin, klonopin, a multivitamin, and vitamin D supplement. Everyone in my family except me wears glasses.

In the last few months, I have noticed my eyesight has gotten way worse. It's strange. I can look at road signs and comprehend what they say because I can make out the general shape of the letters, but in general: I can't actually see what the letters are until I'm close up.

I also noticed this when I'm reading, I have to hold the paper closer to my face than usual so I can see what I'm reading.

A few years ago I had an eye exam and was told my eyes ""fight for dominance"" between each other and it takes me an unusual amount of time to focus my eyesight, the doctor told me that my eyes were nearly perfect vision however and I didn't need glasses - just that at that time, I should know that my vision will get worse as I age. 

I haven't gotten an eye exam yet because I can't afford it and I don't have insurance (currently out of work due to Covid). 

I'm wondering if this could be a side effect of one of my medications? 

I know it could be related to like, Diabetes, but my mother-in-law is diabetic and let's me use her blood sugar machine and my blood sugar is always between 90 - 100 so I don't think I am diabetic.  My a1c was tested last year and it was normal (5.5).

gzpi8o,Are seizures possible in a spot removed from the brain?,"Female, 40, 240 lbs USA

Trileptal 300mg 2x a day

Hello, I had my left temporal and occipital lobe removed in June 2011 and recently started having odd feelings that remind me of focal seizures. However, one in particular felt like it was in the exact area that was removed from my brain. Is that even possible? My symptoms were a very hot feeling in that spot, along with a very weird pressure (like someone was holding me under water), inability to speak or focus, dizziness, and then very tired. Lasted for about 30 seconds I think but not sure since I was the only one there. 

All of my other possible seizures (never found on eeg but it took me over 4 years to get diagnosed because of that), are a lot lighter feeling and longer, about 1-4 minutes. With those I can still look around and focus but can't speak and just get mildly tired. 

If it matters, they only went in to remove my left temporal lobe but my brain damage extended further than that. I had several tonic-clonics but were never caught on EEG. My most logged seizures per day was 29. None of my seizures ever showed up on EEG until I started to have the tonic - clonics and by then I was told it was too late because none of the medicines helped me and my seizures just kept getting worse.

I told my neurologist and she took away my driving privileges for 3 months. I'm hoping it's not possible to have seizures in that spot and it's just anxiety?

I’ve taken about 2 rounds of iron supplements so far and I’m into a third. Taking the iron supplement is problematic for me so if I don’t need it I really don’t want to take it. 

My symptoms were heavy, long, periods leading to excessive blood loss. Then I began to be tired all the time, incredibly fatigued, have trouble falling and staying asleep as well as waking up. I also sometimes get dizzy/light headed, poor circulation, headaches, and I’m very very pale (sometimes been told I appear to be ‘grey’).

Where I’m confused is 2 of the docs at my pediatrics office (my listed PCP and another doc who I see most often) say I’m anemic, and have dangerously low levels. However I once saw a diff doc at this office for this issue and she said something about it just being low iron stored and I wasn’t anemic/nothing was really wrong.

He went to a doctor today and was tested for COVID because of his symptoms and his doctor noted that his tonsils were swollen. He was tested for strep and flu which both came back negative, and COVID (the results will come in tomorrow). I was just curious if swollen tonsils is a sign that he might not have COVID? I cannot find any information online that the two are related. Thanks!

Also, I am aware that we will have his test results soon but I am asking because our house is very small and it has been stressful trying to figure out how we will accommodate/isolate him if he is positive, so it would be nice to have a good indicator.

gzslt7,Tips on safely getting enough sun? How much sun even IS enough?,"My wife and I live in the Great Lakes States region. Most people in this region dont get enough vitamin d which is absorbed from the sun. Normally my wife and I dont worry to much about this since we tend to forage a lot. This year though between corona virus getting people out to the woods and an odd wet spring creating a BILLION mosquitos, we are not foraging too much. I want to make sure we get enough sun, so for the first time in our lives my wife and I are considering doing a little sun bathing. I know obviously we need to put sunscreen on (especially as my wife tends to just BURN and quickly) but outside that, is there much we can do to protect ourselves from the sun? If we lay in the shade are we still absorbing enough vitamin d? How long is even enough time to properly absorb some vitamin d? I can provide more specific details if needed.

1. Complete marrow replacement of the L5 and S1 vertebral bodies with pronounced epidural soft tissue resulting in severe spinal canal stenosis.
There is also severe bilateral foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 and L4-5 on the left. The appearance is suspicious for diffuse tumor infiltration secondary to metastatic disease, myeloma, or lymphoma. Discitis/osteomyelitis with epidural phlegmon is considered less likely. Biopsy of the L5 vertebral body adjacent soft tissue of the L4 and further analysis.
2. Mild central canal stenosis at L4-5.

MR L-Spine W/O Contrast
COMPARISON: Abdomen and pelvis CT dated 11/30/2019. CLINICAL HISTORY: Lumbar radiculopathy.
TECHNIQUE: Sagittal and axial T1 and T2-weighted noncontrast images were obtained of the lumbar spine.
FINDINGS: There are 5 lumbar type vertebral bodies. There is normal vertebral height and alignment. There is diffuse signal alteration within the L5 and S1 vertebral bodies extending into the sacral ala. There is also abnormal soft tissue extending into both neural foramina and the ventral epidural space resulting in severe narrowing of the spinal canal from the superior endplate of L5 to mid body of S1. This likely compresses the traversing L5 and sacral nerve roots. Note is made that this is suboptimally evaluated without postcontrast imaging. There is extensive into the paraspinal soft tissues bilaterally at L5
with abnormal soft tissue interposed between the L5 vertebral body and psoas musculature, left greater than right. This extends superiorly to the level of
the L4-5 facet joint on the left.
There are no additional foci of marrow signal alteration. There is severe disc space narrowing at L4-5 and L5-S1 with milder disc degeneration at the levels. There is redemonstration of bilateral renal cyst was with the largest measuring
    
3.5 cm in the lower pole of the right kidney. No significant retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is identified. The conus terminates normally at the level of L1.
L5-S1: As noted above, there is severe narrowing of the spinal canal secondary to pronounced epidural soft tissue displacing the sacral nerve roots
posteriorly. There is effacement of the lateral recesses and both neural foramina.
L4-5: There is mild broad-based disc bulge and a small left central annular tear. There is also mild to moderate facet arthrosis. There is mild narrowing of the central spinal canal and right neural foramen. There is abnormal soft tissue resulting in severe left foraminal stenosis
L3-4: There is no focal disc abnormality or significant stenosis. There is mild facet arthrosis.
L2-3: There is no focal disc abnormality or significant stenosis. There is mild facet arthrosis.
L1-2: Unremarkable. T12-L1: Unremarkable.

I was unconscious for a few hours, had several seizures during that, and ended up in the hospital for a week. Luckily I didn't have any fractures or anything like that. Problem was I was rushed to an ER at a very poor facility that did not adequately address any of issues I told them I was having. I had sporadic care for 4 months until I got into a great facility network and had been seeing a neurologist for a long time. Problem was lot of MRIs ""looked good"" but I still had all the same symptoms. I still have seizures roughly 2-3 times a month, a constant, persistent migraine, weakness and pain on the left side of my body, balance and dizziness issues, blurred double vision, and more but I keep getting told my ""scans look"" good.

Is it possible for a brain to ""heal wrong"", like if you break a bone but don't get a cast it can ""heal"" but it's bent or what not, is that possible to happen to brain and why my scans ""look good""? I'm getting treatment but I just feel broken and at a loss because all this is happening still 2 years on and I don't know what else to do.

gztcuq,"Took minocycline ER to prevent potential chlamydia exposure, which was a mistake. How should I proceed?","Hey y'all,

I understand that this was very stupid. I am 24M, 5'11"", 170lbs, white, and I drink but do not smoke or use drugs.

I got chlamydia from the same partner 2 times in 4 months. We we both treated each time, though she was never retested the first time, but she was retested and negative the second time.

I did not intend to have sex with her anymore - she is never honest about her sexual partners or protection that she uses. However, I was drunk recently, and she asked to come over... long story short, we had unprotected sex, and I immediately felt anxiety when I woke up.

I found out that minocycline can treat chlamydia (and gonorrhea, though less of a concern), so I decided to take the minocycline ER that I had been prescribed for acne. I was taking \~100mg ER twice per day for 2 days. The pills were 65mg, so I was taking 1.5 twice per day. However, I am obviously not a doctor, so I neglected to consider that minocycline IR is used to such infections, while ER's use is generally limited to acne.

I'm concerned that this is a VERY bad idea now. It is unlikely that I got an STI from her again, anyway, and it might not even have been chlamydia if I did....

Should I just stop? Should I continue?

HEIGHT: 5’11”

CURRENT SYMPTOMS
Recurrent diarrhea for the past ten days

As of yesterday, I have been dealing with gas issues. Constantly burping and my upper abdominal just feels so blocked. My heart beats fast. My mouth begins to water and I have to go vomit (today is Day 2 of vomiting). 

Although I tried to take it light today (Gatorade and water), I still had to vomit.

I have lost 10 pounds as well

WHAT MY DOCTORS HAVE DONE SO FAR
They have prescribed:
(a) Omeprazole (b) Ondansetron

They sent me to do stool cultures for various bacterias and viruses. I’m personally fustrated because I desperately would like to start antibiotics.

Also nervous because my uncle has Chronn’s disease, but I am trying not to think negatively. 


POTENTIAL BACTERIA SOURCE
(A) Anal Oral Sex 
Essentially “eating ass”/ “ass to mouth play”

(B) Anal to Mouth Sex Toy Play
I put my personal dildo in my mouth.

The dildo must have had to been dirty. I had just recently played with it before douching and before my partner came over. While having sex, he reached over trying to do something “spontaneous.” I knew in the moment something was off, but it was my bodily fluids, so I opted in and sucked it for a bit. 

Is this possible ?

gzved2,"Jaw Pops, then starts clicking (18M)","So after noticing a cavity on my upper back left molar a few months ago, I developed this clicking in the left side of my face right below my ear every time I move it to the right. Later on, the area of my cheek surrounding the tooth would start to hurt, and my masseter muscle would become a bit bigger and be hard as a rock.

It's been a while, and the random pain has stopped pretty much entirely, but it's become a regular occurence for me to wake up, notice that my jaw movement is really stiff (not to the point where it's hard to talk or eat, I just feel like It moves much slower than usual), and what usually works is I put a finger between the gap from the back of my jaw to the middle of my ear on the left side of my face, and try and push in as I move my jaw to the right. After a couple tries my jaw will pop, and Ill be able to move my jaw normally but the clicking will return. If I move it again (finger or not) after it pops, I can hear a sort of wooshing or squelching sound? It's either one or the other with no apparent pattern.

 If I had to give a comparison to convey what the sounds are like, I'd say the ""woosh"" sounds like I just wiped my hand across a bedsheet, or maybe tightened my shoe laces. While the other noise is kinda like sucking spit through your teeth. The stiffness returns (and the popping stops) whenever I'm laying on that side of my face, like if I'm scrolling through things on my phone while in bed for an extended period of time, I'll have to pop it again to free up my jaw movement, and upon doing so, bringing back the clicking. Also something  I've noticed is that recently I'll get a feeling like the area around the tooth is really dry, or it kind of burns as I hear the clicking.


Due to my moving situation, I cant get to a dentist any time soon, so I was hoping I could find an explanation here.

This would be the second time I’ve had an episode of these itchy and painful patches.  The last time was in the fall and I went to urgent care when they started to blister because the looked a lot like shingles at the time and were accompanied by a cold sore and lymph nodes in neck felt swollen 2 days prior.  I was told they were hives from being outside the weekend prior and given a week long course of steroids.  The rash did clear up after 2 weeks leaving scars, but it’s unclear if it was helped by the steroids, or cleared on its own.

This time I haven’t been outside or in contact with any new products for skin or laundry, etc.  I did not have a cold sore this time, nor did I notice any swollen lymph nodes in my neck like before. The rash itself seems to be milder than the last time, fewer bumps over less area.

Saturday, I had one on my right hand, but they seems to be spreading because I have them over my forearms and moving up to my shoulder blades as of today (Tuesday) where I can feel the tingly itch starting, but I don’t have the bumps there yet.  They also haven’t blistered yet like last time, but they look identical otherwise and are instead sunken in the center.

I have an area of broken skin on my forearm from a dog scratch that has also now become raised and itchy like the bumps.  

They are flat plateau shaped rather than domed and irregular but round.  I don’t know of any underlying medical conditions that I could attribute them to,  although I do have HPV and am also prone to cold sores on my lip a few times throughout the year.

gzwl1a,Concerns about long-term effects of anesthesia on learning and memory.,"Hi, I am an adult in my late 20s and will likely be having a procedure done under general anesthesia. I have had three other procedures done under GA before, but this one will be the longest, at about 3 hours. The type of surgery will be a laparoscopy to repair an obstructed ureteropelvic junction. 

I am a software developer by profession and am constantly tasked with learning new languages and tools to compensate for a lack of developers on my team who are proficient in them. Due to this, I am expected to learn them fairly quickly and continue work, which requires fairly strong memory skills and cognitive abilities. 

I am concerned about the possible effects surgery will have on my cognition and the ability to perform successfully at work accomplishing mentally demanding tasks. I am by no means as sharp as I was 10 years ago, but I attribute that to the natural aging process and not previous anesthesia. I have read several studies, however, that indicate anesthesia (or surgery in general) may affect cognition. The conclusions in the studies range from an insignificant impact to noticeable changes. Another issue is that these studies focus on age extremes, with subjects being either very young or very old.

tl;dr: Are there any concerns about potential deleterious effects on cognition from general anesthesia in young adults?",1,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gzwl1a/concerns_about_longterm_effects_of_anesthesia_on/"")",2020-06-09 14:24:22,Physician Responded

starting about 2 weeks ago, i was having headaches and pain in my jaw right in front of my ear that radiated up the sides of my face. i was mostly concerned because my molars were hurting and it was unusual. i went to medexpress and was told i had fluid in my ears as well as drainage in my throat and was given steroids. i was told it was probably a little virus or from allergies. i felt a bit better after 2-3 days of steroids but when i finished the 5days of steroids, i really didn’t feel any better. i then was given antibiotics and a higher dose of steroids that haven’t helped even though i’m on my 5th day. i slept about 13 hours last night and could keep sleeping. i’ve noticed that my left side is much worse and i feel like i am salivating much more on the left side of my mouth. the steroids are making me feel like crap with a racing heart, upset stomach, trouble sleeping, etc. but i can’t tell what is from something not being right and what is from the steroids. i just don’t feel well and i know that. 

i have an appointment to see an ENT doctor on friday morning but i am not sure if they will know what’s going on considering i feel generally achy and fatigued. i’m really worried there’s something going on that i am not even considering. please help",2,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/gzwqxw/jaw_pain_and_general_body_ache_sleeping_12_hours/"")",2020-06-09 14:32:16,Physician Responded
gzwzwe,Fainting at temperature change. Why?,"I am a 19 year old female from Northern Ireland (the UK). I am approximately 5’0”, about 9st. I don’t smoke, have no known medical conditions other than depression, which I have been taking citalopram for since a little before last Christmas. 

For the past year or two, I get incredibly lightheaded and dizzy after getting out of a hot bath or shower, which has caused me to faint quite a few times. 

The first time I ever fainted was in the shower 1.5 or 2 years ago. The day before I had hit my head on my bedpost after tripping and falling over. It was a pretty hard hit and my head hurt where I had hit it but otherwise I felt completely fine. It bruised and the spot was tender for a few days, the same as if I had hit an arm or knee. The next day I took a shower and the pressure of the water hitting that spot made me lightheaded, so I got out of the shower and sat down but ended up passing out. I fainted a couple other times after that but it was seemingly out of the blue and over the next few months. 

Ever since then, occasionally when I get out of a hot bath or shower into the cool air, I get really lightheaded and dizzy and sometimes pass out. Sitting down and doing minor breathing exercises helps it pass within a minute or two and keeps me from fainting. It didn’t happen for about six months there so I thought it had stopped, but it suddenly happened again yesterday. It doesn’t happen in any other situation in which my temperature is raised. 

I know other people who faint and one of them (who has no underlying medical conditions, they’ve been checked out by doctors) says that since the first time they fainted, they just do sometimes. Do you think that’s what this is? Just the result of fainting once and, having initially occurred in a hot shower, my brain subconsciously connects the two? Or is there the possibility of a medical condition here? My student nurse friend has practiced taking blood pressure on me and it comes back normal. I had blood tests last year and they set off no alarms. 

I’m not particularly worried, more so asking out of curiosity than panic as I can’t find anything to explain this fully. Please help me to satiate my curiosity (or tell me to get my ass to a doctor if needs be). Thanks in advance. 





TLDR: I hit my head a while back. Passed out in the shower next day. Continues to happen sometimes when I get out of a hot bath or shower into the cool air. What?

gzx013,"Amitryptyline/TCA alternative for treating headaches, weight gain","About me: 26F, 5'2""

I've had chronic tension headaches ever since I can remember. Years ago I went to see a neurologist and he prescribed me Amitryptyline, which I have been taking ever since. He technically prescribed 30mg a day, but I am currently only taking 10mg. The amitryptyline helps a lot, as I used to have about 3-4 headaches a week, but now I only have 2-3 a month.

I've also always been slightly overweight (BMI 25-30). However, since going on amitryptyline I've gained about 30 pounds, and now my BMI is 30+, which I know is definitely not healthy. Over the years I've tried many many things to try and lose weight but none of them have worked. I even trained for and ran a half marathon 3 years ago, but looking back at my weight/body composition record, I didn't lose any weight at all through those months of training.

Lately I've been doing intermittent fasting (eating only between 12PM-8PM), and eating healthier. I've also been doing cardio (dancing) and weight training for 45-60min every single day. However it's been about a month and the scale has not been budging, if you don't count the fluctuations. I have a scale that measures body fat percentage and that has only gone down about 1 pound.

I know that I can't attribute my lack of weight loss directly to amitryptyline, but I do want to try and wean off it or switch to an alternative to see if that will help. The only problem is that I tried to stop taking amitryptyline a few months ago, and my headaches went back up to 3-4 a week. I tried to just deal with it, but it was too much.

Is there a better way to wean off the drug (e.g., taking it every two days first, then gradually decreasing), or is there an alternative that won't possibly cause weight gain? Or, is there a way I can lose weight while on amitryptyline?

I started taking it every other day for a week, then every two days for a week, then every three days and so on for about two months.

The doctor gave me a cream initially, and it disappeared. It does respond to Triancinolone Acetonide Cream USP, 0.1, however, it comes back as soon as I stop using the cream. Any idea what this could be and what I should talk to my doctor about?

About 6 months ago I was traveling with friends and we used some party drugs (Molly). I took way too much and I was up for about 2 days in a row, and my heart was literally racing for about 20 hours. I am surprised I did not have a heart attack (I am in a my 20s and healthy so that is probably why).

Ever since that incident when I stand up from sitting down my heart racing a little bit. I do not believe I have arrhythmia but I might. My question is multi-pronged: If I go to my doctor and ask him to examine me concerning this will he report it to my job or the police? Will my insurance cover this because it involves street drug usage and heaven forbid, if my heart is damaged will I be ineligible for further treatment because of it stemming from drug usage?

gzxs6g,"Painful boil, 26 F, pointers to how to make it head and drain on its own?","Hello docs!

I'm 26F and I have one of those heat boils/boils due to infection (that people generally get on the inner thigh etc.) on the side of my breast since a few days. It's the kind where there's accumulation of pus under the skin and it gets very painful when it gets bigger, generally has a head like a pimple and usually pops and drains by itself.

I got this one due to me being unhygienic due to certain situations, plain and honest, coinciding with my period which gave me pimples all over (pimples happen every month, expected). My problem is, this one is one inch big at the moment. Although it isn't exactly growing since yesterday, I still do not see a head. It has bulged out over the surface and there are white areas there, but no discernible head. I tried reading up on it and the suggestion was to wait and let it pop on its own or visit a doctor for incision and drain procedure, but I do not wish to go to a doctor. Enduring this pain is kinda getting out of hand a bit, because it hurts every time the skin moves. And I can't sleep comfortably as well, so it's ruining my days and nights. 

Anything you can suggest to make it go away at home or endure the pain or make it head quickly? I have popped and sterilized a few I had in the past on the inner thighs and they were quite workable since there was a clear head, didn't scar too. I don't know what to do with this monster, sadly.

Hello,  I've been sitting on this question for months and months now, and now  the fact of it has hit me and in the past few days I've been stressing  about it alot.

I used to wear  headphones while gaming, around a few hours a day on weekdays (3-4  hours) and around 6-8 hours on weekends. This was around 5 months ago  and i used the same pair of headphones. They are the type of headphones  to sit on top of the head. I'm 16 by the way.

I  stopped wearing them as soon as i realised my head began to reshape and  leave a physical dip in my actual head, not my hair.  I haven't worn  them for around 5 months and I still feel the dip in my head. Should I  go to a doctor about this? I'm not sure if its the tissue of the head or  the actual skull, but I don't want it to be permanent.

I'm  100% sure i will be bald when i'm in my late 20s, due to my genetics,  and the thought of my head shape exposed to everyone really stresses me  out.

h008si,[22][M] Cosmetic surgery for busted lip injury 6 years ago,"6'2"" , 200 lbs, white

I was punched in the mouth 6 years ago and my top lip was split open on my right side (thanks dad). I didn't receive any medical attention or proper bandaging, and as a result, my lip has substantial scarring. The lip is much more firm at the point of scarring than anywhere else in my lip (deep scarring?), and the vermilion border is irregular and is a hotspot for acne which makes the scar much more apparent.

&amp;#x200B;

Is it common to have surgery to repair small scarred areas on the face? 

Is it possible that surgery would not return my lip to normal  and make the scarring worse?",3,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/h008si/22m_cosmetic_surgery_for_busted_lip_injury_6/"")",2020-06-09 17:40:11,Physician Responded
h0095l,High triglycerides at 26 - 455 mg/dl,"I’m a 26 year old female, 5’8”, 200 lbs, non smoker, no health issues, only medication I’m on is nuvaring birth control. 

I got a physical done for a new job and they did EXTENSIVE lab work. Like 6 or 7 vials of blood worth. I got the results today and of the two full pages of tests, the only one that was an issue was my triglycerides. They were an astonishing 455. I could stand to lose some belly fat, but otherwise I’m athletic and consistently work out (save for the last few months with no gyms). 

I fasted beforehand for about 10 hours. I plan on putting more focus back on my diet and exercise and taking fish oil, but now I’m panicking a bit. For the last month or so before my test, I had not been eating great and was drinking a fair amount. My boyfriend and I have been working from home, we were extremely stressed from being in the process of buying a home, and I was even more stressed because I was going through 3 rounds of interviews for multiple jobs. There was a lot of stress eating and packs of seltzer’s. I talked to my gyno and she said that being on nuvaring could have also contributed to making the number so high. I have an anxiety disorder as it is, and this is definitely making it worse.

Sex: male
Height: 5’11”
Weight: 165 lbs
Race: Caucasian
Primary Complaint: missing half eyebrow
Duration: slightly under one year
Medical conditions: none
Current medications: none
Drugs / alcohol: weekly drinker and marijuana smoker, occasional nicotine vape use

About a year ago, I woke up to a crescent piece of my eyebrow missing (I was alone, no chance of being shaved as a prank). Over the next month, my right eyebrow continued to lose hair until only 1/4 of it remained. About 4 months after this, my sideburn also stopped growing for a period, but resume growing as normal eventually.

I have not sought any help from a primary care doctor or otherwise as I wasn’t really worried about the cosmetic problem, though with it not growing back for this long I am concerned about potential causes. Is this something to be worried about and could I have greater problems going on? I had ringworm within a month of the eyebrow coming off.

h00kt1,Cardiovascular exercise makes me feel like I'm dying.,"18M- This may sound rather silly, but I feel like dying when I partake in cardiovascular exercise. In no way do I mean to boast when I say that I am very fit. I am 5'7 and weigh 135 pounds. My body fat percentage is 5.3 according to my physician last month. Back in highschool I was a wrestler and cardio was my ""jam"" if you will. But it has always felt like I was going to die after a certain point. That ""certain point"" has been diminished to merely nothing since I graduated and moved on. The symptoms I am experiencing even after very minimal exercise include: Nausea, severe dizziness, complete immobility, even an inability to think clearly or at all really, and my eyesight is probably the most bothersome part. The best way I can describe it is being sunblind. But it lasts for up to 2 hours after the exercise, making this the most long lasting symptom. The previous symptoms take about an hour to wear off. Keep in mind I feel perfectly healthy at all other times of the day. As a side note I vape nearly constantly on very high nicotine levels. Recently I've been smoking a considerable amount of marijuana as well (always in a tobacco leaf) please try not to just pin it on my bad habits because I've had this happen to me long before I had ever consumed either of those.

Then just today, I was eating a raw carrot (no history of prior allergies to anything), and after taking a bite my mouth started to ache in the same way again. I sneezed a bit while eating the carrot, if that helps at all. Very strange, as I have eaten raw carrots for all my life and never encountered this before.

I'm convinced I'm dying. Or am going to die. I've had really bad health anxiety since I was in kindergarten, and have always thought I was going to die at least once every month or so since then. It kinda fucking sucks. Anyway, this month's suspected condition is appendicitis. No idea why. Heard a few stories, heard it was painful and can kill you, and kind of flipped out. For about a week, the fear of having appendicitis was pretty mild. I'd stay up for only about 20 minutes each night worrying about it, and then just get distracted and fall asleep. Now, I'm up for hours, and can't stop thinking about it. The only symptom I have is pain. A 1-3 on the pain scale. Lower right abdomen. Of course, I freaked out when I felt it at first, and it's all I can think about now. I only feel it when I think about it, or have nothing else to think about. I noticed that the pain'll go to my right thigh sometimes, too. I'm fucking scared. I kinda feel like I have a fever, too, but I don't have a thermometer. I really don't want to have to tell my mom I think I have this, because she'll think I'm weird, and I'll just feel stupid. And I hate going to the doctor. She'll get annoyed because it interferes with her plans, and it's not like me to complain about stuff like this. Can you just not treat it? Will I die? I don't think I have it, but I do at the same time. What else could it be? Is there a way to tell what if it is appendicitis without going to the doctor? If so, how? I have so many questions, but Google can only answer so many. Stupid fucking useless organ. Why do I worry about everything? This is retarded. Why am I so scared of telling my mom I think I might have something? I haven't been to the doctor since the I was about 11, and I'm 14 now. I'm kind of freaking out right now.

h04f2b,Possible autoimmune disorder?,"Hi! I am a 22F, 5’6”, 135 pounds, caucasian, occasionally vape and drink, athletic, no current medication or medical issues. 

I have been having a variety of issues for the last year or so. 

In March, I had a sudden appendectomy. While in the ER, I had blood drawn and I peed in a cup for testing (before they figured out what was wrong with me). This showed a non-fasting blood (I had eaten about an 1hr - 1.5 hr before) sugar level of 185 and I had sugar in my pee. My doctor was wary that I had type 1 diabetes. 

In April, I went in for a full blood exam which showed that I had a normal blood sugar levels. Since then though, I am nervous that I either do have diabetes or a possible thyroid issue. Here are some of the other things I have been struggling with:
- Numbness in hands and fingers with temperature changed. This lasts about 10-15 minutes 
- My legs and feet fall asleep frequently. At least once every 2 days. 
- Hands and feet are much colder than the rest of my body. 
- Upper fingers are paler than the rest of my body and my finger joints are tinged blue. 
- Constipation. I am having infrequent bowl movements. 
- Bloating. 
- Facial skin issues that heal very slowly. Including acne as I am unsure if that points to anything. 
- Thirsty a lot. 
- Fatigue. 
- Slight insomnia. Could be due to outside factors.

So I just finished day 3 of having a cold sore. Day one started with tingling ended with the blisters, day two was blisters, and halfway through day three the blisters started popping. Now I’ve had cold sores for many years, at least 6 years that I can remember. Usually is follows the same route of tingling, blisters, and scabbing. But this time around the mid to end of day two I noticed it was painful to look down and when I felt along my jaw there was pain. I’m guessing a swollen lymph node. But I’ve never had this issue before, my lymph nodes don’t usually swell when I have cold sore or at least they don’t swell enough for me to notice. I checked and I don’t have a fever. My cold sore itself is also bigger and more painful this time around. It looks like I got punched in the face and have a fat lip. Should I be concerned that there are new and worse symptoms even though I’ve had cold sores many times before? 
I used any new medication on this cold sore that I haven’t used on previous cold sores. Medications like lysine or abreva that you can buy at Walmart.

Like there’s a line dividing a certain spot on my thigh, almost like a sunburn, yet that’s not where my swim trunks were. Also, it’s on my genitals a bit. Only see black fly bite marks on my calves where the rashes are circularly patterned, but then hive rashes on my thighs and forearms, but then on my chest and biceps, there’s a different rash. Varying spots and blotches of red that are still itchy, yet look different than the hive type rashes on my thighs. Also lymph nodes swollen.

Went to the doctors and he quickly said it was an allergic reaction, and shot my ass up with Pepcid and prescribed prednisone, and sent me on my way. 4 days later, no sign of improvement, whilst downing a ton of Benadryl. 

I feel like it may not be an allergic reaction due to the patterning of the rashes, and the lack of improvement.   The rash just stops at certain spots and is no where near other spots.

On February 28 I was sexually assaulted. I don't really feel comfortable discussing details but there were date rape drugs involved and things are a pretty unclear on how it went down, and I believe the perpetrator used a condom but I'm not a 100% sure. I'm not sure if this can be cleared up using dates and ultrasound dating scans, but I was afraid to ask my actual doctor in case she wanted to push for counseling or other assistance at this time. I'm just not ready for that right now. I may ask her at my next appointment but I'm still debating this at this time. I don't plan on terminating whether or not paternity turns out to be from the assault, but if that is the case I want to be forward with my boyfriend and let him know its potentially not his child. 

From February 25 to March 15, I did not have intercourse with my boyfriend. On April 22 I had a dating scan for my pregnancy. Following this I'm going to copy and paste everything from my report. Theoretically, if the bleeding on the 2nd of the month in March as I told the doctors, I know I have no reason to be concerned. However, the bleeding was very light and only lasted 5 days, which I never have for my periods so I thought it might be trauma related. I want to know if I am reading the report right. So on April 22, was I 6 weeks 6 days in gestational age, the conception date would be around roughly around the 19th of April? The ultrasounwas done transvaginally and the CRL size and all information are listed below. 

""Date of service: 4/22/20

Indications: Dates
OUTSIDE PRIOR DATING DATA:
Last menstrual period(LMP): 3/02/20
LMP based estimated date of delivery (EDD):12/07/20
First dating scan: 4/17/20
Estimated date of delivery (EDD) from first dating scan: 12/07/20

Technique: Real time scanning was performed of the fetus and maternal pelvic organs with image documentation. Endovaginal scanning was also performed to better visualize the fetus and maternal ovaries.

FINDINGS

A single live intrauterine pregnancy is seen. The measured heartrate is 133 bpm. The crown-rump length measures 0.9cm, corresponding to an estimated gestational age of 6 weeks 6 days. It is too early for detailed anatomic assessment. By visual inspection, the amount of amniotic fluid is within normal limits. No significant findings of subchorianic/perigestational hemmorhage are seen. 

Measurement variability in dating +/- 4 weeks by LMP,  +/- 7 days by mean sac diameter (use before 6 weeks gestation if crown-rump length not able to be measured), +/- 5 days by crown rump length (up to 8 weeks 6 days gestation) , +/- 7days by crown rump length (up to 13 weeks 6 days gestation).

Maternal organs: Ovaries are not seen. Limited images through the kidneys demonstrate no hydronephrosis. 

IMPRESSION: A single live intrauterine pregnancy is seen. 

No significant disrecepancy is found between the estimated gestational age based on these images and the estimated gestational age based upon the given prior dating. ""

Since then they have not left. I remember it happening to semi this extent months ago but went away the next day. Weeks later seems to almost go away but today back really white around it and seems to spread to the other side.

Sitting or laying down will make it go away until I stand up.

Now the dilemma is this. I have a high hip pelvic tilt. So my hip is up on the right side higher. I also have an anterior pelvic tilt.

I’ve been doing a lot of foam rolling, stretching etc. it seems to be almost gone until today. Only thing is I did sit up and my left knee started to hurt after walking. Lasted for hours but now right side way worse again today.

Two weeks ago I went to the doctor. She had no idea but at the time was more faded than right now. I told her what I’m telling you but has no clue. Said I could try hydro cortisone cream for 2 weeks 2x a day. But risky due to thinning.

h0ea8v,Is BP 135/94 normal for dentist-related anxiety?,"I went to a new dentist yesterday and had a BP of 135/94. When my new dentist came into the room the first thing he started talking to me about was my BP. I told him I was feeling a bit anxious to see a new dentist. He told me that even if I have a bit of anxiety, it’s very high and I need to get a medical release before they try to replace my current crown. He was speaking very sternly about it and not in a nice way??

Anyways I called the doctors at my University and they told me that my history of going to them this past year indicates perfect blood pressure, systolic between 116-120 and diastolic between 68-80. So then we talked about what they used to measure my BP and apparently those wristbands that you bring up to your chest are notorious for over estimating your blood pressure. So, unfortunately, I have to pay to get evaluated for hypertension and a medical release on top of a crown when my BP was initially over-read. 

The question I never asked my University doctor was whether it was actually normal for BP to be 135/94 in a state of anxiety? I didn’t even think 135 was that abnormal for systolic. I’m not sure about diastolic. He specifically told me that even with anxiety, it wouldn’t be that high for a 20 year old woman.

Meds: Amlodopine/Benazapril, HCTZ 50mg, clonazepam 0.5 mg daily, zolpidem 5mg a couple times a week. I've used Kratom, 2.4 mg four times over a couple weeks for arthritis, not in the last week. 

Sorry for the long post, but the answers are important to me. About 3 years ago, I had no noticeable symptoms, but my fasting blood sugar was running around 120 and my doctor said ""you're diabetic, you start metformin today."" I told her I'd rather try diet changes - I did, went back 3 months later and all my labs normalized. She said she was surprised, but I didn't need meds anymore. Gallstones were diagnosed, doctor said ""take it out"" about 2 years ago. I didn't want/couldn't afford surgery so I've tried to manage with diet. Occasional pain/diarrhea if I eat too much fat. Ended up in the ER after 3 slices of pizza and 3 beers on the worst night of my life in December 2018. I got fluids, opiates and a $1750 out of pocket bill (insurance paid twice that much) because they suspected a heart attack initially. 

Fast forward to now. I've been eating very poorly, hardly exercising for the last 10 months (because of injuries I can't afford treatment for and worsening depression). After eating, I've been feeling weak/tired, getting diarrhea. Noticed my fingers were waxy/red near nail bed. My blood sugar after eating was 173 the last two days, and this morning (10 hours after eating last) it was 143. I see my doctor in 3 weeks. I assume meds will be recommended again. So, I've got questions:

1) If I start on meds for diabetes, will I likely start feeling better immediately or does it take a while? I've heard stories about awful side effects, etc, but know it varies from person to person.

2) Any chance I could still fix this with diet, or does it sound like I absolutely need to go on medication? Or are there other steps to take before deciding? Anything I can do over the next month before seeing my doctor to change things quickly? Other thoughts?

h0fal5,32F Cyst on wrist fracture?,"Hi! 
(32F, 5’11” 135lbs, no health issues or medications)
I fell backwards and into my wrist hand flexed inwards (awkward fall) around 4.5 weeks ago.  I had bruising, swelling, pain but assumed a sprain so rested it at home and after around 2 weeks all bruising and swelling was gone. Most function is back today, but certain movements are still sore.
Yesterday however,  a large cyst started to form on my wrist where I hit it which weirded me out, I called doc who sent me to hospital for X-ray.
Turns out I had fractured my wrist, but it’s straight, and as it’s been almost 5 weeks already predominantly healed. When I asked what the cysty lump thing - I got a shrug. Was told there wasn’t much they (urgent care) could do.  So I asked when I could start doing yoga again and was told to rest it for another 2/3 weeks.
Just wanted to double check and get a second opinion that it will all heal fine and cyst will go away with a few weeks rest?  😂

No medications. 
Occasionally drink, don’t smoke. 

So I wear contact lenses every day anywhere from 10-16 hours and have for over a year for astigmatism and nearsightedness. They do tend to make my eyes feel dry but I use rewetting drops for contacts often or just take them out if it’s too bad. 
Last night I was removing my lenses and since then my left eye has been hurting and it feels like there’s something in my eye like sand or an eyelash but there isn’t. I thought maybe my eyes were just dry but my right eye feels fine. I’ve tried flushing it with saline solution and have been using my rewetting drops all day but it doesn’t seem to be feeling better. Right now, using the drops and saline actually stings briefly when I use them. 
I haven’t worn my contacts today because of this and have been wearing glasses. My eye isn’t super red and has since stopped watering but it still hurts to blink, have closed, and just in general is bothering me. I called my eye dr to make an appointment but they can’t see me as I work until 5 pm and they close so they suggested I can go to an urgent care to have it looked at. 
What I’m wondering is if that’s necessary, or if I can just wait it out and see if it feels better? My glasses aren’t quite strong enough anymore so I don’t like wearing them for extended periods of time and prefer contacts.

I'm a 25 year old male who's 100% certain that I have salivary gland C, I got all the symptoms and everything matches up too perfectly, it just can't be a coincidence unfortunately.

Last monday when I was having lunch , I began to feel a swelling under my tongue and noticed that there was a little dot in the middle and that it hurted a lot when I tried to swallow my food. I've also noticed a swelling on my throat, I think that it is where the nodes are located. Looking up the symptoms online, it became clear that this has something to do with my salivary glands.

As of now, the pain and the swelling have been decreasing day by day and I can now eat and chew and drink with no major problem although the bump is still there but I can't shake the feeling that this is something way bigger than just an infection. I went to the ER today but the doctor said she couldn't do anything about it , didn't saw anything worth the fuss and prescribed me an ibuprofen. I got photos of the swelling under the tongue if you need.

I've already booked an appointment for a ENT specialist next week but I'm not sure I can wait that long. This thing feels like a ticking time bomb and I don't want to wait till it's too late. I would really appreciate it if someone could help me, should I be worried , should I go to other ER, should I wait?

Fast forward to today I noticed it is starting to appear on the other fore arm as well. Currently only two small dots and not like this current one pictured. 

I wasn’t outside at all to get poison. My exposure to being outside is normally limited to cutting my grass but I do it via a riding mower. I always wear long pants and such when doing it as well. 

I looked around for tick bites or something because I got worried about that but haven’t found any signs or indications of one. No other symptoms besides this itchy rash. Doesn’t burn, just itchy. 

My wife did change fabric softener around the time that the rash appeared, we figured that out last night. But being it is only on my forearms, I don’t know if it could be that. 

Any ideas what this could possibly be? I’m getting cortisone tonight to try, but just wondering if I should be concerned.

Now the full info. In 2013 I had scabies and medicated it with permethrin. My skin itched afterwards and I was worried I still had scabies. Therefore I undertook full body treatment with the cream more *than 10 times* over the span of 2013 and 2014, maybe once every 2 months, because every time afterwards my skin kept itching. However, permethrin dries the skin pretty badly and the package said that it's recommended to moisturize your skin afterwards. I did none of that. 

The last time I used the permethrin cream was 2014. My skin itches since then. Constantly, every minute of my waking state and in this moment, random spots on the skin itch and it drives me really crazy but it's possible to ignore it but it comes with costs. I did much sweaty sport 2015 to destract myself from it. There are no rashes, no red spots, nothing visible anywhere. 

2017 I was at a dermatologist who did a test by scratching lightly with a tooth pick on my forearm. He waited couple of seconds and then red lines appeared, but not as thick and big like you see it on urticaria pictures, I would say 10x lighter. So he said it was ""urticaria factitia"" some kind of rarely form of urticaria. He then prescribed me loratadine, I took one pill a day for a month and maybe or not (placebo?) it helped, but it still itched and itched. 

Sometimes I eat nothing for several days. After day 2 or 3 the itching kind of fades away a little bit and I become relaxed but as soon as I start eating anything, no matter what, lentils, buckwheat, rice or anything (pepper is the worst, paprika) my skin starts to itch again really bad. I developed an allergy against peanuts 2015 after eating 200g everyday for months. Otherwise I have no known allergy.

What's the solution? Get another anti histamine that works better than loratadine and which? See another dermatologist? Or Cream my skin, maybe it's still dry - although I showered etc all this years and the skin should be hydrated enough again? And then what cream? And doesn't it make all my clothing greasy and dirty?

Maybe you think I'm not taking this not seriously enough: I can't sit a minute and relax myself, I have to constantly tense my body, I stopped meditating for one reason because I couldn't relax my body, I can't fall asleep by just laying there relaxed, I have to tap a beat with my finger or toe to destract myself from the itching, concentrating on learning material is really hard if it's over a longer time span and I can't follow longer thought lines through or read a book because for that I'd have relax myself.

h0nivc,[Ontario] [22M] Sick for over a month. I have internal shivers and can feel my heartbeat throughout the body very often.,"So I have been sick for over a month and my common symptoms are I can feel shivers internally in my torso and I can feel my heartbeat throughout my body. Sometimes it feels very tight in my neck and I can feel vibrations (or heartbeats) in several parts of my body. My head often feels heavy. Often times I'm manually breathing (aware that I'm breathing and have to control it). This is very uncomfortable and it's limited me to just resting in my bed as I would often feel these vibrations get stronger if I try to do anything (like playing games or trying to study). 
So I got myself checked: tested negative for COVID, did some blood tests, everything returned normal. They did a chest X-ray and ECG, nothing out of ordinary. They did a urine test, nothing there too. And now basically the doctors are set in pinning this as anxiety. I've been prescribed some Seroquel (50mg) to have before going to sleep as I would often wake up with the shivers. 
I'm not sure what to do now. I thought things would get better with time but the symptoms aren't going away. Sure it doesn't look like I'm dying rn but what should I do. Visit to the doctor seems unfruitful because all he's saying is it's anxiety. Somehow I feel I'm not being properly treated. Even still how do I go back to normal?? Is this my new reality??? I've never had something like this before. I generally lived a very active lifestyle. I don't drink or smoke or do drugs. Why is this happening and what should I do??
My parents aren't around and I have literally no guidance. It feels like the medical system is betraying me.",1,8,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/h0nivc/ontario_22m_sick_for_over_a_month_i_have_internal/"")",2020-06-10 16:51:00,Physician Responded

Duration of complaint 8 days Location: UK

I was wondering if anyone could help me out with maybe some ideas of what could possibly be going on with me at the moment. 

For over a week now I've been waking up with a very bloated, solid stomach as I eat during the day this is only getting more bloated. I have a feeling of needing to urinate constantly - going to the bathroom up to four times in 15 minutes but no always urinating much once there. 

On top of this, I've been feeling excessively tired &amp; oversleeping. I am usually an early-riser and very active however I simply do not have the energy.

I'm quite concerned and any searches I do with these symptoms bring up a lot of potential causes. It might be worth including this information. I had threadworms about 6 weeks ago so I took 100mg of Mebendazole upon discovery then took another course 2 weeks later and I will be taking it again tomorrow. Not sure if this could be related?

h0oko6,My body rejects most IV liquids,"First of all, sorry for the English.

I (33M, 5'4"", 150 lbs, Asian) got hospitalized for 5 days now and diagnosed with Typhoid and Dengue Fever. For the first 3 days, the nurses only inject me with normal IV saline but they start to inject other solutions via IV, like antibiotics and so on. I noticed that I never have problems with normal IV saline but my body will reject all other solutions. Normally I would spit out all the solutions less than 5 minutes after it's injected, which is a very strange thing to me. The solutions were injected in my hand but how come my body would collect all the solutions in a very short time. I first noticed this when the nurses inject a yellowish solutions, and what I spit out is yellow also. Then I check if the solutions is clear, what I spit out will also be clear solutions. I also only spit out liquids, and can't taste the acidity so my guess is the solutions never goes to my stomach.

-On allergy meds
For several years I have always had this terrible invasive sensation whenever I get hot, emotionally upset, or do exercises. Last night I went out to walk my dog and it was humid but LITTERALY as soon as I start walking outside I get this prickly itching feeling that usually starts at my head/face (eyebrows), neck, and then back/ armpits. It's EXTREMELY annoying and uncomfortable and I can't focus on doing anything but scratching. It's like sporadic random spots on my body (mainly in those areas) that seem to pop up all over and it's impossible to not itch. It gets better when I return to a cooler temperature. I can't even stay in hot tubs long due to this, as the heat causes my head to itch followed by my back and chest usually.  

Despite my skin being a slightly darker completion, I do not notice any rashes whatsoever on any part of my body.

h0otqj,Probably scaphoid fracture - how urgent is treatment?,"Age: 34

Sex: M

Height: 6'1""

Weight: 185 lbs

Race: White

Duration of complaint: 10 days

Location (Geographic and on body): USA/ wrist

Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): None (fall from bicycle caused injury)

Current medications (if any): None

I had a mountain bike crash on May 31st.  I went into urgent care to get an x-ray.  Doctor said I broke my radius and possibly my scaphoid (both non-displaced), gave me a soft splint and told me to follow up with an orthopedic specialist.  Later the report from the radiologist came in, with conflicting information - said the only potential break is the scaphoid.  The report says there is a small area of lucency in the midbody region that may represent a nondisplaced fracture, also this correlates with area of the swelling and snuffbox sign.  I made an appointment with an ortho for next wednesday (6/17).  

I've been reading online that scaphoid breaks require immediate fixation due to the poor blood supply, otherwise union can be greatly delayed or even prevented outright.  My main question - Is there reason to try to get into a specialist sooner than the 17th? (17 days after injury).  If I could get in on Friday the 12th or Monday the 15th rather than waiting until the 17th, would it be worth doing, or am I splitting hairs at this point?  I am wearing the splint full time, in the meantime.  My motivations are getting back on the bike as soon as possible, and of course also having the best long term outcome.  Knowing it may take a while, being delayed in healing by a few days isn't going to bother me, but if somehow delaying treatment by a few days equals a delay in healing of months (hypothetically), I'd want to hop on that asap.  Just having a little anxiety here over the lack of answers.

h0otxk,Spots in vision; possibly nerve damage?,"23 y.o. male

Around a year and a half ago I developed these stationary dark spots in my peripheral vision, in both eyes.  They're not dark as in like pitch black, sorta grayish but just dark enough to be noticeably darker than my surroundings, unless I'm in a dark room or it's at night.  The things is they're not really noticeable when I'm looking still and straight ahead, they kinda only become apparent through contrast when moving my head or eyes.  Here's a representation of very roughly what they look like and where they appear in my field of vision, if it helps: [https://imgur.com/a/NuqlA5f](https://imgur.com/a/NuqlA5f)

Went to my regular optometrist (I'm quite nearsighted and also have slight astigmatism, if it matters) to ask him about it and I don't know if I was just explaining it to him poorly but he seemed to think they were just eye floaters, which I feel like they're clearly not.  I have floaters as well and these dark spots seem completely different.

Does this sound like anything in particular?  I tried to look some stuff up on my own and the only thing I saw that seemed like it would maybe cause an effect like this is optic nerve damage.  At any rate, is it something I should try and see a doctor about?

* Sex: M
* Height: 5'8
* Weight: 185

Meds: prednisone 5mg (for RA), doxycycline

Long story short: in December my female partner developed an odor and slight burning while peeing. I devoloped urethritis (burning urethra, smelly discharge). I went to an urgent care where a urine test ruled out gonorrhea and chlamydia. I was diagnosed with Non-gonnococal Urethritis (NGU) and the doc prescribed Doxycycline for me and Flagyl for my partner. On day 3 or 4 of the flagyl a tampon came out of my partner, which was likely there for about 2 weeks. Likely the culprit of the BV in the first place. 


Fast forward to last week. She has no odor but I have symptoms of NGU coming back (burning urethra, a fishy smelling discharge if squeezed out). A NP at my primary's office prescribed me doxycycline for my symptoms. My gf called her doctor and told them she had slightly burning pee, didn't tell them about the possible BV in December and they prescribe her Cipro on an assumed UTI.  I tell my gf my concerns, she calls her doctor back today and tells them more details and they prescribe her fluconazole. 

My concern: neither Cipro nor fluconazole will treat what may be a silent BV infection in my partner. I've read BV can come back on it's own. Therfore I'm concerned that when I finish my doxycycline and we resume sex if she's not cured then I may just get urethritis again.

h0p7t0,Friend [33F] has concerns about levetiracetam-induced psychosis,"Hey, so my friend has epilepsy which is attributed to two lesions in her frontal lobes (one on each side, same spot, different size). This friend is 33, female, mexican, about 5'3 and 124 lbs. She is a current smoker. It is worth noting there are no neurologists where we are.

Prior to identification of the lesions she was misdiagnosed as schizophrenic.

She has been taking clonazepam, magnesium valproate, and carbamazepine. It's worth noting that the clonazepam and mg valproate she has been taking for years and the carbamazepine for 6 months or so. It seems to work and she feels generally good taking this.

She got stranded in Vanuatu with the Covid circus and had to fly out to new Caledonia to get a new prescription. In New Cal the doctors re-assessed her and decided to replace carbamazepine with levetiracetam.

She is concerned about the levetiracetam as there are a couple of case studies on NCBI about the link between levetiracetam and psychosis. If you google ""probable psychosis caused by levetiracetam"" you will find a couple of paper. I am unable to find numbers around how many people are prescribed levetiracetam so it's hard to guess any incidence rate but it does seem fairly isolated.

h0rqxm,Hives? Dust mites? Allergies? Help!!!,"Age: 33 | Sex: F |Weight: 160 | Height: 5'6"" |Race: Caucasain

Over the past 1.5-2 months I've broken out in what I would describe as hives. They occur sporadically on my body (some on my legs, thighs, arms, hands, fingers, feet, neck); they are reddish in color; they are almost perfectly round and the size of a dime; they are slightly raised up and the skin is hard to the touch. They itch terribly. (I have photos; not sure how to attach them/upload &amp;amp; link)

Initially I thought they were hives due to stress, but they persisted past my stressful work period. We recently bought a home. It was previously smoked in so I thought the hives may be an allergic reaction to the 3rd-hand smoke. Recently the walls were treated/primed and repainted. HVAC unit and vents cleaned. Went on vacation and left the house for 4-5 days; hives continue to come. No major changes to diet; no changes in soap/laundry detergent. New mattress in 2018.

Recently moved from CA to the midwest (12/2018), but grew up in the midwest and already went through one spring/pollen season already with no hives. Never had allergies at any point in my life. 

My husband has not gotten any hives. My daughter has 3-4 once (a few weeks ago), but that is it. I've taken Benadryl 1x/day with no change. We all eat the same foods, use the same detergent, sleep in the same bed (daughter co-slept for a bit).

My questions are: Are these hives? Or are they dust mite allergies? What else could it be?",1,6,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/h0rqxm/hives_dust_mites_allergies_help/"")",2020-06-10 21:08:42,Physician Responded

I was digging irrigation 2 months ago on a rainy day while wearing gloves and I assumed these were just friction blisters.

The larger bump was very small and appeared to be a small blister. The smaller bump never grew in size. As of today both bumps haven’t increased in size. It is round and somewhat smooth but I can’t tell with my callused fingers. It also doesn’t hurt to touch. I never had warts or any previous skin conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m having trouble identifying whether these are blisters or warts. The black dot in the larger bump seems to be a popped blood vessel from pinching earlier today.

h0scyn,Frontal sinusitis? Graves eye Disease? Or something else?,"17M 5'10""

So I've been having a slight ache and pressure around both of my eyeballs for about 5 days now. It's not like a headache because its mostly in the front of my forehead and around my eyeballs. The research I've done seems to all point to the fact that its frontal sinusitis, which would make sense because my symptoms have gotten slightly better over the days, but I don't really have any congestion or the other symptoms of sinusitis. This leads me to believe it might be Graves eye disease because I have had episodes of increased heart rate and anxiety/insomnia over the past 5-6 months, although I don't have those symptoms anymore.

h0set7,"Red splotch on arm, could it be cellulitus?","Hello! First time on this sub, I'm glad it exists!

I am a 21 year old male, 5'6, 160 lbs. Good health.

So let me start by saying I am an IV drug user. I know, I should stop, I could kill myself, could suffer from complications. I get it. Please spare me the lecture. I just started an outpatient rehab program and I am going to meetings now that they are once again available in my area.

Anyway, I was shooting up about 2 days ago and when doing so, I thought the needle was in my vain but after I injected, the injection site became painful and swollen. This is when I realized I missed the vain.

Anyway, I've missed before. I swabbed with an alcohol pad and put a warm compress on it like I have always done when this happens. I was kind of worried though, because this miss in particular hurt really bad and got very swollen very quick.

I went to bed, and my whole arm hurt. Could barely move it, and the site was red and tender still. I drew a circle on my arm around the injection site to see if it got any larger.

The swelling went down quite a bit, and the pain is pretty much gone unless I touch the exact spot, but the redness spread quite a bit. It is only slightly swollen now, but as mentioned the redness spread way down from the crook of my arm where it started.

I know this isn't an abscess because I have had one. Im not sure what it is, but i believe it to be cellulitus. What do the docs of this sub think?; I scheduled an appointment with my doc but it's not til Monday.

If anyone wants a picture, PM me and I will send one. It doesn't look crazy or nasty or anything. Just a very large red splotch.

If you're going to comment on this post to judge me, please don't comment at all. I understand what I am doing is very very bad. I am an addict. I am getting help. I haven't used in two (almost 3) days now. I start rehab tomorrow.

Thanks in advance for any advice!!

h0slyq,[40/M] Tender lump in scrotum above right testicle,"40/M 6’1” 370 lbs

Over the weekend I was doing some light landscaping and the day after I noticed a pain in my groin area I couldn’t identify. The more I’ve investigated it, it feels like a small (?) lump above but not attached to my right testicle that is mildly tender to the touch and noticeable when I walk, stand and sit. It’s firm but not hard. Scrotum doesn’t feel warm or anything. I initially thought maybe I had pulled a groin or something but this feels more like a swelling, a growth or a cyst. I felt the minor pain all of a sudden and since then the feeling has been there in the background but not unlivable.

Lately I have been dealing with some constipation with my Lexapro (and also poor diet currently because of coronavirus anxiety) and I had thought maybe the feeling I had was perhaps pinched nerves but this feels more like a swollen growth or cyst than something with nerves. I’ve had very mild sexual difficulty which I attributed to the Lexapro but not sure if it’s related. I can orgasm but it takes just a bit longer than “normal.” No other big symptoms like blood in urine or stool. Tylenol helps a little. Can’t take NSAIDs because of my heart related meds. In the few days since I first noticed it on Sunday it hasn’t been quite as sensitive but it’s definitely still there.  

Also of note: had a vasectomy in December 2015. Just added background info. 

I’m hoping it’s not something bad (I can be a bad hypochondriac) and I also really hope it’s not something I need general surgery for because I’m super terrified of that after my last surgery.

h0sppw,Zoloft impacting libido? [19F],"Hi,
I’m a 19 year old female. I’ve been on Zoloft for most of my teens (starting when I was 14) for anxiety, OCD, and anorexia. I also happen to have a very low sex drive, which I always assumed to be coincidental—I’ve always figured that I’m just somewhere on the asexual spectrum, that’s who I am. However, in talking with my current partner recently, he pointed out that there could be a correlation between the two. Just doing a quick Google search, it *does* seem like a low libido is a commonly reported symptom of SSRIs.
My question is, do I have any other options? Obviously I would want to talk to a doctor in person before changing anything, but just looking for preliminary opinions. Could being on an SSRI throughout almost the entirety of puberty have permanently affected my sex drive, or is this something I might be able to improve by switching to another medication? Are there even any other medications that function similarly to Zoloft but without this particular effect being common? I’m a little nervous about the idea of modifying my medications, especially since I’ve been on Zoloft for quite a while now, but it would really be great if this is something that could be ameliorated.",6,9,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/h0sppw/zoloft_impacting_libido_19f/"")",2020-06-10 22:16:18,Physician Responded

h0wpfe,8 year old getting hives from water,"Age: 8
Sex: Female
Height/weight is average
Duration of complaint: two weeks
Existing medical issues: a severe allergy to pollen and an allergy to apples
This is in NJ.

My niece has suddenly started getting hives on the back of her neck when she showers or plays in the sprinkler. They’re not crazy bad and go away within about 30 minutes but they do itch and obviously it seems concerning that she’s suddenly getting these hives. 

They haven’t changed shampoo or detergent. My sister put her hair up yesterday and applied water to the back of her neck - she still got the hives. So it’s nothing to do with her hair sitting on the back of her neck. 

She is allergic to apples and that developed suddenly. She ate them all the time then one day when she was six, she got hives while eating them and she was tested and found to have an allergy. And pollen, if she touches anything with pollen then touches another part of her body... hives. She rubbed her eye once and it was awful.

h0xieg,Melatonin extra side effects?,"20F, normal weight, 5’6, depression, no smoking, occasional light drinking. 

So I’ve always had trouble sleeping. It usually takes me an hour and a half to fall asleep, and that’s if I’m tired. If I’m just not feeling sleepy when I lay down it can take three hours to fall asleep. 

Well I bought these Melatonin gummies cause I read that they help people with sleeping. So I’ve tried them a few times now on days where I’m not feeling tired and I’ve noticed that on those nights I wake up midway in the night in a sweat. Not extreme sweat but enough that I end up turning my pillow around. 

I know headache is a side effect but the melatonin makes me wake up extremely earlier than usual (4-5am rather than my usual 9-10) which is fine and makes me productive and all, but I wake up with this incredibly bad headache and I can’t fall asleep to sleep it off. I don’t feel dizzy really, but I just feel sort of blurry. Like when you wake up and you’re half asleep, I feel like that for hours after getting up. 

So this ends with me just taking headache medicine in the mornings. What I’m asking is, is my body just not used to the supplement yet? Is this happening because I’m taking it every few days instead of daily? Or should I stop taking it and find something different to help me sleep?

EDIT: I take the recommended two gummies on these nights and I take them 30 mins before bed as the bottle instructs",3,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/h0xieg/melatonin_extra_side_effects/"")",2020-06-11 04:26:38,Physician Responded

h0y0ov,35F looking for answers about my spleen,"TLDR: Can multiple accessory spleens/splenules be falsely identified on a CT w/ contrast?

Last year I received a radiology report after an abdominal CT scan w/ contrast stating that I have 2 or 3 congenital accessory spleens and no further recommendations re: said baby spleens.

But the thing is I had my gallbladder removed in 2012 (multiple pre-op images were done bc at first a radiologist misidentified my gallstones as kidney stones, plus a follow up CT scan a good month after that surgery) and there is zero mention of any congenital splenules / accessory spleens in any reports from that time.

FWIW I had the surgery at a really good hospital in NYC by one of the top GI surgeons in Manhattan and I’m obviously not a doctor, but I’m 99.9% sure he or his team would have ID’d these so-called congenital splenules. Not only were they beyond meticulous with everything, but I was dealing with major GI issues and abdominal pain both before the surgery and during recovery, so even things like an incidentally found ovarian cyst were discussed and followed up on at the time...but NADA baby spleens were ever found.

Every report from 2012 says SPLEEN: unremarkable or normal in size etc.

And no, unfortunately the radiologist did not have the 2012 prior imaging for comparison at the time of his report last year. I moved from NY to the Deep South in 2016 (2/10 cannot recommend) and my new doctor apparently did not put the old radiology CD or reports in my chart, or the radiologist didn’t bother looking for them, who knows.

So docs, did I somehow grow new “congenital” accessory spleens over the course of 7 years? Or is it possible that the findings from my 2019 CT are not splenules at all and are something else? If so, what could even be mistaken for an accessory spleen? Please share any and all insights and thank you so much in advance.

ETA: I’m new here and not sure if this should be a stand alone thread or a discussion comment in here so please let me if it should be moved. Thanks again.

Hi. I have pretty bad anxiety and last night i was stressed about not being able to fall asleep. And so, I thought about how when i get stressed I breathe manually. Cue manual breathing. After an hour or so i fell asleep. I wake up, think “ah, i’m breathing automatically!” and BAM. of course it triggers manual breathing. It’s been like 3 hours, and I just can’t stop. on top of that i’m lightheaded and it’s hard to walk around because my head hurts.
yay.
any tips? whenever i distract myself and start breathing automatically i realize i am doing so and begin breathing manually. i’d rather this not be a “rest of my life” sort of thing where i have to breathe manually for hours on end every time i think about it :)

update:
it’s been a day or two since i originally posted this, and here’s where i’m at.
I’ve come to this point where every time i notice i’m breathing automatically, i begin breathing manually. it’s the most annoying when i’m trying to sleep. i started taking this theanine multi vitamin type thing at night, and it knocks me out pretty fast. i have woken up in the middle of the night a few times only to stay up for another 20 minutes because i notice my breathing, but i fall asleep after that. it is pretty annoying that it happens constantly during the day though. it’s probably because i worry about having to focus on breathing to the point where i actually do. i’ve found ways to distract myself but it’s harder in the middle of the night. playing and instrument or a game (like a rhythm game) that requires a lot of focus helps distract me. thank everyone for all the tips! my biggest concern at the moment is how long this is going to last. when i breathe manually i always feel out of breath, and my chest hurts. of course, this doesn’t happen when i breathe automatically.

h0zq9g,Should I get screw fixation for my scaphiod fracture or should I wait?,"I am a 19 year old male, have no smoking or drinking habits. I am 186cm and weigh around 70 kg.

Last yesr december I fractured my scaphiod. Tge fracture was small and was healing slowly. It has been 6 months and the pain was still there, but it always got slightly less. Last week I took another ct scan and the doc told me it has become smaller, but recommended a surgery.

My issues could be devided into two main issues.

Issue one: I get into a lot of physical activities and I am scared that it will limit my options. Kickboxing or mountain climbing are two examples.

Issue two: it has slowly healed so far, how do I know for sure it won't heal completely? The doc said that it has healed quite a bit, so why not wait and see. 



I also have some smaller issues

Like I personally don't like the idea of a screw in my hand

Also my wallet will take a blow. 




I don't really trust the docs around my area, it isn't the first they have made misjudgement.

h107hx,28M circular rashes multiplying,"Hello, I’m a 28 year old male, I haven’t been to any doctor at this point but am starting to get progressively worried about this issue. I noticed a red circular rash under my left breast area about 3-4 weeks ago. My GF was diagnosed with ringworm about 2 weeks prior to that, was given Nystatin and the ringworm was cleared within about 2-4 days. When I noticed the red rash we both sort of figured she had given it to me at some point, even though it didn’t look exactly like ringworm, there was no ring, it was just circular and red. It was at this same time I realized that there was another rash near my abdomen area that was also circular but didn’t look exactly the same. It was more of a red ring with a skin tone middle (ie looked more like ringworm). I have been treating with Nystatin because again I figured, oh she must have given it to me and it’ll clear up soon. These two have gotten *marginally* better. The one near my chest has basically faded, the one near my abdomen looks mostly the same though. Then this morning I noticed a third, similar looking rash on my left side, above waistline/lower back area.

she recommended me to go to a general surgeon but my appointment isn’t for a few weeks.

h11tv2,Questions about a few BG and A1C results,"Hey all,

I'm a trans woman (21) on hormone therapy, so I've been getting fairly regular blood tests. Before I came out and started hormones, I was very depressed and eating fast food with soda on a daily basis for a good few months.

Since then, my diet has improved a lot. I still eat fast food every once and a while as a treat but it's much less. Maybe once a week or so.

My first test back in March (right after that couple month binge) had a fasting BG of 102 which freaked me out because that was creeping into prediabetes. At the 3 month mark on June 9th it was 89. I feel better, but it seems like the high end of normal, so I'm concerned about risk and if I need to make lifestyle changes.

I went and got an A1C on Wednesday that turned out to be 5.2, another high end normal result. How should I interpret these 3 tests? Neither my grandparents or parents have diabetes (or aren't diagnosed) and I'm terrified of it. I'm super young and feel like I shouldn't have this high of a result.

I'd like to not be super strict with myself if I still have a good opportunity of enjoying good food while I'm young, but also just staying active/eating healthy every chance I get.

Should I be worried/making changes?

The research I've done seems to all point to the fact that its frontal sinusitis, which would make sense because my symptoms have gotten slightly better over the days, but I don't really have any congestion or the other symptoms of sinusitis.

h12v2s,28M two lumps on the bottom of my penis (NSFW pic),"Hi,

I've tried a desensitizing spray last night, and used a condom while masturbation with a male stroker. I've used the same spray before, and it was ok. Some time later I realized that the bottom of the condom was too tight, that it was cutting the blood flow a little bit. I didn't felt this due to the desensitizer. the spray burned my skin a little bit too. When I took the condom out, I saw two spots on where my shaft ends, and above the testicles. It's right under the bottom ring of the condom. It felt dry and rough at first, due to the erection, but this morning they look like lumps, with the exact color of a blood cloth, but soft.

It must be either the desensitizer irritated the skin, or something related to to the condom partially cutting the blood flow. It doesn't hurt really, but there is irritation, and a subtle burning if I touch them. It looks like a skin discoloration due to the spray, but I'm worried if I should see a doctor.

h13p9w,Strange skin condition,"Hello,

I, 18M, have had this ongoing problem for about a few months now and although it isn't (seemingly) anything threatening or concerning, it is extremely discomforting and consistent.

This happens only on my upper body but is limited to, from the back of my head to going no further than my triceps. 
The closest way to describe what it feels like is an itching sensation, although I'd like to clarify it is definitely not itching. It's a sort of mild burning/stinging feeling that comes in ""spots"" (not in a visual sense but rather I feel it in bits of my body like I'm being stung by bees or something similar). 
**It happens when my body heats up.** 
If I am cold or have just taken a shower then it does not happen. The only exception to this is if I'm watching a show and something extremely intense happens (perhaps my elevated heart rate and or thrill have something to do with it).

The only change that has occured since this has started is I do not do nearly as much physical activity as I used to due to lockdown. I am at home all day and rarely do anything beneficial for my health.

I have no health conditions and prior to this have never experienced anything like this.

Side note: I do not think this is valuable to say, but, whenever I pray I have this same problem.

h14qst,33M - What happens to a pea stuck in the lung in possible aspiration?,"33M

Last week, I inhaled a pea while eating. I coughed hard for about an hour, but did not feel it come up. Other times I've inhaled a grain of rice, but those times I did feel and see it come up. Not this time. It was late so I went to sleep.

The next morning, still concerned about it, I felt like my breathing was uneven. Felt like I could feel the pea in my right lung. So I went to the Emergency Room. I described the event to the doctor and she said that it made sense that the feeling was in my right lung since the path to the right lung was straighter than the path to the left lung. It was more likely for the pea to end up in the right lung in a possible aspiration.

The doctors listened to my breathing and then ordered a chest X-ray and CT Scan. Both showed no foreign body. I told the doctor that sometimes when I took a deep breath, I could hear/feel a sort of wheezing sound coming from my right lung. Doctor said the feeling should go away after a while and to come back if I develop any other symptoms like a fever in case of pneumonia. I was referred to a pulmonologist and ENT if I wanted.

I'm breathing fine now, but am concerned about the pea being possibly stuck in there. Since vegetables, like a pea, are **radiolucent** it wouldn't show up on X-rays anyway. While CT Scans are more detailed, they still use X-rays so I don't think a pea would show up either.

**Question:** Hypothetically, if I don't develop an infection or pneumonia, but the pea is somehow still stuck in my lung, what would happen to it? Would it eventually breakdown and be absorbed? Or would it just stay there until it potentially blocks an airway and then I would have to have it removed?",400,79,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/h14qst/33m_what_happens_to_a_pea_stuck_in_the_lung_in/"")",2020-06-11 11:18:46,Physician Responded
h14x4f,35 weeks pregnant worried about my baby’s growth! [28F],"

I’m 28F currently 35 weeks and 4 days pregnant and I’m concerned that my baby may not be growing properly. Today I had an ultrasound growth scan with the following measurements on the growth chart.  
The Sonographers said that the baby is on the smaller side and looks normal but when considering the individual measurements I feel concerned.

Femur length: 6.38cm which is in the lower 2.4% percentile 

AC: 30.36 which is in the lower 25.3%

My understanding that the head circumference was reflective of brain growth which is what I’m mainly worried about. 

Is it worth raising this further with the maternity team? I’m in the UK so my care is midwife lead. My midwife is actually retired but has been called back to service due to Covid-19, and is suggesting that i don’t have anything to worry about, but I feel like the numbers state otherwise.

h15usb,How do I get medical professionals to stop (presumably) treating me like an addict?,"I'm not sure where to ask this, but I would really like some help as it has been weighing on me a lot lately and I feel like I'm always doing something wrong whenever I meet with a doctor. If this isn't the right sub, let me know and I'll delete it.

I'm 23 and female, \~270lb pre-quarantine when I last weighed myself, and I take Concerta for my ADHD. I also deal with a lot of pain: back pain (from what a PT told me was a lack of muscle development to support myself due to flexibility), feet pain (from flat feet and having manually corrected my inward pointing toes as a child as told to me by an orthopedic doctor), headaches &amp; migraines (for reasons I can't explain), and uterine pain (from PCOS as diagnosed by my gynocologist, and I am on birth control to regulate my irregular periods &amp; pain). I live in a recreational marijuana state, so I have taken to using it to mitigate the pain myself as prior PCPs ignore my pain complaints. It works fairly well.

My last three doctors have ignored all of my complaints about pain for reasons I can only assume are because they think I am trying to get opiates from them so I can abuse them. I have prefaced my discussions of my pain by saying that I have taken over-the-counter NSAIDS to try to help with the pain but they do nothing. One of my doctors prescribed me a medical dosage of an NSAID but it still did not help. I also mention the only time I have had an opiate painkiller which was after an oral surgery and bring up that even the dosage that they gave me of whatever painkiller did nothing for me, which is also true. I explained this so that my doctors would understand medication dosage levels for me and what I know to work and not, but it seems that ever since I have explained this, anything I bring up is dismissed and wrongly diagnosed.

*Edit: I'm removing a lot of information here because it's not extremely important and is a bit too personal for me to feel comfortable with. And an addition: The point of me mentioning my pain is because this is what started all of this. I don't want opiates, and I never have. I explained to my first PCP that I was experiencing pain and what I had previously done to mitigate it and it's successes. I thought this was good procedure and that I should always notify a medical professional of what my experiences with anything are, so that they would have sufficient information as to how my body interacts with substances. Now it is at the point that I am being questioned about the legitimacy of a prescription I received as a teen for my ADHD. I am asking about how to make it so there isn't an onus on myself to prove that my problems are legitimate.*

I might be blowing it out of proportion but it's demoralizing for me to have to prove that I actually need the drug that is helping me hold my life together.

h15z5q,38M Abnormal EKG after panic attack. LVH and acute pericarditis. ECHO ordered but soonest appt not for 7 days. Is this too long to wait?,"My husband is 38M, Caucasian. Nevada, USA. No major health issues. He had an unprovoked panic attack (rapid breathing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, pallor, cold sweats and clamy skin, carpopedal spasms in both hands), Tuesday night that resulted in EMT visit to our home. Symptoms resided within 20 mins. Vitals were normal so they did not take him to hospital. He has never had a panic attack before but has fainted several times in the past from the sight of blood, giving blood, and from training videos showing graphic injuries. 

We had a follow up appt today with PCP. In addition to a physical exam and ordering various blood work, my husband got an EKG. 

The EKG was abnormal. Print out says: sinus rhythm, probable left ventricular hypertrophy, ST elevation suggests acute pericarditis.

I have no idea as to what has caused it as I have made no dietary, personal care, or detergent changes. I've also tried to soak in epsom salt and cbd solution and while these temporarily reduce redness, no notable changes have occurred.

Note, I am allergic to spider bites (and how one bit me in bed would be a surprise) but this would be the first time I had this kind of reaction (usually just a red welt around the bite and large flat rash). My other suspicion is anxiety (I sometimes also get rashes when stressed but they never looked like this- typically flat- and usually disappear within hours). To clarify, I'm not in pain.

h78lld,High biliruben. Low RBC,"I am a 24 years old male. I just got my blood tested today and found out that my RBC is low while the Bilirubin is high.

In my case, I had Jaundice when I was in 9th grade. So I'm assuming that my liver is weak and is not taking care of the Bilirubin. 

Now this is my own theory and don't know if it's true. My RBC is low because the body does not want any more Bilirubin. To overcome the weakness of my liver the body has adapted itself to survive on lower RBC than the normal range. I don't feel any different than normal and low RBC has not impacted my life in anyway.

h7b1oh,"Vesical tenesmus for years, unsure what cause is","(sorry this is so long, I ***really*** appreciate anyone reading and responding.) Hi everyone, I'm a 24 y/o male, 6'2, 173 pounds. No known medical conditions, no medications. I take a magnesium supplement. One day in September of 2018, I developed this unusual problem. I went to pee and for some reason, I felt like my bladder simply wasn't empty. Nothing wrong with urine, no issues with stream, no pain, no blood, no smell, nothing. No incontinence either, I never leak urine. And it is never sudden and urgent, it is low-grade discomfort. I was in university at the time, starting my senior year. From then on, I've had this issue. However, up until lately, I had a multi-month period relief. There is nothing I can pinpoint that makes it better or worse.

What I've had done: Visited 3 different doctors offices, 2 of whom were urologists. I've had 3 post-void residuals (all clear, bladder emptying normally). 3 urinalyses (one, I believe, included a urine culture. Nothing found). An STD check. A prostate exam. Nothing was off. I asked about IC, but both urologists did not believe I had evidence of that as a.) I don't actually go that much more frequently, when it's active it just feels like mild constant pressure in the bladder area, b.) I have no pain and c.) I am not female. I also never (unless I drink a ton of water immediately before bed) have to wake up in the middle of the night to pee. When active, my symptoms are usually less bad in the morning.

There is very little pattern, but I have noticed it has coincided with certain events:

\- It ALL began in the beginning of my senior year. I had virtually no relief the entire school year.

\-Upon graduating, I went on vacation, this problem was not as pronounced, pretty much gone during my trip.

\- This issue almost always went away when another health concern flared up. I got a minor surgical procedure recently. When it was healing, this urinary problem vanished.

\- I had a lot more relief the last several months. Sometimes, it returned for a few days, but this was always coinciding with an emotional stressing event (relationship trouble, in particular).

\- It returned again recently. I just started a new job. I also had a personal relationship collapse recently.

\- I tried a dose of cyclobenzaprine (muscle relaxant) one day, didn't do much. A dose of klonopin has helped a tiny bit, but I do not have that medication on me, and I've only taken it once.

Does this sound like anxiety? I am definitely a worry-wort and I have a history of tension/muscular related issues in the past (about a year and a half before this started, I had IBS-like symptoms that lasted about 8 months, and then after every single test came back fine (including colonoscopy) they simply vanished).",1,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/h7b1oh/vesical_tenesmus_for_years_unsure_what_cause_is/"")",2020-06-11 18:15:20,Physician Responded

male
145lbs
History of unsolved chronic epididymitis.
Taking ibuprofen daily to treat epididymitis.

Last night something really scary happened to me. I was laying in bed and I was about to adjust my underwear when I realized my left testicle was sitting in a completely wrong position. It was laying horizontally, even angled a but downwards. Obviously testicles usually sit vertically with the epididymis posteriour to the testicle, but my testicle was sitting horizontal with the epididymis superior. It also seemed to be a bit sideways. It was uncomfortable, but not painful. I Have never seen a testicle in that kind of position before. 

I was immediately worried about torsion but obviously I wasn't in intense pain so I decided to hop in a hot bath to loosen everything up. I was hoping allowing the testicle to float would lead to it ending up back in place. This didn't work so I kinda grabbed both testicles in 1 hand, and guided the left one and moved it around until it felt the same as the right one. After this everything was back to normal and my testicle was sitting in its usual verticle position. 

Is this something that happens to testicles? I thought they could only move like that if they twisted.

Is this a sign that I have the bell clapper deformity? Should I be wary of how my testicles are sitting?

h7bju3,Upper Back Muscles Quivering,"Background: 32 year old male, 6'3"", 205lbs, ex-smoker (4.5 years cigarette free). I don't do drugs, save for pot 2-3 times a year, not on any medications, no underlying medical conditions that I'm aware of, other than a deviated septum and my current severe lower back pain which I believe is the result of a herniated disc. If the disc is herniated (I'll find out June 22nd when I have my MRI), I don't think it's relevant, as these muscle quivers/tremors have been happening for a few years now

For the last 3.5-4 years  I've been having this thing, where if I lay down in bed, flat on my  back, within about 15 minutes, all of the muscles in my mid-upper back  and under my arm pits, will start quivering every so slightly. Imagine  if you just hopped out of a shower in the winter without the heat on,  and you started shivering and your muscles are quivering every so  slightly, but incredibly fast. That's what I feel. Those nearly  microscopic muscle contractions will continue happening to me until I  sit up. The moment I sit up, they completely stop. Frequently the  shaking is intense enough that it wakes me up.

This  will also very frequently happen to me if I lay on my right side. It's  not an every time thing like laying on my back, but I'd say it's a 50%  chance. Laying on my left side it hardly ever happens. Maybe once a  month, if that.

I stretch quite  frequently, but it doesn't seem to help. I'm scheduled for an MRI for  some lower back pain which I believe is from a herniated disc, but I  don't think the recent back pain (between my L5 and S1) has anything to  do with the quivering. Any ideas what could be causing this, ONLY when  laying down? I've been going to a doctor for it for a little over a year, and he seems to think it's tightness, as well as another doctor I saw in the practice. They both recommended I try a bit of yoga, but it hasn't really taken care of the issue. They're not entirely positive what's causing it, and me not being a doctor, I have no idea.

Post:   
I had a slight tongue tie which I got surgery for last December. My speech was affected by this a bit, and I was self conscious of how I pronounced things. Admittedly, my boss at work made me feel worse about this- I suppose I took this more seriously that I should have. 

Anyway, I elected to get the 'frenectomy' operation done.   
The doctor basically 'clipped' the frenulum under my tongue a little so it has a bit more freedom of movement. After recovery, I noticed a spot on the front half of my tongue which felt slightly harder than the rest of my tongue. It feels like a small lump.   
I went back to see my doctor, who insisted it was a non-issue and also insisted he did not see nor could he feel any lump on my tongue. I felt crazy at the moment, but now, a half a year later, I still feel that spot.

h7byez,Potential UTI-- nervous to go to doctor,"\[18F\] So, I'm not doctor but I think I'm showing the symptoms of an uti. I have a constant urge to pee, had some burning and it kinda aches down there? (like not on the inside, but the outside) I've also been having some excess discharge. I've had extremely mild, what I think were UTI's before that resolved themselves on their own. Though, I've never got one diagnosed by a doctor so I may just be worrying too much. If it is a UTI, it's more serious than any other one's I've had, but it's still in it's early stages. 

The thing is, during quarantine my mother REFUSES to let me go out. The only time I've gone out is to get some mail. This is because my older brother has a very poor immune system and has ended up in the ICU several times due to the flu. My mother is scared that I might contract covid, bring it home &amp; infect my brother. 

And no, staying with someone else is not an option for me. 

If this really is a UTI, I don't want to take my chances and have things get worse. I don't think my mother will allow me to go to a doctor, but she may be willing to go pick up some meds for me.

h7c3i7,26F: Effects of COVID-19 in people with a solitary kidney,"Hi all,

I've searched for this numerous places, and haven't had much luck. Hoping for some luck here! At age 9, my chronic unilateral obstructive uropathy was discovered (after literally years of tests and pain). During surgery to remove the blockage, my kidney ruptured, and I've lived problem free with only my trusty left kidney for 17 years (as of yesterday). As a doctoral student about to enter my final year of coursework, as well as being an adjunct instructor at three universities, I'm in the midst of lots of contingency planning and syllabi drafting for multiple teaching scenarios beginning in August. With new studies showing that COVID can affect/damage the kidneys, I've been worried that this puts me in the high risk category. I asked my nephrologist, and the resources that he directed me to for my answer were extremely inconclusive. Hence why I'm here! If I am technically classified in this category, then I am eligible for special teaching provisions in the upcoming semester. 

Tl;dr...Would an otherwise healthy person living with a solitary kidney be considered a high risk individual during the COVID pandemic?

h7ca1s,"My (20F) good ankle has a massive rash, and the veins are engorged and it’s painful to walk on it and very itchy. Started noticing this after a bug bite.","I (20F) have a history of being allergic to mosquito bites. When I get bitten by a mosquito for the most part they’re about 1-2 inches in diameter, but sometimes they get to about as big as my fist or sometimes my whole lower leg swells up. And when they get large they leave massive bruises and get really hot and painful and I’ll sometimes get rashes on my hands or arms. I also have a bad ankle. I’ve seen multiple doctors for it but nobody can figure out what’s wrong with it. It’s constantly bruised and occasionally it decides to act up and swells and gets so painful I can’t even walk. So that’s just my backstory.

About a week ago I went on a walk and I noticed that I got a bug bite on my good ankle. I didn’t see the bug but I assumed it was a mosquito bite. However, it didn’t really progress the way my mosquito bites usually do. It swelled up much faster and was a lot itchier. But the next day I noticed that the vein on my ankle had kinda puffed up and stood out, which is not usual. And the part of my foot right below the ankle bone was kinda purple. But I didn’t really think too much of it because I’m kinda used to weird mosquito bites and weird ankle things. But anyway, this weird thing on my ankle didn’t get better. It got worse. And tonight I was really looking at it and it’s really red and rashy. Like to the point where there’s a little blood and noticeable bumps. And all the veins on my ankle and on my foot below my ankle are really pronounced and stand out. And it’s been super itchy and it hurts too. Like my whole ankle is insanely irritated. Should I worry about it? Does it just come down to it being a bit of an unusual mosquito bite reaction in a bad spot?

h7d52v,An internal suture from a minor surgery is now.....external.,"TL/DR at the bottom

I (20F) had a ganglion cyst removed from my wrist joint last Wednesday. Simple procedure, recovery has been going quite well until today. My surgeon closed the incision with internal sutures and used a glue-type something on the outside covering it.

Basically super glued me up and called it a day. 

Over the last few days, the extra glue substance that was on surrounding skin/far away from the incision has been flaking off/peeling up with showering and contact with clothing. I was cleared for work, use of the wrist was back to 75% normal. 

Enter the TIFU. I spent some time beside my apartment pool in the sun this afternoon, so I wrapped the wrist with some gauze over the closed incision and a loose bandage over it to keep chlorine/sunscreen/sun away from the area. I was very distracted when I removed the wrapping after several hours, and didn't notice that a small section of the glue substance had stuck to the gauze. It was apparently covering a very small puncture (I thought it was an IV mark or something), and was actually stuck to a long internal suture. 

I had no sensation, no pain, didn't notice that moving the gauze off of my arm was pulling a 1 1/2 INCH LONG bit of fishing line-esque thread OUT OF MY SKIN. What the heck body, warn me next time.

I panicked, made sure nothing was loose or sticking, gently wrapped it back up and am now terrified to use my arm.

I will be calling my surgeons office in the morning, but doctor of reddit, please reassure me that my arm isn't going to split open because I pulled the one thread keeping it closed........

h7dstw,Recreational enemas: how do I avoid being your next embarrassing ER story?,"(Throwaway account for hopefully obvious reasons)

While exploring my very kinky side, I have discovered that enemas are like, WAY up there as something I enjoy. I really, really want to continue doing them, but I want to be risk aware and minimize safety issues so that I don't end up on a gurney because I had a seizure due to hyponatremia.

What I *think* I know:

\- Use proper equipment (got a silicone set up that I can sterilize, has well designed valve to help manage the flow rate, know to keep the bag only a bit higher than the rectum, don't put it up five feet)

\- I know a lot more about the shape and twists and turns of the colon than I did a month ago

What I would like to know:

\- A number of large BDSM forums have said that there isn't actually any hard evidence that regular enema use will result in a dependence due to weakening the muscles (or whatever the reasoning is) - is this accurate? If regular use can be harmful, is there any baseline for how much is too much?

\- Tap water enemas, hyperhydrosis and hyponatremia: what are the risks here? Can this be avoided by making a salt water solution? If so, what is the the approximate salt:water ratio? (I've heard 1 tablespoon per litre - close?)

\- Bowel perforations: ignoring the possibility of jabbing a hole in your intestines with a nozzle (it won't be happening) I've read that there's a possibility the intestines can perforate from the pressure of being filled with too much water - or possibly due to peristalsis, water being blocked in place due to fecal matter, etc. Is this true?

\- I don't intend to ever use a Fleet enema, and most of the uh, interesting liquids are not up my alley. I see castile soap enemas (approximately 1 tsp soap per litre) are quite popular, but could this be immediately harmful for the intestinal lining?

\- Is there any other major risk that I have missed?

If she doesn’t do something to the level of expectations she sets for herself, she goes from a social bunny to lone wolf.

When covid (began around March 10) I started having some pain in my right Leg. Burning and aching when sitting laying etc. walking made it feel better but not for long. 

I lost some nights of sleep over it with having to just pace around my house to make the pain stop. A lot of uncomfort more then pain but there were definitely moments I had pain that was a 10. I took Tylenol to try to relieve pain but it didn’t help. Then it kinda just stopped. Around beginning of April it began again and I knew something was wrong. So I did a telemedicine with my provider and she referred me to ortho. I saw the dr and he said 3 option MRI, PT, or just let it heal on its own and see if it goes away. After a couple weeks I decided  to get the mri as I was doing home excersizes and it didn’t seem to help. 

This brings me here where I got my results today. Looking to see some doctors perspective on what all this means in a non doctor tone- I just don’t understand doctor talk. Could someone dumb this down for me? 

Last week I got an mri for my lower back (MR Lumbar)  and got the results. I have my follow up on Monday and am having trouble waiting to figure out what this stuff means. Can someone give me some clarity? Feeling really gitty to just understand it a bit more before Monday. 


FINDINGS: 
There is a transitional lumbosacral vertebral body which will be designated as L5 for the purposes of this report. Close attention to numbering should paid if surgical intervention is contemplated.

T12-L4 grossly unremarkable

L4-5 shows a right paracentral disc extrusion compressing the right L5 nerve in the lateral recess.

L5-S1 shows mild transitional features of the L5 vertebra with hypoplastic facet joints. There is a broad transverse process on the right that articulates with the upper sacrum and upper iliac bone. The spinal canal foramina are patent.

IMPRESSION:

1. Transitional lumbosacral vertebral body designated as L5 for the purposes of this report. Close attention to numbering should paid to numbering if intervention is contemplated.

2. Right paracentral disc extrusion at L4-5 compressing the right L5 nerve in the lateral recess.

h7gmf7,Increasingly frequent olfactory hallucinations and memory loss; should I be worried?,"(20F, 115lbs, Hx: SLE Lupus and POTS/dysautonomia) For about 18 months, I have been randomly smelling a burnt sulfur-like stench that no one else around me is able to smell. At first it was fairly faint, typically only lasted for less than a minute, and occurred maybe once or twice a week. However, now the smell has been nauseatingly strong lately and lasts for anywhere between 1-5 hours. I have smelled it at home, in stores, at work, in my car, and at friends’ houses; and it appears and disappears very suddenly so I suspect that it’s an olfactory hallucination/phantosmia (thanks, google).

Not sure if this is relevant or could be related, but I have also had both long- and short-term memory issues as well as dysautonomia for several years, both of which my doctor suspects are caused by Lupus affecting different areas of my brain. 

Cancer runs on my mother’s side of the family (which makes me slightly more afraid of a brain tumor), and my job puts me at a much higher risk of exposure to diseases than most people. Any ideas of what could possibly be causing my phantosmia?

h7gmpq,"[M20] My vision is constantly ""moving and shaky"" and I don't know what to do anymore. Please help me.","20 years old male, 178 cm (5""10' foots), 83kg. Non smoker, Non drinker. I took psychedelics some times but i don't think it's related (the last one i took was more than 4 months ago and last time i took lsd was a year and a half ago so i don't really think it's hppv). Blood pressure is ok, my hearth is ok. I'm very out of shape but i don't have any condition or diseases. I am getting a lot of stress from my University tho.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok here is the thing. About the last 2 weeks i've been seeing incredibly bad and weird. It's very hard to describe because it's something i've never seen before and searching online for eyesight problems it seems like it's not something common since i didn't see a single photo that show what i see.

I CAN'T SEE CORRECTLY. I have good eyesight like i can read everything you want but I cannot look at something for more than a second before it becomes blur. Like to see something ""clearly"" I should be constantly spinning or at least moving, if i stay still whatever it is that i'm focusing (an object, a face or a freaking word in a book) is watchable, but it feels like it's vibrating and even if it's all the same color i see pieces of my eyesight that see like a different light quantity or at least i see different graduation of the same color even if there isn't any. Reading one page a book became extremely tiring. Don't know if it's related but I'm starting to have headaches after a few hours i wake up and even if the pain intensity tend to change over time (can get better or worse in a matter of half an hour) but I keep having at least some part of the headache.

If i stay still and look at a specific object (like if i want to focus on it) I see like my head start moving BUT I AM NOT. I am sitting down still but I feel my head spinning and i see even worse. I even have important college exams to take but you know if i can't read a book without feeling sick there is not much i can do. I think my mental capabilities are not infected, but sometimes i do have problems creating complex thoughts or phrases and I feel like i'm being really slow, but that might just be that I'm extremely tired most of the time.

I went to the ER 2 nights ago, they did a CAT scan on me and found nothing, the neurologist spoke to me with a tone like she didn't believe me (yeah, because i would go to a freaking ER at 10PM because i like prank...), the day after made me go to an oculist where he told me i have perfect eyesight even if i told him that during the test it got even worse. He literally told me nothing, no tips not understanding no nothing. Just said to take some integrators the neurologist gave me for the headaches (which aren't working) and hope that ""when the head gets better your eyes gets better"" and meanwhile i have to keep going on this visual torture that it's starting to get less sustainable every day.

I swear i'm actually starting to think that putting two pencils inside my eyes until they get to my brain is a better idea than having to pass another day like this. knowing that not much will really change and the 3 doctors i just saw did nothing to help me.",2,7,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/h7gmpq/m20_my_vision_is_constantly_moving_and_shaky_and/"")",2020-06-12 01:06:46,Physician Responded

h7isap,"[41F] Altruistic kidney donor, ""6-month"" lab results off the charts (details in the text)","6 month check-up is about 2 months late due to covid.  Transplant coordinator set up the labs and then said she'd call me to schedule my in-person checkup when she returned from vacation on 6/22.  Lab work as follows:

Albumin, random urine w/creatinine: 13 (desired result 20-275)

Creatinine: 1.2 (desired result 0.50-1.10)

eGFR: 56 (non African-American)

Urine protein, total, random w/o creatinine: &lt;4 (desired result 5-24)

That's everything.  

Question:  since my transplant coordinator is on vacation until 6/22, no one will actually see these results until then.  Should I be doing any of the following:  Panicking? Calling the transplant coordinator's office to see if someone else can look at my labs?  Calling my primary doc to let her know something is up (My primary and the donor center are not in the same hospital system and she won't get the results automatically)?

The size of the bump on my piercing gets bigger and smaller depending on how infected it is-- it is perpetually infected I think, as it has been swelling and leaking on and off since I got it. However, initially my piercer told me to use the LITFA method (basically don't clean the piercing, bc the shower will do it for you) to heal it and said that my piercing is surgical grade metal. Yesterday, after not having been very infected recently, it got super swollen and released some pus and a bit of blood upon putting pressure on the piercing. I don't know what to do, but this bump is so ugly. My mother put a ton of hydrogen peroxide on it yesterday (despite my having read not to) because it was so inflamed and hot to the touch, so I don't know if that will help the healing process.

h7kud8,Inexplicable fluid in abdomen,"I'm sitting here with my wife turning to the internet to see if there is someone out there who might know something.  Let me start with saying that she has given my permission to post and ask for advice and is sitting next to me as we speak.

Here is the down and dirty.  Female, 35 years old, 5'5"", 116 lbs after last paracentesis, fluid is accumulating in her abdomen and we don't know where it is coming from.  She has had a 5 paracenteses performed with the most recent one being today where they removed 2.2 liters of fluid.  The others have ranged anywhere from 800 milliliters up to 4 liters.  She is currently taking 200 mg progestin with the idea of the cause possibly being endometriosis.  She has been taking it for about 3 months and it doesn't seem to be helping.  Blood has been tested...no cancer markers, nothing wrong with the liver, hormones seem to be fine.  We have been dealing with this for roughly 4-5 years and trying to find an answer with no help from any doctor we have talked to.

A little more background...born premature and had necrotizing enterocolitis a few weeks after birth resulting in a bowl perforation and some portion of the colon removed to fix it.  Everything seemed fine until roughly 2011 where she went in for a laparoscopy to see if she had endometriosis and see if they could see anything that might be causing fluid accumulation (this was around the time they first noticed the fluid in smaller amounts).  Long story short, they botched the laparoscopy...couldn't get in with the camera and injured her bowls which resulted in peritonitis.  2013 they took a sample of the fluid and claimed it was just normal cell fluid.  Fast forward to 2017, we start to see an extended abdomen and large amounts of fluid retention.  First paracentesis is in 2018 and they removed roughly 1 liter.  Next one is a year and half years later and they removed 4 liters. Four months later they removed 900 mililiters and five months later (the one today) was 2.2 liters. (Forgive me if my timeline is off but its pretty close). 

The fluid is a dark brown/reddish color.  It's not thick or turbid.  (think a browner tinted red wine).  Anyway, we have seen OB, GYN, Liver specialists/Hepatologists, General Surgeons, Cardiologists, General Practitioners,  Oncologists (even ovarian cancer specialists)...the list goes on in both Germany and the United States.

We have no idea what is causing this fluid to build up and it is starting to wear down all aspects of our lives.  She is in pain with no energy.  Doctors can't figure it out and with the amount of internal scarring in her abdomen, they aren't comfortable doing any surgery to find out (neither is she or I for that matter).  Ultimately, we are just hoping that someone might have seen or heard of a case like this and would have some information to offer since we can't seem to make any headway with it.

Also, I would like to apologize for the long post and I will be available to answer any other questions you might have.  Feel free to private message me or just drop a comment.

Could the elevated results be from a single beer like 20hours before the test? Or could it be the roaccutane? Are these numbers bad enough thay my dermatologist will take me off roaccutane?

Height: 6 foot 2

Weight: roughly 190-200 pounds

Race: white

No medication or existing conditions, occasionally smoke weed

A few months ago I noticed a weird knot/lump at the bottom of my back, it was just above where my crack started and was not painful just felt really weird. 
About a week ago it started to be a bit painful to touch but otherwise it was fine untill the last few days, it has gradually been getting worse and worse to the point now where it hurts to sit, lay down, stand up and move around.

 It is hot to touch and has spread a bit making a lot of the skin very tough and the slightest bit of pressure caused intense pain. 

I sit down on my computer chair a lot as I do a lot of gaming and work on there but I also do walk around and occasionally go for a run, however no where near as much as I used to though due to lockdown. 

Any advice or help is appreciated as this has become extremely problematic and is causing me lots of pain, and I can't simply go to the doctors due to lockdown being in place.

h7lkaf,Whiteheads/Boils? on top of groin,"Male, 30, Caucasian, 120kg, 182cm, ginger hair/fair skin. I don't drink, I don't smoke.

Hi all, disgusting topic I'm sorry. I'm developing whiteheads and perhaps boils at the top of my groin.

Pictures: [http://imgur.com/a/WlsZ81O](http://imgur.com/a/WlsZ81O)

In real life they look redder and more plentiful than that.

I've had this for a long time I feel, maybe more than 6 months. I also have similar symptoms on the insides of my thighs. I'm a ginger, white pale guy, with sensitive skin, and at the moment I have been in a desert country for over a year (near the equator).

I haven't shaved that area for a long time. I trim it once every month, but never completely shave.

I understand that it's due to my weight and perhaps moisture. Last week I had 2 very painful boils in that area. I did some googling and bought some anti-fungal spraywhich I've been using once a day on the area in the pictures.

Before the anti-fungal spray, my routine was wash this area, dry this area, and then apply talcum powder.

Now, I wash, dry, apply the spray, wait for the spray to dry, apply talcum powder.

* I change my towel once a week.
* I change underwear every day.
* I sleep naked.
* At the moment I have the AC on all day and try to keep as cool as possible.
* I live alone. Nobody else uses my stuff.
* I am sitting for most of the day. I'm still working/relaxing on my computer during quarantine.

Advice number 1 I'm sure is to lose weight, I'm sure. It's something I have been/am trying desperately to do. Apparently I've lost a bit of weight due to quarantine so hopefully this continues. Is there any immediate advice you can advise also? Perhaps showering twice a day?

I don't get this in any other fat folds (e.g. my belly, under my man boobs).

Even after my current treatment of the anti-fungal spray + everything else, I saw a new small whitehead appear today on my groin.",1,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/h7lkaf/whiteheadsboils_on_top_of_groin/"")",2020-06-12 07:21:35,Physician Responded

h7mhjv,How do address wife’s fears about MRI,"Female; 28 years old; 5’7; 124; duration: 5 months; no meds. 

My wife has been having tinnitus and a feeling of fullness in one of her ears. She says that it’s annoying, but not particularly bothersome. Her Audiogram showed a hearing discrepancy, but really hearing loss. The ENT said that he thought it was nothing but recommended an MRI with and without contrast just to be safe. Now, my wife has decided to put this off because she’s terrified of the contrast agent. She made the mistake of doing some research online about gadolinium and came across all sorts of horror stories. I realize that there are some unknowns with it, but thousands of people get these MRIs every year and don’t have any problems. My wife doesn’t find that persuasive because she’s convinced that she’ll be that .0001 person that has ill effects. Can she just get the MRI without contrast? I’m at a loss about how to convince her just to get it. It doesn’t help that the doctor gave her the choice to get an MRI now or wait until her follow-up appointment in several months since she interrupts that as “see it’s not necessary.”

Stools are very loose, watery and they absolutely stink... No blood visable, however I performed a FOB test and it came back positive. :(

Other symptoms include terrible smelling flatulence, pain and aching in the lower abdomen, bloating, rumbling and bubbling tummy, and weight loss (about 5lbs in 2 days)

 I noticed a fair amount of mucus in my stool. Especially the one I took for the FOB test, the entire ""nugget"" was slimey.

These symptoms go on no matter what I eat or how much I eat. I've had IBS with diarrhoea before but it was nothing like this and never lasted longer than a few days...I'm losing my mind with worry because all my GP says is its IBS and take loperamide. I've finish the course and they made me constipated for a couple of days then the diarrhoea came back with a vengeance.

So I found a new doc and was putting together a list of things to discuss and ... I feel ridiculous. Like I shouldn't bother them with going to talk about more than one or two things. 


Here's my list so far and I just want some feedback I guess.. 

•

•

(Sorry for bad formatting  am on mobile)

•

•



~ Discuss with doc ~

•Frequent (1-2+/wk ) Migraines
    - have tried removing light and sound, sitting in showers,      allergy meds, cool compress, heat compress, caffeine, Tylenol, aspirin. Nothing seems to help 

•Stomach pain after eating

•Nausea before and after food

• Vomiting after eating

•Decreased appetite

• Fatigue, always feeling tired like I don't sleep enough no matter how much/little I sleep

• Heat sick, anything above 75° and I get lightheaded, nauseous, headache, tunnel vision, dizzy, cold sweats

•Peeing A LOT like 2+ an hour almost during the day

• Phentermine /PCOS weight loss options 

• Any suggestions on good dentist in area, have had bad toothache since February

h7onl4,What drug do you think would help?,"25M - Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Depression. Also not full diagnosis, but check significant boxes of OCD, BPD. Yes I have a therapist.

Please be kind, just desperately trying to function so I can put my life back together.

No current prescription, but general doc I was seeing last recommended Cymbalta

Options (what I have and could try):

* Prozac
* Effexor
* Modafinil
* Paroxetine
* Weed
* CBD Oil

At the point where I'm scared to put anything into my body because I already feel so generally bad and unstable.

Now suddenly having a hard time getting through the day, had a suicidal episode the other day except I won't do it because it would just hurt my friends and family too much

mostly just stuck in a very distracted, sort of *obsessively* *anxious* depression. Can't focus on anything except how bad I feel - mostly self hatred and despair at not being able to 'go back in time' to fix the decisions that got me here.

I have no specific diagnoses besides generalized anxiety and clinical depression, but with a number of symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder (not enough to be classified Borderline) &amp; Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (just very OCD thought patterns, not the cleanliness and organized kind)

Yes, I have a therapist, he said I need to get on something, he just doesn't know what and recommended I try psychiatry, though wait times are long and I've had bad experiences with psychiatry in the past

Embarrassing to admit, but core issue seems to be that I just feel so alone... Letting everything out to another person feels better temporarily, but it comes back unless I keep getting reassurance that things are going to be ok and I'm not alone.

Seems like it's mostly an excessive self focus issue. People are around me who love me, it's just that they can't drop everything for me to let out how I'm feeling, just so I can feel better. Especially not every time I slip back into the same feling.

I just want whatever will stop me from this excessive self focus on myself and how ""alone"" I am, ASAP

5'2"", 170 lbs
Currently taking 88 mcg levothyroxine
Diagnosed with Graves' disease and Hashimoto's since December 2018.
Do not smoke cigarettes but do partake of medical marijuana a few times a week, sometimes smoked.

Received thyroid ablation April 2019.  Saw eye doctor June 2019.  At the time, he said could see Munson's sign, but said it was very slight.  We were both hoping the thyroid ablation would fix me up and nothing would progress with my eyes.

A year later (now), I am noticing increased sensitivity to light, more dryness and irritation, my eyes look like they have changed shape, and after taking one picture of my eye (retracting the upper lid and looking down), I am ready to puke looking at the picture I took of my eye because it would fit right in with the pictures of Munson's sign in google images.  Fascinating but gross.

I am working with my endo about the thyroid issues - I am still hyperthyroid at this point and testing 3 weeks ago confirmed graves' antibodies still present.    I get bloodwork again in a month to see where I'm at.  Most current TSH indicates hyperthyroidism still active.

What I want to know is what questions I should be asking my eye doctor, and what treatment options I may be presented with for eye disease.  I am thinking it's likely I have the eye disease and want to be prepared to discuss my options.

I actually did those things when I was younger but never had a routine of drinking or smoking. 46 days ago, my grandmother died after 18 days of being in a hospital (she had an stroke). We actually could expect that, as she was 82 years old. By the way, 16 days ago, a young person - who was one of our far relatives - died. It was a day before my birthday. I'm not really superstitious, but my mom and my aunts talked a lot about her demise in my birthday gathering and it made me fearful. 

I don't know what resulted this fear. For now, I can't visit a therapist. I personally think having to deaths close to each other, one of them young and also the current situation of COVID-19 can be hand-to-hand to make a person afraid of sudden death, or as I say ""being dead before the time"". 

So, this situation of mine, resulted some  uncontrolable amount of anxiety. And as I said, therapists and psychiatrists are not available so I can't go and ask some anti-depressant or similar things to calm myself.

Height: 5'8""  
Weight: 183lbs  
Race: White/Caucasian.   


Primary Complaint: I've started getting random hot flushes to my face. The blotches will appear on my forehead, cheeks, nose, etc and then go away after 5ish minutes or so. I can feel the warmth rise up seemingly out of nowhere. Not sure if this is connected, but I have also started having random red blotches on my skin from even the smallest scratch or abrasion. Sometimes my hands will feel red and tender for a couple of minutes and then it will fade and be normal. I've also been experiencing red blotches that become raised and itchy but, again, this fades quickly if I don't scratch.   


Duration: Approx 1 year since I first noticed   


Meds: I take over the counter 10mg anti-histamine as suggested by my doctor. When I told her of my symptoms she seemed unconcerned and said that it is likely stress/allergies/or dermatitis. The anti-histamine does seem to work, but it doesn't alleviate the symptoms completely. It's just frustrating. I feel like there must be a better way to treat this, as it can be quite glaring when my whole face blotches red while out somewhere.

Currently weaning myself off omeprazole (40 mgs). 

Since going on three medications in November of last year (omeprazole, meloxicam, and dicyclomine, I have been experiencing a crushing sensation in my head/neck when bending over. I've discontinued all but the omeprazole for months, but the sensation persists. I've also started getting erratic and high blood pressure numbers around that same time; it was previously good. I'm awaiting results from a aldosterone blood draw and a 24 hour urine collection for blood pressure. 24-hour blood pressure monitor and kidney ultrasound scheduled. I've also noticed that I can often feel my heartbeat throughout my body at different points throughout the day. Not sure if that's new or just a product of paying too much attention.

My question is this: I recently noticed that when bending over, my pulse is very clearly visible on both the right and left sides of my neck, next to the sternum notch. It seems to go away when standing up. Dr. Google (who is evil) gives me conflicting advice.

I think my first bet would be with chronic venous insufficiency to the extremities being a possibility; but the indication that these patterns occur in addition to recently developed knee pains and slivers of leg aches on another on/off basis and the fact that these happen in the first place lead me to think I may either have a DVT or a PE that might have dislodged into my heart or some sort of other cardiovascular issue or anatomical structure abnormalites within the veins surrounding these areas. If it is either of these things I wouldn't have the opportunity to go to an ER or urgent care center due to my circumstances and the fact that I've also recently started to feel aches in the neck and arm seem to further support the fact I may as well have multiple DVTs lodged between my arms and legs that threaten to give me a stroke, hemorrhage or cardiac arrest - I can only say for myself I hope none of these are true.

h7up6l,"Intracranial hypotension MRI imaging, what to look for besides brain sag?","Hi reddit,
I’ve been on disability for over a year now because I have no educated doctors in my area on this subject. Apparently IIH is a complicated issue. 

I’ll keep it short: 

(Male 30yo 178cm 70kg)
Relevant medical history: sporadic headaches going back 10 years. Car accident in 2016.

Sudden episode of severe one sided facial pain (temple to jaw) lasting 2 hours. After this episode my sight has been blurry and I have a constant headache. This happened 1,5 year ago and I am in pain 24/7 every day of the week and ALWAYS see blurry. Other symptoms are fatigue, brain fog, lower backpain, feeling of water in ear.

I’ve had CTs, MRIs, RX, EEG, ...
I tried all the basic medication like Depakine, topamax, emconcor, ..... 
I’ve been to an eye doctor, ophthalmologist, many neurologists, neurosurgeons, chiropractor and even a therapist. 

The path we are following at the moment is IIH because someone on reddit told me a year ago it matches my symptoms and I went to the doctor with that theory. Problem is that the doctors aren’t educated on that subject, and only look for brain sag in my imaging. 

I also had a lumbar puncture done too which measured 23 cm h2o and was ruled normal. The puncture was performed by a first time student and he had to reinsert the needle more than once so I’m not sure how accurate that number is. 

So my question is: anyone here (maybe a radiologist?) who is educated on IIH and willing to help a fellow redditor out? What I need is evidence to confirm this theory, something in my imaging.

Hello all, I am very concerned about some abdominal pain I've had for about 2 months. During the quarantine I was overeating dinner almost every night, which would lead to cramping and congested feeling in my liver. I eat very healthy, exercise, and am otherwise appear healthy, I was just overconsuming food.  After a month of this stress eating, the pain seemed to lower down to just to the right of my naval, and it stayed there for longer and longer episodes of the day, usually right after eating. It seems to go away during a fasting state, and peaks between 1-8 hours after eating. It's a dull ache, and it usually comes with indigestion, even small, simple meals. It can even trigger with beverages or if I drink too much water. I've lost about 5lbs. and some muscle mass. 

I went to my primary care doctor, who did a CBC, metabolic panel, and urine test. Here are the things that stood out to her: 

Bilirubin: 2.7mg/dL (I have chronically elevated Bilirubin, it has gone from 1.8 to 2.2 to 2.7 now over the last 2 years. The conjugated Bilirubin was 0.3 last time we checked, about a year ago, which lead my doctor to think it was probably genetic.)

White Blood Cells: WBC	4.04 10*3/uL	
Normal Range: 4.3 - 10.0 10*3/uL

Neutrophils	1.66 10*3/uL	
Normal Range: 1.80 - 7.00 10*3/uL

She wanted an ultrasound, and the results were non-remarkable. There was a small amount of debris in my gallbladder but no signs of cholycystitis. The thing that really scared me was the discovery of ""Trace simple free fluid"" in my lower right quadrant, right around the area that the pain has settled. The radiologist told me that ""Some people have that, it'll probably be okay"". Looking this up online, isn't that ascites, which is 75% likely to be cirrhosis and 10% various cancers? I can't find anything saying that is normal, or even anything that there's anything greater than a miniscule chance that it's not completely terrible. 

But ""The liver was normal in size and echotexture. 12.5cm Main portal vein hepatopetal."" my liver enzymes were ""perfect"" according to my doctor. 

This leads my worries to cancer, especially with the lower White Blood Cell count. I was told that I could get a CT scan, but I'm concerned that if it IS cancer, the radiation is just going to make the issue worse? And I'm highly sensitive to all chemicals, and my Mother had a bad allergic reaction to the contrast dye before. 
 
I do have a family history of GI problems, usually idiopathic, all very similar to this. Almost everyone in my family. But I'm very concerned, and I have no idea why the radiologist just hand waived the fluid away, it seems like it could potentially indicate a very big problem.

Hello Reddit,
I just a few minutes ago learned I may have a septate hymen, which is when your hymen has a band of skin breaking it into two. 

I put in a larger sized tampon than usual because my period was really heavy today, and now there’s a little less than an inch out, my septate hymen is getting in the way, and since it’s waterlogged thanks to advice from a doctor that I should soak myself in a bath (probably good advice for someone who’s trying to remove a tampon without problems coming from hymen issues) I can’t push it back in In order to move the band of skin to the side to try and remove it

h7y0cd,(23 F) Changes to Blood Pressure and Heartrate after Uterine Cyst,"Hello! 23F, 164cm, 145lbs, hypothyroidism (taking synthroid 75mcg), asthma, and previous iron deficiency. Currently on day 4 of menstrual cycle. Generally sedentary lifestyle with walking, yoga, and aerobics.

 I'm hoping someone could let me know if I should be concerned about changes to my heartrate and blood pressure after a burst cyst.

Two days ago I experienced faintness, intense abdominal pain and vomiting and went to the ER where I was tested for appendicitis, finally being diagnosed with a burst ovarian cyst on my right ovary from ultrasound imaging and an elevated white blood cell count on my bloodtest results.

Since then I've noticed a marked difference in my heartrate- about 10bpm lower than normal, and slightly lower than normal blood pressure. I do not have a fever, and my abdominal pain has mostly subsided except for some positional soreness.

Typically, depending on my menstrual cycle and stress, my resting heartrate is anywhere from 68bpm to 79bpm, with most of my ranges being in the 70s-90s when sitting, 90s-120s when walking/light activity. (This is measured with a fitbit, which I know is not necessarily reliable.)

My blood pressure, measured in the morning (after about an hour of being awake) with an at-home bp monitor is usually on the low end, around 94/62 - 105/ low sixties.

After my cyst burst, however, my heartrates have been 66-75 sitting, 75-90 when standing and a bit higher with light activity. It dips into the 50s when sleeping. My blood pressure in the morning and at the end of the day is usually between 89/61- 94/62.

My question is, should I be concerned about these changes? Are they related to hormone changes or anemia?  Thanks!",3,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/h7y0cd/23_f_changes_to_blood_pressure_and_heartrate/"")",2020-06-12 18:42:41,Physician Responded

Even though I washed everything and replaced things like eye makeup, the eye became reinfected a few weeks later. Did the antibiotics again. Ever since then, that one eye regularly looks kind of red and irritated, particularly in the inner corner. I bought lubricating drops and started using those whenever it looked red, and it would always look fine again after using them. I started questioning whether I ever actually had pink eye in February or whether it was just irritated by something, since the lubricating drops have been helping. Well I woke up today and could barely open my left eye it was so goopy and crusty- it has to be conjunctivitis again.

h7z1pi,Possible Schizophrenia With My Brother,"The long story.  
He was an average high schooler who was dumped by his gf at around 12th grade and quit school out of shear fear of seeing his X. I left to college and within the four years he started hanging out with the wrong people. Caught him smoking weed at some point. He was being taken care of by my mother during all this time. As i finished college about a year ago, he's gotten progressively worse. To the point where he has these episodes of him screaming about people to leave him alone. He zones out, doesn't know what's going on, his pupils dilate and he starts banging on walls and doors to try to get the people he's imagining to go away. Once he started punching my other brother out of fear for those imaginative people and has this stare of murder in his eyes. Right after he gets calmed down he's right back to normal where he sounds so innocent and like he doesn't have problems. He later remembers what he does and he says he's sorry about what happened with my brother. He's not in control of himself anymore.  


Right now i'm in the process of figuring out medicare or medicaid to help my mom with the financials.   
We sent him to our grandmother in another city about 3 hrs away to see if a change of scenery would help. My grandmother was supposed to help out with getting him medicaid but that was when a shelter in place order happened a week after i dropped him off and understandably she was afraid to go out and do these things. He was given appointments only a few months ago with psychiatrists and he was diagnosed with autism,  schizophrenia, and another one i can't recall. To be clear these were all diagnostics of different psychiatrists so it's hard to believe any of them when they all have different results so my best judgement is that he has all of them.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem now is that his important documents (social, birth cert.) are in another city with our grandma since we forgot to take them as it was a rushed delivery of my brother to come home because my grandmother was breaking down after she could no longer handle him and asked us to take him home. The town we live in doesn't have a lot of options, and i need some guidance now that i have the time to do what i can to help my brother out as this has gotten out of hand and now my family is distraught, afraid to have him in the house, and my mother is breaking down too. I no longer live with them as i moved in with my fiance this early year, but i'm only 10m away.

&amp;#x200B;

My fiance has a semi similar case and she deduces that it could be another form of seizure as one of her brothers was born with schizophrenia and has been taking care of him along with her family so she sees a similarity. Another theory is withdrawals but i don't believe that to be the case as he has stopped smoking weed for a long time but i don't know how long that period has to be for that to be plausible.",1,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/h7z1pi/possible_schizophrenia_with_my_brother/"")",2020-06-12 19:48:01,Physician Responded

The issue is my most recent experience with temporary blindness came about without any caffeine in my system, I was on my pc and all of a sudden like every time before I begin seeing a floating black dot that expands and is covered by very blurry jagged shinny lines around it, this only happens in my left eye and it last about 20 min or so. Once it leaves I feel fine but it’s always followed by a monster of a headache that last around two - three days in the back left part of my head.

h7zh9f,When should one be concerned about memory loss issues &amp; can doctors really do anything? [F25] (not Alzheimer's related),"**Age:** 25

**Sex:** Female

**Height:** 5'4''

**Weight:** 118lbs

**Race:** Caucasian

**Duration of complaint:** Always has been an issue but feels like it's been worsening in the past few years

**Any existing relevant medical issues:** ADHD, early-onset bipolar disorder (age 8)--mania is down to a hypo level, psychosis only happened before I got diagnosed and received treatment; and has happened only twice in the past ~18 years, 3 concussions within the past 5 years if that counts. Recovered from bulimia for 2 years

**Current medications:** Lamictal, Wellbutrin XL, Seroquel, Concerta


**Main Concerns:** Working memory, short term memory, and retention (mostly verbal and written). 


**More detail below**

-----------

It happens often where I'm told something or asked something (in a situation unable to write down) and then I immediately forget it which often results in me repeatedly verifying or being reprimanded over ""ignoring"". It's always been some small things. One example I tend to give is how a few years ago I was asked to do the dishes and I got up to the do the dishes, walked to the kitchen, got a cup of water, then walked back to sit down and read. Then 5 minutes passed and I'd remember and get up to do it then forget. I currently live at home and my family doesn't ask for much. I've managed to sort of have a routine for basic daily tasks but a bunch of small things slip and its frustrating since it usually results in me being yelled at for ""not listening"" or ignoring.

The big thing that got me though was today the dishes weren't run over night because there was room, so my Mom apparently said to me--in person--to put my dishes in the dishwasher since it wasn't run yet. Then she left to go to the chiropractor. All I remembered from her entire time being upstairs was her saying she was going to the chiropractor. She came home and pointed out the dishes and how she said that and I literally had absolutely no recollection of that ever happening. And it's not something she's gaslight me about.

Often times I'd be working on something then something would happen like I needed to fill my water. So I'd go downstairs and fill it. Then something would distract me like a separate task or something mundane--often causing me to waste over an hour on something irrelevant before I realize that I was originally doing something prior.

I feel like it's gotten worse through the years and today it's kinda made me wonder if it's gotten to a point of no return. I do occasionally at times feel like I have ""short circuits"" if that makes sense. Where my brain just goes completely blank. Like dissociation almost but not as a coping mechanism. Sorry. This has gotten long.

I'm wondering if this is something I should be concerned of at this point. Or if there's anything I can do **outside of organizational behaviours**.

h802o4,23F Constant feeling of plugged ear,"Hello. 

For at least the last 6 months or so (but not longer than a year), I’ve had this feeling in my right ear that it needs to “pop”. It affects my hearing slightly, enough to annoy the crap out of me. It feels reminiscent of when you have a change in altitude and you need to release the pressure, but it doesn’t feel completely plugged. Maybe 20-30%. 

It will sometimes “pop” randomly when I’m eating once every few days, but it goes back within about 5 minutes. I’ve cleaned my ear out in case it was wax, so I don’t think that’s the issue. I’ve tried moving my jaw, chewing sticky things, pulling my ear, and nothing works. Some days the hearing loss is slightly worse than other days. 

I want to see a doctor, but I’m on a high deductible plan and I know I would see a primary, get referred to a specialist, take a lot of tests, probably to not find a cure while I’m out at least a thousand dollars.

It wasn’t normal as he was really crying so I put him in the car to go to children’s. On the way he started screaming he couldn’t move his hands or legs and his mouth looked funny. He was also screaming he couldn’t catch his breath. So I pulled a you turn and took him to our nearest hospital 2 minutes away. He couldn’t walk and his fists were clenched and couldn’t open. I started freaking out (in my mind) and grabbed him and carried him across the parking lot. They took him right back and took his blood, did vitals and a glucose test. His glucose was 71 and they gave him apple juice to raise it. He obviously didn’t keep it down and kept puking. While they’re asking me questions he’s laying on the bed screaming he couldn’t breathe and he couldn’t move his hands. The nurse went over and said open your hands and he kept saying he couldn’t. She got rude and said “I know you can open them. Push on me wish your arm”. So he did with his hands closed and he could barely do that. She just kept telling him he could do better. I was real pissed by then tome this was over. They said everything came back fine and sent us home. He was in their miserable vomiting non stop and the only thing they did was give him another zofran. The only thing the doctor did was feel his belly and said see you’re fine it’s soft. While he was hyperventilating he put a mask on him with NO OXYGEN and told him to breathe into it. Well he was scared and took it off and the doctor got posted and said whatever he’s fine you are getting discharged. So we left and I called his Gastro and said we were coming in. They sent us to the Er because by then he was pale and confused. The Er doctor read his labs and said his O2 was low so he was put on IV fluids. That helped a lot and he started to feel better. She also said his keytones were 80&gt; and that’s high too. 

They never gave us a diagnosis or what the hell was going on and why he was having spasms. Just sent us home with more zofran and to follow up.

h80r5u,Unsupportive Family Practitioner...Colon Cancer History,"I wanted to see what other doctors thought about my primary Doc's behavior...

So, my grandmother was suddenly hospitalized in February of this year and we discovered she has stage 3 colon cancer. After that discovery, she reluctantly told us all the women on my mother's side of the family have passed away from colon cancer.  She never let us know because she thought if she didn't address the issue it wouldn't happen. The doctor at the hospital heavily encouraged us, my mother, my sibling, and myself to get DNA testing to see if this cancer was genetic as well as a colonoscopy. I scheduled an appointment with my primary doctor and told her of the recent events. I then asked if we could schedule a colonoscopy and DNA testing with someone.  When I requested that she looked at me like I was insane. I am 27 years old and she told me having a colonoscopy so young and continuing to do so is very dangerous for me. She was extremely against the idea of me having a colonoscopy and discouraged me to do DNA testing considering it is expensive. 

I wanted to reach out to other doctors to see if this  type of response is common and if her reasoning makes sense. I don't feel supported by her and I'm genuinely very concerned for my health and safety as well as my family's. What do think?

Also, to clarify how we didn't know about our family history in regards to colon cancer...

h812ep,"I haven’t been to the doctor in nearly three years when I was told I had high blood pressure. I’ve gotten fat since then, stopped taking any medication ~2 years ago, and my blood pressure is very high. Should I be going to the doctor if I still feel fine?","In May 2017 (at 18 yo), I went to a cardiologist to get an EKG and get by blood pressure taken. I weighed 94 kg at 5’9. Everything was still fine except for my BP. I forgot what my BP was, but I was put on amlodipine. Based on my cardiologist’s recommendation, I also got a home BP monitor. 

From May 2017 - Sept 2017, I followed a very strict diet, jogged everyday, watched my BP, and took my medicine regularly. By the end of September, my weight was down to 87 kg. I forgot my BP at the time, but it was still high such that I needed to continue what I was doing. I had just begun my 1st year in college.

By the end of my freshman year, I stopped exercising and taking my medicine. I kept checking my weight through the summer, but I was embarrassed that I gained back all that I’ve lost (and some more). I also stopped tracking my weight and watching my BP completely by the start of my sophomore year.

Fast forward today: I’m a 21 year old college senior weighing 111 kg at 5’9. I took my BP three times just now: 175/103, 190/100, and 184/93. I’m still not exercising nor taking any medication.  As far as family history goes, I believe my maternal grandmother had complications resulting from high BP; neither my parents nor siblings have high BP. In other words, I’m just lazy and fat. 

I currently don’t feel anything “wrong” with me nor does it hurt anywhere; but I run out of breath easily when I walk more than 1 mile at a time (which I have to do when I’m on campus). Starting tomorrow, I’m gonna exercise and start following a healthy diet again. I haven’t been to the doctor since Sept 2017. I’m afraid and embarrassed to go.

Oh and pressure in the head which is a big one. I have aching and stabbing pain under my ears, “behind” my throat , the roof of my throat , werid problems that occur when turning the head etc. I’ve had to quit my job because I can hardly function in real life. I have a connective tissue disease which the exact type is unknown and the thought of eagles syndome was brought up to explain my issues in many  support groups. Anyway , I pop in the dentist and ask him if he knows eagles syndrome and he says no. I ask him to take a look at the styloids and he’s quite surprised by how thick and long they are. He estimated them to be about 2 inches wide over 4 inches long...  the definition of eagles is over 3cm long. I’m kind of excited because this can be fixed with surgery and I’ll finally have some relief from the misery that was the last year. But I’m worried I may be jumping the gun since he doesn’t know much about it.

My boyfriend and I were having sex last night, neither of us have any STD or STIs.

It wasn’t painful though, it was only painful more towards the end, felt like too much friction. After we’re done I lay there for a little bit and feel myself around as I’m “cleaning up” and I noticed i had a bump on my left labia. It wasn’t really bulging or very distinct in shape, kinda just looked like the lip was super swollen. I felt around a little bit and the lump is soft, and oval shaped. Earlier there was some foreplay involved and I asked him if that bump was there earlier and he said no, so it must’ve swelled up during sex I’d imagine. Anyways, I put some coconut oil on it since my skin felt very raw and just went to bed. I just woke up not too long ago, and gave it another look. It’s not nearly as bad as it was last night, but now the oval lump is less inflamed and actually below my labia, more near the vaginal opening. It’s about the size of a dime except it’s shaped oval, and the shape of it is a lot clearer now than it was last night, but smaller and not as red.

h8b2ym,fainting episodes after skin biopsy?,"20 F 112 lbs 5’8

hi

yesterday i had a mole (not even sure thats the right word, it looked like a red mole at the time) removed for biopsy. they gave me a lidocaine shot and removed it w a scalpel i believe. the mole was on my back in between my shoulder blades but slightly closer to my right side. 

since having it removed, i have had two episodes where ive felt like i was going to faint. once, was last night, i woke up with severe stomach pain and cold sweating and went to the bathroom to lay on the floor. i have stomach issues regularly so i thought this may have been that, and took a dicyclomine pill to soothe my stomach. once that kicked in and i had been sitting on the floor with a cold towel on my head for a while, i felt better and went back to sleep. 

today, i had my mom help me clean the wound from the procedure since its in the middle of my back. she used peroxide and neosporin as the doctor instructed. it felt like soon after the peroxide, i started cold sweating. i felt lightheaded, dizzy, and that thick saliva feeling like im going to pass out. all of the color drained from my face. i sat down as she was finishing putting the bandages on and my hearing suddenly got really muffled so as soon as she finished i laid flat on the floor so i wouldnt fall if i fainted. i felt better after a while of laying and drank half of a large gatorade, but im feeling better now. 

i didn’t feel like it was hurting that bad in general and cleaning it wasn’t really bad either. i cant really see the wound myself because of the location but my mom said it was bleeding quite a bit and much larger area removed than the original mole i had. i’m feeling like maybe it’s just inflamed or something and hitting a nerve in my back? i dont even know if thats possible, im not sure if i should tell my doctor about these episodes or if its just the healing, but im not sure i can deal with this every time it has to be cleaned. 

for context, i dont take the dicyclomine regularly, only when my stomach is really hurting. im not dx’d for my stomach issues, but ive had colitis on my right side for the past 5 years, they just don’t know why. i also regularly have low blood pressure, 90/58 wouldn’t be abnormal for me. for my bp issues ive just been advised to have electrolytes often and stay hydrated but they summed that up to “being tall and thin”. usually, when i have an issue with my bp it’s not as sudden as this was unless i got up too quickly, which wasn’t the case in both of these episodes so im not sure that was the cause, but could still be related. i also have a nuvaring for birth control.

h8c78p,30F can you re break a scaphoid?,"Can you re fracture a scaphoid?

Hi all,

I am female, 30, about 65kgs, 160cm. 

I fell badly last year onto my wrist after a step ladder I was on collapsed, had an X-ray and was diagnosed with a fracture of the waist of my scaphoid - you could see it in the X-ray at the time and was a clear line through. I was put in a soft cast for two weeks, then a hard cast after. I then had a CT scan 4 weeks after that, which was inconclusive so they removed the cast and sent me on my way. 

Since I have on cold and damp days suffered with aching and swelling of that area, and the reason why I am asking today is:

Yesterday I did a fair amount of heavy lifting of bulky household furniture, and as the evening came my wrist really ached, and when I woke up this morning I couldn’t bend my thumb or grip. It’s felt like it was when it was fractured last year and is very painful. 

Is it possible to re break a fracture just by doing heavy lifting? Should I get it X-Rayed again?

h8cvuj,"Have been having headaches for 3 years, need help","I am 17, highschool senior and back in my first few weeks of highschool back in late 2017 I started having headaches everyday, these headaches would be moderate in pain, they would not hurt in a special place in the head, it would shift from time to time, they were long lasting and hindered me from studying, paying attention at school,... So I checked if I needed glasses or something, maybe it was eye strain, I did not need them. I did an MRI to check for brain tumours and the result was that I had a ""large cavum septi pellucidi e vergae although without hidrocefaly and remains of ethmoid-maxillary sinusitis."" So I did not have a brain tumor thank god so the next thing to check as anxiety. I had a long history with anxiety since an early age and took as a kid natural anxiolitic which name I can´t recall at the moment. When I started middle school I think (5th grade) I started having headaches, but not as near as those that would appear 5 years later. Fast forward 5 years after the MRI and I got to a therapist for my issues with anxiety. She told me to take a small ammount of Clobazam everyday before school and at night before sleeping. It worked, they kind of went away, the rest of the year was fine, 11th grade as well, still had a few headaches here and there but would not take medicine, I stopped taking medicine on my own because I no longer had headaches to deal with and I was taking benzos and I was afraid of getting addicted. 12th grade came and had a few headaches while studying but no big deal but now they are really really bad, so bad I almost throw up, they are painful, there are times during the day they are worse, right now its hurting just a bit on the top but no big deal. A few hours ago it was really bad in the left part of my skull, affecting my hearing, I would hear a very high-pitched sound and the pain was next to the year, first time it happened to me. I take valium before social events for social anxiety and my therapist told me to take it if I had any headaches, does not work, not even with a higher dose that Im accostumed too, around 2,5-5 mg. I do not want to take medicine in order to study well and pay attention obviously. Is this anxiety or could be something else other than it? The pain is mostly moderate sometimes very painful that makes me dizzy and wanting to throw up, they feel like something is putting pressure in my skull and they change positions along time.

h8d1al,"1.6 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm supraclavicular node, “presumed reactive” need opinions.","Hello all!

I am a 23 yo F, 5’4” and 175 lbs, health issues include hashimotos and anxiety. Currently taking 125 mg levothyroxine and 10 mg lexapro daily. Some marijuana use. Actively trying to find a counselor for anxiety. 

I have an interesting history regarding my neck. A year ago I had an ultrasound that revealed “extrathyroidal nodules” and they recommended a CT, which showed no nodules, but a lobulated thyroid that showed “normal anatomic variation”, also no lymphadenopathy at that time. 

In March, right after my first HPV immunization I noticed a very small, soft, and moveable lump above my right collarbone, it felt slightly larger than a pea, but smaller than a marble. Emailed doctor, she told me to watch it closely and come in if it got larger or wasn’t gone in 3 weeks. I want to stress that this node got smaller over the next 6-8 weeks before I received my next vaccine.

Showed my doc at the beginning of May, at this point it felt more similar to a grain of rice. She wasn’t concerned but ordered an ultrasound. I got my 2nd HPV shot, node returned to previous (albeit still small) size. I got the ultrasound 2 days later on the supraclavicular node. 

All the ultrasound reported was that the previous “extrathyroidal nodules” identified by Ultrasound last time were still there but stable in size and favored to be reactive nodes. But they did note the 1.6 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm supraclavicular node and it was “presumed reactive”. No recommendations or details given. 

Of course, I struggle with health anxiety and google has got me absolutely freaked about this node. What I’m understanding though is that anything greater than 0.5 cm in short axis diameter is considered abnormal in this area. Is this correct? Does this mean my node is “borderline”? 

My doctor wants me to follow up on August but does not think it’s lymphoma, nor does she want to do a chest X-ray. She believes it’s reacting to my vaccines given the history of appearance and enlarging/shrinking.

My CBC in March was perfect, no other concerning symptoms besides the fact that my sternum pops all the time but she told me this was normal and probably just the joints that connect my sternum to my ribs. Not usually painful but have had some pain if I strain myself to pop it. 

Anyway, despite the reassuring ultrasound I’m absolutely terrified I have a mass in my chest or that this node means I have other swollen nodes inside my chest. 

Would you expect this node to have continued to get bigger over the last 3 months if it was lymphoma? Does lymphoma typically present with nodes that stay this small? Would you recommend I push for a chest X-ray?

Every 2 weeks or so, I'll get this squeaking noise coming from inside of me randomly. Normally at rest but can be when I'm walking. It's been happening more regularly recently but nothing much has changed in my life.

I thought it was in my ears originally, but hearing it on video has shown it isn't. Sounds like it's coming out of my mouth but deep within me - I can't feel anything contracting.

I have an at home heart rate test kit and my at rest heart rate is about 98, although I've never been hugely fit and not sure if I'm taking it correctly.

I'd go to the doctor but they aren't open properly in my country due to covid except for emergencies or suspected cancer referrals. Should I push for a doc visit? What could this noise be?

( also she is healthy and literally works 4 times a week) 

With that been said, beginning in 2017, she had a CT scan conducted and was initially recalled as the thought they had seen something on the scan; however, upon repeat, all was clear.

 In October of 2019, she then had a mammogram, and a scan done the mammogram was all clear yet in the scan, the radiologist thought they had seen something that looked like the beginning of pneumonia however she had no symptoms or anything so another scan was conducted and all was clear.

Last month she went into the hospital once more, and blood work and the scan were completed. 

The blood work was excellent, and the CT to see her blood veins, I believe, was good; however, now the chest scan was where the radiologist saw the following nodules.

1. Micronodule in superior lobe 8.5mm ( sorry I'm translating this from a French document)
2. micro nodule 5mm in small lobe 
3. the last one is 4mm in the lingual 

The doctor wishes to repeat the CT scan in 3 months, so I believe she will go in August.

( anyhow since the late 90s they have always been detecting something in her lungs however after another scan it is suddenly not seen)

Should we be concerned? I'm terrified at this point.

My stream is very weak and hard to get out and I have to keep coming back every few minutes to get out little bits again. It lasts for hours. It kept up for a few nights. I was hoping it would go away on its own, but I think it's safe to say that it won't. It's also been impossible for me to achieve a full-on erection. Basically, I don't want to go to a urologist only for him to tell me that I'm wasting his time and should have just gone to a PCP doctor and had a UTI test. I also don't want to waste time by going to a PCP and have him tell me that my issue isn't his specialty and I should really have gone to a urologist.

What do I do? I don't know how critical this is. I don't want to delay too much longer and cause myself to have acute kidney failure.

EDIT: Also, my roommate has leftover antibiotics if I should start taking those.

So basically i'm experiencing urinary retention I think.I've also had Post-void dribbling for a long time now

Height: 1.64m.

I don't drink, smoke or use drugs and never have.
I don't take any medication.

When I was like 10 years old I started to have troubles breathing, like if I couldn't breathe in enough air to fill my lungs, it always got worse when I was laying down, I would feel suffocated, and no matter what I did, the feeling of not having enough air didn't seem to go away. My mom took me to the doctor and they told us they didn't see anything wrong, that it was just anxiety and that there was nothing to do. 

I've been living with that since then. Sometimes it's not that bad but it's just something that doesn't go away. It's gotten worse lately. I have to breathe through my mouth every few seconds because my body literally forces me to, yet the feeling never goes away. I feel suffocated, I can't breathe properly and I told my mom and the only response I got was ""it's the anxiety, there's nothing we can do about it"" but I have the feeling it's more than just anxiety.

h8o60r,Heart skipping beats,"Hello. I am a male, 20 years old 6 feet 0 inches and 155 pounds. These last six months or so have been pretty rough for me. In October, my chest/heart felt weird so I went to urgentcare to get  it checked out. Along with having a really high blood pressure (151/95 or something like that) I also had an ekg done where it came up abnormal (think it mentioned something about possible early repolarizarion). I then made an appointment with a cardiologist and between the time of the urgent care visit and that visit I started getting skipped beats in my chest. The first time it was brought on by extreme stress (doing stand up comedy for the first time) but now occurs randomly. At the time, I smoked marijuana relatively frequently, vaped a ton, ate unhealthy, drank coffee a lot, and was sedentary. Fair enough to say that maybe these were the issues lol. My cardiologist recommended stopping all of those things so I did. Nicotine has been completely cut out, caffeine and weed severely reduced, I now live a way more active lifestyle, and also eat healthier. These things seemed to help a lot, as the skipped beats were reduced tenfold. However, in this last week they have come back with a fury, affecting me worse and worse as the day goes on. During the morning and afternoon I feel perfectly fine and can even get some exercise in without feeling shitty, but once like 6-7pm rolls around they start up and continue to get worse until I go to sleep. If I had to guess, a skipped beat will occur maybe one in 20-30 beats when it gets at its worse, but this will go on for a few hours. It’s pretty nerve wracking since I felt that I have completely turned my life around health wise but am still feeling these annoying and scary skipped beats. I have no other symptoms. If anyone could help me out that’d be much appreciated. Thanks!

Edit: also should mention that I’m pretty health anxious

h8x0n0,"[24F] Hair Falling Out in clumps - Abuse, bullying &amp; weight loss. Please help!","I’m 24 F, 158cm, 65kg.
I’m on 300mg Effexor Xr (been on that for years for anxiety, depression and PTSD) and 100mg Topamax (been on over a year to help me with weight loss as I wasn’t able to lose any weight no matter what). 
I have waist long brown, it has been described as my “crowning glory”. I don’t get compliments on my appearance, my hair is the only thing that will get a compliment and now it’s falling out like crazy. 
I have to clean my brush every other day. I’m noticing thin patches around my hair line and feeling the thinness at the back of my head. 
If I gently go through my hair with my hands I can easily retrieve 20 loose strands. 
When I wash my hair it’s a lot worse. I keep having to remove thick clumps off my back (I’ll add a photo of only one of these clumps).
Everything is covered in my hair my clothes the floor, it’s sad and it’s disgusting; it’s also making my mum worry too. 

What might have contributed to my hair falling out:- 
Last year I was horrifically bullied and abused by the board members of a volunteer organisation I volunteered with. These people turned all my friends against me (including a best friend and I don’t know why, but there is no way of contacting her to find out, it kills me), destroyed my work studies and made my life a living hell. 
I have spent the last year and a bit emailing back and forth these people trying to get detail on the some of the things they were doing and why as they were destroying my name and spreading lies. I also spent this time in bed crying, I still do. I am pretty much nocturnal. I sleep as much as I can to get away from living life. I also have lost about 20kg mainly from not eating much. Also creating the documents needed for a lawyer who will look at my case.

So stress, depression, trauma, weight loss. 

What can I do? Apart from fixing the depression and anxiety, which I’m trying to do, is there a shampoo I can use or supplements? I’ve tried silica years ago but found no results from that.

h8x2q4,My sons had a rash for over 3 weeks now (17m),"Male, 17 months old. 

Hi, my son (17 months old) has a rash mainly on his hands and feet (also on his legs and arms) which has been there for over 3 weeks now. He is completely well in himself, no fever, sickness and eating and drinking completely as normal. 

The rash is small colourless lumps with some areas of redness. In the past week this has been accompanied by small darker red speckles which do not disappear under a glass. We went to get some blood tests last week when the new darker rash appeared, and the tests have ruled out anything serious (sepsis, meningitis etc.)

[Here are some pictures of the rash. ](https://imgur.com/a/uVbrjkr)

It really aggravates him at night and he often wakes up scratching his hands and feet together. Over the past 3 weeks we’ve been prescribed hydrocortisone creams, paraffin cream and antihistamines. I’ve spoken to my GP multiple times and have tried a variety of things, but nothing seems to work. The antihistamines seem to calm the itching down for a few hours at night but I think that’s more because they make him drowsy. After a few hours he wakes back up itching and in distress again. 

So far it’s been suggested it could be:

A post-viral rash – he wasn’t unwell before the rash

Hand, foot and mouth – he’s not had a rash anywhere near his mouth, no fever and eating as normal

Eczema – doesn’t blister/scab like eczema, however hydrocortisone hasn’t changed it’s appearance 

Allergic reaction – this was our immediate thought when it first appeared but the fact it’s remained for 3 weeks and not eased by antihistamines makes us think otherwise 

We’re completely stumped at what it could be, whenever we go back to our GP he just suggests it could be one of the conditions described above and if doesn’t get better come back in a week. 

We’re at our wits end and just want to know what it could be. Any help or insight would be great, thank you!",3,9,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/h8x2q4/my_sons_had_a_rash_for_over_3_weeks_now_17m/"")",2020-06-14 09:40:56,Physician Responded

h8x83k,"27M - Weakness in fingers+hands, worst in the morning.","Current problem:
For the last 4 years, but especially so in the last 1-2 years, I’ve noticed a feeling of weakness in my fingers and hands that wasn’t there prior. They feel their weakest for the first hour or so in the morning. I have a noticeable loss of grip strength and trying to open something like a medication bottle (requiring some force) makes my hands feel very fatigued very quickly. It gets better as the day goes on but my hands just haven’t felt the way they used to. When they’re at their worst I can feel and am very aware of every joint in my hand moving. There is some pain as well but it’s primarily just weakness.

Background info that might be relevant:
- I was in a bad rear-ending accident in 2016 that caused whiplash. The weakness started around this point. Stupidly ended up seeing a chiropractor for my recovery from this accident instead of doing PT. Chiro said the weakness was a temporary effect from the accident? Something about blood flow to the nerves being impacted? I’m not entirely sure, but the guy ended up being an anti-vaxxer too so I don’t trust anything he’s said.

- I sleep on my back with my hands on my stomach or chest. Not sure if that makes a difference.

- I have Hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome but it’s fairly mild. No full dislocations and tbh I don’t even know what a dislocation feels like. My EDS presents mainly as gastro symptoms and chronic pain but figured I’d throw it in in case it’s relevant

h8yvtb,Question about a childhood medical experience with a testicle check,"&amp;#x200B;

I apologize for this being kind of long, but I felt like I had to give a full context, and I guess for myself I needed to write it all out. I really appreciate being able to ask for a medical perspective on this while looking back at it though. If possible, I would like a female physician's opinion since I was always most comfortable seeing female physicians and ended up seeing on for this incident. But obviously any medical perspective would be useful in helping me process this a bit more. I am deeply appreciative of anything you would be willing to share, thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

So, in general, I was a somewhat reckless, fearless, and rebellious little kid. But I, unfortunately, am extremely sensitive when it comes to my genitals, specifically my testicles, which have a higher concentration of nerves than most boys it seems. Well, this lead to me being deathly afraid of getting my testicles checked when I was little. Whenever they came up at the doctor's I would find any way possible to avoid getting checked, either not cooperating at all, or active resistance, or just like running out of the office and getting lost in the parking lot until my mom eventually found me after like hours of searching. My mom tried to explain how important testicle checks were, but I never really felt there was anything wrong with mine, just that they were really sensitive, and not something I ever wanted anyone to look at really, but that wouldn't have been that terrible; I actually think I did let a doctor look at them once. But I couldn't imagine the thought of anyone touching them; it seemed like the worst thing imaginable to me. I was a pretty crazy kid and didn't really shy away from pain that much, but falling off skateboards or being tackled constantly in football was like nothing to me in comparison. It wasn't even pain really, but like sensitivity...like having someone poke your eyeballs if they were wrapped in whatever it is that goes off when you hit your funny bone. If I even tried touching them myself I would like spasm from it and be unable to do it. So I put up enough resistance to the idea that my mom didn’t outright make me I imagine because of how difficult I made it, but maybe because she felt sorry for me, though I don't know really. Since it got put off repeatedly to my young mind that meant I could put it off forever, but at one point that changed.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the pivotal points was that I played football at school. Because of that eventually, it came time for the boys to get their sports physicals done. Well, I never imagined that something like a testicle check would be involved in such a setting, so it caught me pretty off guard when at the end of the physical the doctor told me to pull my underwear down. Naturally, I refused, and my mom ended up having to come to the school to try and talk me into it. There was this administrative lady who ended up coming over and she was super upset about the whole ordeal as well for some reason. I remember her asking my mom when the last time I had a testicle check was because maybe they could use my most recent one instead of doing another one. When my mom told her I had never had one before the admin lady sort of exploded and was like “excuse me? Why hasn’t he ever had a testicle check before??”  And my mom sort of just tried to explain she was really sorry about my behavior but I would never get checked because of my sensitivity, and I always ran out of doctors offices so she had never made me get one before. My mom did have me see a counselor/therapist. But unfortunately there was nothing she could do for me, she kept trying to help me mentally, but she couldn't solve the physical sensitivity, so my sessions with her pretty much ended with her telling my mom there wasn't anything else she could really do for me, but I did see her for almost a year prior. There were also a lot of other times I managed to escape doctor's offices when it was brought up. Often I actually was so scared I hid under a car in the large medical parking lots and my mom had to call the police to help find me after a few hours, so...it was pretty bad I guess :/

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the admin lady then pulled my mom aside for a moment saying something about it being really serious and I heard her say something about it being reported, then they tried to talk me into doing it at the school, but I couldn’t imagine possibly getting checked, even though my mom said something like, ""this is your last chance to get this over with right now, this is completely ridiculous. We can go home right now without doing it, but you're going to have to get checked later, and it's going to be much worse..."" but I was so frightened I did the opposite of what she wanted and just agreed to getting checked later, imagining she was bluffing. (Later I would learn about the school contacting CPS about this though because it is a requirement for state physicals for boys).

&amp;#x200B;

So, afterwards, I just wanted to forget the whole ordeal. That worked out ok for about a month or so and then one day my mom took me to this new doctor's office without really telling me what we were going for. Eventually, I became curious while we were waiting, and asked my mom what we were at this doctor for and I asked my mom what we were at this doctor for. My mom decided to be bluntly honest with me and said, "" Doctor Carrigan specializes in dealing with uncooperative, sensitive kids."" I turned pale and couldn't even move...and barely managed to ask something like, ""why are we here though?"" in a daze even though I knew the answer. And my mom told me ""Well, you had so much trouble with the testicle check at school I was advised this would be a better alternative for you. This doctor is better at handling uncooperative boys. And since it’s been years of trying to get you checked, you have to get a testicle check done today.""

 

I wanted to run away very badly, and although I felt frozen, I did sneak over to the door when my mom was talking to the receptionist for a moment, but they had a security guard outside the door who brought me back in. A nurse came out and told my mom it was ok, lots of boys try to run out of the office because they’re nervous about testicle checks.

 

I was extremely freaked out, though. When they called my name I tried to hide under a chair, but they just sent two nurses out and they and my mom managed to pry me loose while I was begging not to go into the exam room to get checked. I think I managed to kick one of the nurses in the face while they were trying to get me to the exam room, so they just carried me into an exam room, and held me on a table, and then before I knew what was even really going on I was basically unable to really move and was strapped down in restraints.

&amp;#x200B;

After a few minutes of my mom sort of angrily telling me to calm down, the doctor came in and she was almost nice given the situation. I was actually kind of glad it was a female doctor as I always asked me mom to go to female doctors, I figured they would be nicer. She said, ""Hello, so you're here for a testicle check today Micah. Are you willing to cooperate today so we can let you out of these straps? Or would you rather stay in them to keep you still?"" Despite being petrified, I could barely pretend I would cooperate, but I did try. And she actually did let me out of the straps and I actually held out some hope maybe I could just be looked at and not touched, so I asked the doctor, “Is there any way you can just look at my testicles and not touch my them?” But she said, “No, I’m sorry…” before she could say much else I tried to run out of the exam room like a lightning bolt driven instinctively and overwhelmed by fear. But a nurse in the hallway instantly grabbed me and another nurse came again and they just took me back in kicking and screaming and strapped me down again, and then exited the room.

 

After the initial fluster, they were letting me calm down a bit, and my mom and the doctor were just chatting, and my mom was like ""Why do you think he hates having his testicles checked so much? He was really ridiculous at the school physical. I just don't understand it."" And the doctor was just kind of casually saying something like, ""Well, it happens, some boys are more shy and sensitive than others and have a harder time cooperating with these checkups than other boys. It's perfectly fine, and normal, that's what we're here for since this is a state requirement for all boys.""

 

She and my mom then approached me, and my mom told me to calm down because ""I’m sorry but the state requires testicle checks as part of boys' standard physicals every three years; the school reported the incident last time, and a social worker spoke to me said you have to get this done. It's not that bad to get your testicles checked, all boys have to get it done."" Which was almost awful in itself...hearing her just calmly, like sweetly say ""Ok, so just try to relax ok. I know you don't like getting your testicles checked, but that's what we're here for today Micah.” And then to my mom she asked, “Can you please undo his pants, and then pull down Micah’s underwear for me mom, so that I can take a look and check him?”

&amp;#x200B;

To my horror, my mom slowly undid my pants and pulled them down while I couldn’t move. I begged her not to pull my underwear down, but she wouldn’t listen, and just slid them down, and then stepped back, but kept watching. The doctor came over and looked at me and then said, “Ok I am going to do the testicle check real quick, ok? I will be really fast, it’s just a minute or two of prodding, and it’s over! You will be fine, I promise.""

 

But I was not fine. I hated the feeling of not being able to move at all, or do anything as I felt her pulling my underwear down. And there was a very long pause before she actually touched me. I was just lying on the exam table, unable to move in front of my mom and the doctor... waiting for the worst thing ever. And it was really intense. I strained against the restraints when she finally touched me and started crying. But at least it did get over with somewhat quickly. Unfortunately, she thought she felt something on one of my testicles and had to go back and feel it again... turned out to be a benign lump. But it was awful hearing her tell me she needed to take one more feel after thinking it was over with, and it wasn’t any easier the second time she touched me.

 

Then she pulled my underwear up, told me that I was healthy, and that she was proud of me while letting me out of the restraints.

 

By that time I definitely regretted not just getting checked at school. But it was obviously way too late for such thoughts.

h8z3dr,Is it possible to have drug-resistant jock itch/tinea infection?,"27M, 184 cm/75 kg, caucasian, living in the Netherlands

Last summer I started feeling itchy in the groin area. That time I was dating someone who had the same issue for a long time and also had toenail fungus. I went to a doc, got diagnosed with a jock itch and prescribed a creme containing miconazole + some steroid. Used for approximately a month. That helped and I also stopped dating that person. Unfortunately, itching returned in a month after that and since then I struggle getting rid of it. It looks like plain red skin in the groin area (not attaching pics because it is NSFW). Gets especially itchy in the nights and after taking a shower.

So far I tried three cremes: 
- miconazole creme (1 month), 
- clotrimazole (1 month), 
- terbinafine creme (two times for one month). 

Nothing helps. Terbinafine helps a little bit in the beginning but does not do much in the end to redness and it still itches (even though a bit less). Miconazole/Clotrimazole did not help at all, contrary they made itching worse.

I discussed these with three GPs. Two of them suggested jock itch and prescribed azoles. The last told it was eczema and suggested steroid. It helped in the short term, but then itching got back.

A couple of days ago I got angular cheilitis. Dry lips and crack in the corner of the mouth. The internet says that it can be also due to fungus. I applied terbinafine creme on it but saw no improvement. 

Will go to my GP because of this but I am afraid it will only suggest me oral terbinafine. I am afraid of its side effects and do not have much hope because its topical version did not help much.

Now, about an hour and a half later, the pain is now near gone but maybe only because I put on an aloe gel with a bit of lidocaine in it.

h90bus,22M Bone or lymph node behind/above ears," 

Hello, I am a 22 year old male hypochondriac who is 6 foot 4, 12 stone, white, non smoker, rare drinker, take sertraline for anxiety. 

I have noticed fairly prominent protrusions behind my ears which extend upwards, this is more easily felt on the right so I guess is slightly asymmetric. This is rock hard as far as I can tell so I hope it is just the shape of the back of my skull, but I cant help worrying that these are hard lymph nodes I am feeling. There is a large protrusion right at the back (I know this one is normal) and multiple other bumps and ridges, some are symmetrical from one side to the other, some are not.

I have been worrying about lymph nodes for a few months now, and have had neck ultrasound and a blood test, which have all returned normal. However, I continue to worry and furthermore, search for other things to worry about. This is the latest thing I have discovered. Should I be concerned?

I have also noticed that my jaw is very slightly off-centre to the left, the jawbone protrudes on the left hand side more so that on the right. I can sort of ""tuck"" my finger behind it more on the left than the right. I assume this asymmetry is also potentially normal, but would be good to hear from someone who actually knows, rather than my anxiety-riddled brain.

h90igh,How to cure athlete’s foot,"32F I’ve had athletes foot in my left foot only for 10-15 years. It began on the bottom of my foot kindof between my two smallest toes. It ‘travels’, slowly of course, it’s been at that corner of my foot a lot, at its worst the skin between the last three toes has been raw and painful, it’s been in all areas on the bottoms of my feet. I first noticed it in my big toenail about two years ago, and in all my toenails maybe 6 months ago. It’s so gross and I’m so tired of it!!!

Doctors have basically blown me off. They say use OTC cream, with the confidence that it’ll clear it up in 6-8 weeks. My primary doctor is the only person who’s taken me seriously, and she said that there’s honestly nothing you can do to get rid of it. She says the creams help as well as general hygiene. She explained that the oral medicine isn’t worth it, the results are mediocre, and it’s extremely detrimental to a fetus, so much that she prefers not to prescribe it to women of childbearing age, because it stays in your system for a couple years.

I regularly see podiatrists for other conditions, I’ve had a few surgeries, my last one was June of last year. I asked the doctor again for what can I do?! At the time my big toe was looking pretty gnarly from about 1/2 way up and to the top. She shrugged he shoulders and said look at all this healthy growth, I’m not worried, toenails take a long time to grow out etc.

Now, a year later, yeah the big toe has continued to grow out healthy, and a few weeks ago, the remaining unhealthy bit got ripped off because it was so thin and weak. My other 4 toenails have become more rigid, flat, brittle, they’ve got the white lines, and some yellowing. Especially my baby toe, it’s turned super yellow and hard and shriveled up. I’m 32, not 92!

It’s 100% just my left foot, I’ve never had an inkling of anything on my right foot. I use either medicated powder or cream OTC medicine every morning before I put my socks on. I shower regularly. I always wear clean socks, even if for some reason I take my socks off mid-day, I put new ones on. I rotate my shoes. I wash my socks in hot water. My husband hasn’t ever caught it from me either.

Here’s some pictures if you’re with me this far: [gross feet](https://imgur.com/a/iO30FqZ)

h90x6k,Ehr interoperability... Patient Perspective,"So recently my dad over 70 years old had found out he had a thoracic aortic aneurysm. It was first discovered when it was really small a few years ago after he was admitted to the hospital. It balloon to about  *8 cm*  in size after a few years after being admitted to another hospital. We then had to have him transported to another hospital because the only doctor in the region possibly state that specialize in it works in that facility. I began being bombarded with information and research about risks and how it may have been prevented if it was managed well. He is older so when he did go to the hospital he didnt advise his primary care doctor hence it slipped through the cracks. It was also the prep in getting the surgery done in terms of getting medical records from one facility printing them and sending them to the different doctors and specialists he had to go to or keep calling for offices to send them over.

So my question after going through this is why isnt there a central way to transfer medical records between facilities and share with patients. Then I found about EHR interoperability.  My question is more so why havent their been a more strategic push of having an easier way to access medical records. Do doctors find it not helpful to have a central place to view a patient medical records. For example log into a database and have all their records across hospitals they been too, other doctors they see, etc, Patients to be able to view their medical records, keep track of medications and appointments, etc, Or is this something only a few people would find beneficial.

This is the first time I’ve ever had my iron checked. It looks like everything is within normal limits, except my % saturation is high. My test result is 46% which, from what I understand, is quite high for a female. I’m concerned about iron overload. 

I was on my period when I had the test done, but I’m not sure if that matters. I also checked my 23andMe results for hereditary hemochromatosis, and it looks like I have one genetic variant (HFE-Related) “detected, not likely at increased risk.”

I’m really not sure what to make of this result. Should I get this retested when I’m not on my period?

h93147,Scared about high blood pressure,"Hello,
I’m a 24F, height is 160cm and weight around 50kg.

I have been dealing with anxiety for a couple months now. I am now almost diagnosed with fibromyalgia and am doing alot better with the anxiety.

However I am still very scared to measure my blood pressure. The last time i measured it was back in April, i remember it being 138 and i freaked out. I repeated it 3 times and it ended up being 132. Was still freaked out. Heart rate was in the 90s.

I had taken my blood pressure a couple times around a week before that elevated reading. It would be around in the 100s and 110s, and also in the 120s a few times.

I have not taken it again ever since. I am watching my salt intake and make sure i walk at least 10 000 steps every single day. I also run for around 30 to 40 minutes around 3-4 times a week. 

My anxiety is alot better but i am still scared to measure my BP and keep fearing i have hypertension without being aware of it. 

I did recent blood works for my chronic pain. Also ordered cholesterols tests and the doctor said everything is normal. All of the rest of blood work came back fine. I also did a couple of EKGs back in February, all fine as well.

Am I blinding myself by not measuring my BP ? Should i stay away from that machine ? I am doing my best to be healthy and avoid stress but this keeps lingering in my mind.. I really do wanna get better.

So I work contracting and construction. After a few days of working up in the attic with insulation and tearing down parts of the sealing, I felt something breach my safety glasses. I washed it off and continued. However, over the past few days the swelling has maintained a constant size. I am not sure if something may have stuck itself inside my eyelid, but I have had a similar occurrence happen not two weeks ago. However, I was able to find the culprit, a piece of string caught inside my bottom eyelid. I have left images of the swelling and a small white dot i can see when I pull back my eyelid. Any ideas and recommendations on what to do?

Hhx: Depression, anxiety, IBS-C, iron deficiency, insomnia
Meds: Venlafaxine 225mg, iron supplement, vitamin C supplement, melatonin 10mg 

On Thursday the 11th i went under general anesthesia for a root canal (severe dental phobia). When they woke me up in the office I was extremely belligerent and was thrashing around and screaming like crazy. When I got home I punched my husband in the face and tore apart our entire apartment in a fit of rage (I am NOT a ragey person). Then I passed out on the ground. Husband called 911. Paramedics brought me to hospital. I got 4 of narcan, no response. Smelling salts not much of a response. Then woke up lated and was belligerent again in the ER, refused to let them do head CT, I was screaming about being raped. I got admitted for observation. I woke up in the middle of the night, went to the bathroom, got dizzy and passed out again. They did head CT and it was normal. The next morning I had paranoid delusions, I was convinced the FBI was monitoring me and they were going to take away my daughter, paranoid the nurses were poisoning me, ect. I ran away from my room and it took them an hour to find me. Then they gave me olanzapine and I slept for like 20 hours straight. Woke up normal with very little memory of what happened. ....so my question is how the hell did general anesthesia do this to me?

I have been under general anesthesia about 5 times in the past for various procedures and this did not happen. I had another dental procedure 3 weeks prior with somewhat similar results. I did a root canal under moderate IV sedation and while I have no memory of it, the dentist told me I was fighting them the entire time, hence why we did general anesthesia for the second root canal. I do not have a history of violence other than during these two root canals. 

These are the meds I was given according to the anesthesiologist: 15mg midazolam PO, Once IV was started, you got 150mcg fentanyl and 20mcg dexmedetomidine titrated,
150mg propofol for induction, You got another 100mg propofol after intubation because you were bucking on the tube, 10mg dexamethasone. Most of these meds between 1:07 to about 1:20. Sevoflurane maintenance until about 2:30 and toward the end I gave you another 25 mcg fentanyl and 15 mcg dexmedetomidine to do awake extubation, Along with 4mg ondansetron

I will need more dental work in the future but both of my experiences with anesthesia for dental treatment has been, well, horrific. Moving forward I'm terrified this will happen again. What could have caused this? What in anesthesia makes people go psychotic?

h9768s,Is there anything to do about blurry vision?,"TLDR: Went to eye doctor, things still blurry. Returned to eye doctor, things still blurry. Normal? Worth going back?

Hello. I went to the optometrist a few weeks ago. 

I got my eyes checked, everything looks great, and I got a new prescription. But even with this new prescription, my vision was still blurry, even with good eye-care hygiene. I went back to the same optometrist, she checked my eyes again, and she gave me two new prescriptions to try, both stronger than the preceding one. She said to wear one or a week, then the other, then choose. 

Well, I've worn both, and my vision is still kind of blurry.

During a lot of normal daily tasks I don't notice it at all, but I have to type documents in size 16 to be able to read it, and I put the internet browser at 120% zoom. I notice it sometimes while reading, as well, or while looking at lights or things that are several yards away.

Once or twice I've blinked and for a moment everything was clear. Then it goes back.

What do you think? If the optometrist could do something to fix it, I'd go back, but I don't want to pay for a useless appointment if she can't do anything. Is it useful to go back?

Would I see better with glasses do you think?

* Five years ago, I suffered a stroke on my RIGHT side due to high lipoproteins (I recovered completely, thank god).
* I have glasses but don't wear them often.

Height: normal kid-like height

Weight: thin kid size

Race: caucasian

Complaint: Right eye is ""bouncing"" and he has no control over it. He says it is only bouncing up and down and not around. He said he couldn't see as well out of that eye and it was hurting. I asked him what it felt like and he said, ""It felt like something was kicking me in the eye."" He had no headache. At first I thought it was a twitch but he was very adamant that it was his eyeball and not his eyelid. 

Duration: This is the first time he's mentioned it and he seems very stressed out. He said it happened for hours before he told us, but it seems to be better now. I'm a little afraid to just wait and see if it happens again since it is super freaking weird. 

It's hard to get any information out of him after the fact as he keeps reverting to dirt bikes and coyotes. During the episode, he was absolutely freaking out and worried and couldn't answer anything because he was all kinds of, ""My eye is BOUNCING!!""

I had a staring contest with him to try to see the bounce but he would eventually close his eyes and rub it, very distressed. We put him in a dark room with no electronics as soon as we checked him out.

For 17 months my vision has been oscillating/shaking/.. everything moves constantly..like vertigo but on a mini scale. loud sounds, talking too loud, feels like someone shook my head. I am almost completely deaf in my left ear for about 20 years after blow to head. It also rings constantly. I've had bppv, this is different. 

The Vng test showed weakness on left side 36% but no nystagmus. I was then sent by the ENT to physical therapy and in for a repositioning for ear crystals. The physical therapist did not do the repositioning because she says I don't have bppv, and never heard of my symptoms. I then contacted the ENT and again went over all of my symptoms and he doesn't have a clue.

 I have been to a neurologist and an eye doctor. My eyes are perfect and I have no tumors or anything that could be causing this.  I've had an MRI with and without contrast and an MRA done. everything looks fine other than some mild sinus problems. 

So the neurologist / ENT says I have Meniere's disease. The problem is I can't find a single person out there that has my shaky vision symptoms. So we did oral steroids, steroid injection in ear, and then to Gentamicin injections in my ear which made me way worse. I won't go into that because at least I know what's causing these new symptoms. yet even after all that my shaky vision still remains. Every second of every day. now supposedly my vestibular nerve in my left ear is completely dead and if that's the case then why do I still have shaky vision. I worry that maybe I was misdiagnosed. Is there any other illness this could possibly be? I have now lost my job of 13 years over this and now filing for disability because the Gentamicin now caused me to have oscillopsia. I have searched every medical site there is out there and patient forums and can't find single person like me. I can't be the only case like this out there. Please some one help me.

h98t84,I think I had my first seizure,"27 year old male, 6'2 about 220lbs, not on any medication.

Hi, first time posting here but am really worried and stressed so im hoping somebody can give me some input on my situation.

I've been having some health problems for a year or 2 now (chronic fatigue and muscle pains, bad heartburn and currently waiting for a ultrasound on my neck for swollen lymph nodes the size of grapes). But 2 days ago im pretty sure I had a seizure. I've been doing some reading to rule out other possibilities and im certain thats what happened. I was a little high off a weed brownie but thats nothing new to me and i have been using edibles for the last 5+ years so I know the feeling. It started off with some minor deja vu ( which im used to it happens sometimes after eating an edible for me) but then I started getting this feeling of ""impending doom"" like a gut feeling something bad was going to happen and like my body was giving me the warning signs to get help. I remember being confused and couldn't stop pacing around. Then my brain started feeling like it was warm and tingling and my arms/ legs were twitching like crazy and I had no control of my fingers. I cant recall how long this went on for but it could have been anywhere from 10-30 minutes and then I think I passed out.  So the last few days after researching it looks like I could have had a partial seizure (potentially triggered by the thc).

My question to all of you is what my next step should be. Should I go to the ER and tell them what happened to get checked out? Is there anything they would be able to do or even tell if it was a seizure I had? Or should I just try and ignore it and hope ot never happens again?

h98yh4,Are we actually asleep during surgery?,"19M, 150lbs, non-smoker/no alcohol

There is a non-insignificant number of studies pointing to the possibility that patients may not actually be “asleep” during surgery. One famous study involved an anesthesiologist condoning off a patients arm during general anesthesia (by tourniquet if I remember correctly). Halfway through the surgery, the surgeon would ask the patient to squeeze his hand if he/she was awake, and if he/she was in pain. More often than not, the patient squeezed. Apparently, it wasn’t a small movement, either, but one large enough to be noticed from across the room.

So, how asleep are we actually during surgery? Is it possible that we feel pain, but quickly forget about it? What do you feel is the moral impact of this?  


&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I bring this up out of curiosity. I was reading some articles online about general anesthesia after waking up during my own surgery. While I wasn’t in pain, I woke flat on my stomach, my eyes taped shut. I couldn’t move, but I could hear people talking and the heart monitor beeping, as well as the sound of the “squeezy things” they wrapped around my legs to prevent clotting.",1,8,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/h98yh4/are_we_actually_asleep_during_surgery/"")",2020-06-14 21:31:10,Physician Responded

h9hnep,Severe Memory loss after taking Hypertension pills.,"Hello everyone, about two weeks ago, my Friend did an anxiety attack. He went to see the doctor which gave him hypertension pills after discovering that his blood pressure was wayyy too high. I do NOT know what is the name of the pills he was taking. My only informations are that it is for hypertension and that he was given 20mg instead of 14mg by mistake. I do not know if it's the doctor's fault of the pharmacists fault. 

My point is. About 4 days ago, he started losing memory. He literally doesnt remember his dad, his mom, his sister or his brother. Dont know their name, their age, nothing. Like they were perfect strangers. They went back to the doctor which said he can stop taking those pills if he wanted to. As a matter of facts, he stopped taking them since Saturday. He doesnt remember me, what we've done in those last years, nothing. He does however remember his name and his face. He havent slept in those last 4 days until this morning at 3am. 

He woke up around 9am, and everything that he did yesterday is completely gone from his memory. He doesnt recognizes his family again. He refuses to talk to anybody, refuses food (he hasnt eaten a single bite in the last 4 days, only drank a bit of water). 

I know internet is not a source. But his parents dont want to trust hospitals after this. I know he should be there, and I'm pushing them to bring him there, but I dont know when they Will be going. I'm literally breaking down to see my friend destroyed like this. We've all tried to make him trust us, but so far it only pushed him away. 

Once again, internet is not a source, but I think the pills he had was something between Benzodiazepines and Beta-Blockers. I just cant seem to find anything that correspond exactly to his needs, which are Hypertension and Anxiety. I saw that Propranolol could cause some sort of Emotional memory loss, but not like Amnesia. 

That is really scary. Please help us get my friend's memory back.",1,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/h9hnep/severe_memory_loss_after_taking_hypertension_pills/"")",2020-06-15 07:40:57,Physician Responded

He felt my groin and confirmed the hernia then laid out the two types of surgery and some statistics. I honestly was a little overwhelmed and nodded a lot and said that which of the two procedures did he recommend

I guess I thought I might have to be MRId or something to even see what's wrong in a more detailed way before he just makes an incision with a general idea of what is wrong. 

He sent me down the hall to his scheduler who scheduled me for less than 2 weeks away, and he left. I said who can I call if I have more questions and the girl said the nurse, and wrote down a number for me. 

Am I wrong to feel like he is making a lot of assumptions?

I applied sunscreen 3 times but apparently didn’t do so great applying evenly on my legs. I was sitting with my legs crossed for a while and my inner calf was exposed to the sun leaving this unpleasantly shaped sunburn. 

The first 2 days my skin was really red and felt like a normal sunburn. I have been applying aloe 2x daily since then. After those first 2 days, there have been no symptoms at all other than this discoloration. It seems to be getting better and lightening up, but extremely slowly.

Hello, I have some red circles around my groin which do not itch or hurt or feel any different to the rest of my skin. 

I first noticed it when I was 14 when I shaved my pubes on a whim and assumed at the time that it was a birthmark, however I don’t have any real memory of noticing it before I developed pubes. (I lost my virginity at 14 but do not know whether I noticed these red circles before or after the fact. Could it be an std?)

Recently however, at 22, it has occurred to me that it is clearly visible without the need to shave which has led to me concluding that it must be getting bigger. 

Does anybody know what it is and whether I should be concerned from a health perspective?

Eventually after multiple doctors appointment, xrays, and MRIs, it was found that I have Grade 1 spondylolisis in my L5-S1 region. But during this process I also noticed I was having trouble flexing my right bicep. I could flex it, but when I did it was hard to maintain and my arm would start shaking immediately. I told this to my doctor and was sent in for an EMG test. The test came back that I may have slight ulnar nerve entrapment in my wrist, but after speaking to the doctors, they don’t believe that would cause symptoms through my entire arm. My back and and neck MRIs also didn’t seem to show anything out of the ordinary, besides the sponylolysis.

Lately I’ve noticed I get the same sensations when trying to flex my leg and calves muscles, but only on my right side. I have an appointment with a neurologist in August but unfortunately I can’t get in sooner and I’m worried my symptoms could get worse or become permanent.

This time, my issue is a slight pain underneath my tongue. Just noticed it today while I was brushing my teeth—AGAIN! After a bit of investigation, I noticed that I had a bit of skin dangling from the underside of my tongue. 

I believe it’s normal to have those veiny bumps under your tongue (at least in my case it has always been like this), but none of them have been long enough to the point where I can grab it with my fingers. 

It’s not excruciating, but there is a slight pain when I move my tongue a certain way or touch it. No burning, no tingling. Is this normal?

Have asked about this a few times here, mostly to no avail so far. I’ve scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist, but it’s a month away and I’m getting a really bad breakout today.

Basically I’ve had what I think are hives since February, when I was really sick with what was probably a virus. (Tested negative for flu and COVID-19.)

The hives are extremely itchy and even painful, and when I get them I get body aches and chills. I usually get them on hands, arms, wrists, legs, ankles, feet, and toes, and when I do those parts of my body usually turn purplish and swell up.

Back in Feb., I saw an urgent care dr. about it who put me on a steroid, which did nothing.

I’ve talked to my dr.; he thinks they’re stress-induced. Stress is certainly a factor, but I also get them when I’m cold or when I’ve drunk caffeine, or for seemingly no reason at all.

They’ve come on nearly every day since February, usually for 10-20 min. bouts. Today, however, I’ve had them since waking up. Just took Benadryl just in case, but that usually doesn’t help.

Any and all help greatly appreciated; I’m working (from home) with lots of pain in my hands right now going along with these things.

I’ll get partial vision loss in my right eye just about once a week. It’s been happening for quite some time now I’m not exactly sure when it started though. Started keep track of occurrences at the start of May.

04 May 5/10 vision loss 14 May 6/10 22 May 7/10 31 May 6/10 04 June 8/10 15 June 8/10

Symptoms are partial vision loss in my right eye, as in weird grey “looking” texture appears covering my vision. It is always on the left side of my eye and will increase in severity over a small time frame of about 5 minutes to cover a large portion of vision. It doesn’t start like bleeding in from the left edge it just starts in the leftish portion of my eye.

I can feel when the vision loss is just starting to happen, but I’m not sure if that is just my brain starting to realize my vision is going funky and trying to compensate or if there is an actual physical pressure I’m feeling in my eye.

My worst case was where I lost almost 90% of vision in my right eye where I could only see a small bit in the right center of my eye (this case was before I started writing them down).

All cases taper off in severity after a peak vision loss and my vision returns to normal after the 5 min period.

habcyl,Eye goes red randomly,"20F, 161cm, 47kg, non smoker/drinker, no medications 

This has been happening on and off for around a year. My eye will suddenly get painful and feel like it really needs rubbing, although I try not to touch it. That sensation comes really quickly and only lasts for a few minutes. Then by the next morning it’s watery and red. It doesn’t really bother me besides how it looks, as it’s quite noticeable in person.

I’ve been using a dry eye spray from a pharmacy and that doesn’t seem to stop it happening. Basically I’m not really sure what to do with it now, or if it is actually dry eyes or not

habr2z,Birth control pills give me migraines w/ aura and I think I'm running out of options (23F)," 

Hi!

I've  been dealing with unbearable migraines for almost 5 years now, caused  by birth control pills and at this point I feel pretty hopeless and  upset.

The first brand of pills  gave me migraines after the 4th pack, and when I had a fibroadenoma in  one of my breast the surgeon who operated on me suggested consulting my  doctor to switch to another pill so we did. I used that pill for almost 2  years, I started having migrains after 1 year. During this 1 year  period I went to a neurologist who couldn't figure out what caused my  migraines, she couldn't find anything unusual, had MRI done, everything  was fine, she gave me some pain killers, that I use when I have head  aches, but somethimes they don't work (this is the 4th pain killer she  prescibed, and it still barely works). After 3 years of taking 2  different type of pills I realised my head ached are caused by the  hormonal pills.

So I consulted my  doctor, who suggested taking a break from them, then a year later (this  January) he prescribe me 3 different pills that all gave me migraines  sooner or later, and now I'm on my 6th brand. So I think it's pretty  clear at this point that my body doesn't tolerate when my hormonal  levels are altered.

My doc sees  these pills as the only proper and reliable source of contraception (I  totally understand why), but I don't wanna live my life with these  unbearable head aches. Ffs I failed exams because I couldn't see due to  the begining of my migraines. And god knows, what if I'm driving and all  of a sudden I'm unable to see because I'll have a migraine and the aura  just gets me from out of nowhere?

I  was thinking maybe I should get a copper IUD but since I have a history  of pyelitis/Pyelonephritis chronica (I don't know what It's called in  English, these are the best translations I could find - basically I had  issues with my  renal pelvis (I hope it's called this way) as a kid for  years) from childhood I'm afraid I'd end up getting them out real quick.

My question is I think:

1. Am I wrong on the copper IUD? (never gave birth)
2. Is there any chance I'll find a brand of pill that will not cause me migraines?
3. If my gynecologist isn't willing to find me another way of contraception should I look for another one?
4. Over all suggestions, that might be helpful?

Thank you so much in advance!",2,7,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/habr2z/birth_control_pills_give_me_migraines_w_aura_and/"")",2020-06-16 13:13:47,Physician Responded

However tonight as fairly often I blink and my vision in my right eye goes all cloudy/gooey like there’s something in it, blink a few times and it clears and then blink again and it comes back, like it’s hard to clear. So I go to the mirror to see if I can see anything and surprisingly see this (thing?) on the surface of my eye, almost looks like a small contact lens.. it would kind of move when I pushed my eye but stayed until I rinsed my eye out. Then I had like goo on my eyelash. Then just returned to the standard blurry vision etc. Also have really really bad dry eyes and awful night vision and light sensitivity in general.

harvya,Full-body exam with dermatologist -- what can I expect and can I decline to be examined in some areas?,"37/f

5'7

255lbs

White

I use an inhaler for my asthma.

I have a few concerning spots on my face. My primary doctor froze one of them off back in February since she felt like it was too concerning to leave it before I could get in with a dermatologist. (It has since grown back.) The dermatologist office kicked my appointment down the road because of COVID, so that's coming up now. 

The lady manning the phones told my husband I should expect a full-body exam. I am very hard of hearing, and he usually comes with me, except for this time they don't allow extra people to come in because of COVID and I don't have anyone to watch the kids anyway, so it'll just be me, which I'm extremely anxious over. I'm also especially worried over a full-body exam. Being a morbidly obese woman, I have some hang-ups there. 

So, my question is -- if I ask for just my face to be examined, since that's where the present problem is, would that be an issue? My husband seems to think so. And if it is full-body, will I be in a gown for part of it or just naked up on the table?

hawn2n,Spot on lung xray - I am freaking tf out.,"So I had to get a chest xray as part of a TB screening (immigration medical). TB test came back negative but they found a spot on my lung. Like an idiot I didn't ask any details, so that's all I know (my mind was reeling at the time)

I just got off the phone with the public health nurse (the one who did my TB tests). She said the doc wants me to get a CT, plus followup xrays every year to track its progress.

I'm trying to rationalise with myself that she didn't stress urgency in getting the CT (I have to wait for my health coverage to kick in before I can get it anyway, plus the wait lists are six months plus). However, I do smoke marijuana (2.5 years) so that's a factor.

On the other hand, cancer is literally my biggest fear, so I can't stop stressing. I'm hoping if it looked iffy on the xray they would have stressed to me to get a CT, or even jumped me ahead in the line? 

I looked up pulmonary nodules, and I'm hoping it's just a benign one of those (someone said they're like moles, but in the lung). I have no breathing difficulty or other symptoms.

Sex: Male

Preexisting conditions : ulcerative proctitus

Hello! I've been experiencing chest pains off and on for a couple months now. Long story short... Freaked out thinking it was heart. Went to ER and had EKG. All good. Went to doc appointment and had EKG and blood test. All good. None of my doctors seem particularly worried when I bring it up. Had short visitation with cardiologist and he basically said he thinks it's muscular or skeletal, not my heart. He said he has many expensive tests he doesn't think I need to do.

So to ask... I do have intestinal issues with gas due to my condition. Is it possible that it is gas causing chest pain? Most of the time I notice pain, and then bubbles in my lower gut and then.. You know. And lately I've been getting burps afterwards. I guess I'm just concerned because it's mostly left to center chest pain and I didn't think gas and/or acid reflux could cause pain that far up or that far left.

A week ago (Thursday June 11th) I went into urgent care because of a very sore throat and swollen white spotted tonsils. I came out positive for mono. They did a strep test too, which was negative. I was prescribed three days 10mg of Pretnisone. 

On Monday, when I had been off the Pretnisone for a day my throat ballooned and I could hardly swallow. I was in constant pain and no pain killers did anything. I can honestly say it was some of the worst pain I’ve ever experienced. I couldn’t sleep for more than 30 minutes at a time. So I went back to urgent care because I was worried. They did another strep test (negative), and gave me 6 more days of Pretnisone with tapering doses. I am currently on day 4 which is 12 mg. They also referred me to the ENT, and I have an appointment there in a week and a half. 

I understand that with mono the swollen tonsils can take weeks and weeks to go away. However, the white spots on mine seem to be getting worse, and on some areas it has turned blackish. It really looks horrible, I’ve never seen anything like it. I talked to a nurse in the ENT office and she said that they will get me in earlier if they have a cancellation but to just keep doing what I’m doing. (Rest, painkillers, fluids, vitamins). I just can’t get over the fact that my tonsils have greenish black spots on them. Will I be okay to wait a week in a half? That sounds so incredibly long to me, as I am still in a lot of pain literally all the time. Is this just what mono is like? I’m not sure urgent care can do anything else for me at this point?

hbimy3,Can Spironolactone influence my blood results?,"Hi, 

I have a question:

So i have Alopecia Androgetica and i just got my medicine, spironolactone 50mg to be exact. But the problem is, i’m experiencing alot of vague problems and i’m 1000% sure it’s something with my thyroid. 

I don’t want to make an appointment with the doctor rn because of corona and maybe taking someone else’s time who has a bigger problem so what if i take my medicine now and then, maybe in a month i make an appointment and they take blood, doesn’t it influence my blood results? 

So the thing is, my doctor doesn’t know im taking spironolactone, they apparently don’t prescribe it here in my country. The only thing they prescribe is minoxidil. Trust me, i tried. 


So my question is: should i take it now or later?

**TL;DR:** How the hell is one supposed to eat 18 mg of iron daily?

Very bad choices led me to gain a lot of weight in my 20s, got to be a max of \~220 lbs by the end of 2018. GP told me I needed to lose weight, so I did. I started eating healthier and exercising more. For the past 4 months I've been eating below 1400 calories on average. I'm still losing weight, but I started to feel very tired in general, and get easily out of breath while exercising. GP send my to take a blood panel 2 months ago. Results came back and he said I was ok but said that since CBC values came considerably lower than the last few times, I needed to eat more iron rich foods. Since I'm already logging the foods with an app that tells me the nutrients, he said I should aim on getting 18 mg of iron daily, and explained all the ways of maxing iron absorption (vitamin C with heme iron, avoid dairy in same meal, etc).

So it's been 6 weeks since I started paying attention to the iron. I use a digital scale, and verified sources (like USDA) to check iron amounts on every food. I still have severe issues trying to reach that daily amount. It seems like the only days I'm able to reach it is when I ether eat beef liver, mussels or a huge amount of spinach. I love spinach, but I don't really enjoy liver or mussels so I have to find ways to have them. Beans, lentils and seeds are good, but I can't have too many since I'm still losing weight. The days I have those with some eggs, I still can't reach 10 mg of iron. 

Past 2 to 3 weeks have been worse, I feel even more fatigued and dizzy than before. I think because of the pandemic measures in my country, my GP's office have stopped answering phones. I left a voice message but haven't hear back from them yet.

So question is..  how do people do it? It seems an insane amount to get daily. 

If it matters, here's my last BP:

Hc: 36%  
Hb: 11.9 g/dL

I think it's important I say that I used to wear glasses, 0.5 in my left and 0.75 in the right. I have been diagnosed with myopia and astigmatism. I used glasses regularly, but had to take them to repair in February; however, due to the lockdown I still haven't gone to pick them up, so since then I haven't used them.

I've been having this particular pain since March if I remember correctly, so I assumed it was because I was too used to wearing glasses and my eyes were just tired. It happens once or twice a month.

It usually starts in both eyes, and by the end it's just the left eye which hurts the most, I can describe it as if something being sort of pulled from behind. I feel it coming from the inside of the superior eyelids, and it goes to the center of my forehead, so it forms like a triangle with both eyes and that spot.

It doesn't go away even if I close my eyes or try to relax them. I don't take any medicines because I don't know what it can be. It happens most often in the night, so normally when I wake up it's gone, but today it's still painful and it's been more than 12 hours since it started.

Alright, so I'm wondering if there is any connection between Impetigo and Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis).

Short story, I've got Impetigo (In the pubic area), but was unsure how did I get it and from who, I was suspecting my girlfriend, but she had no visible marks (Only felt ""itchy"" on the inside). I've noticed these smalls bumps that kinda ""exploded""..etc and my doctor said it was impetigo, I've checked the pictures and it's 100% Impetigo. I've managed to cure it at that time with antibiotics and topical antibacterial cream, everything was gone, she also didn't feel any ""itchiness"" anymore.

A few months later I get it again, one more time she has no marks and I get one small bump. What we've figured out is that maybe it could be connected to her Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)?  
We were together for 24/7 this whole month so there is no chance one of us got it from someone else, nobody is living with us.

Is it possible that her skin condition (Eczema) causes this Impetigo somehow? When she eats certain foods she gets painfully rash kind of thing on her palm hand.

Height: 5'2
Weight: 119lbs
Race/Ethnicity: Hispanic

Primary Concern: concerned about the number of antibiotics I've taken and unsure how to coordinate between doctors

Existing Medical Issues: 
Slight anemia [Low Ferritin (6ng/mL 01/23/20) hemoglobin (10.5g/dL 01/23/20)], undifferentiated connective tissue disease, celiac, and PCOS

Current Medication: 
Doxcycline 100mg 2x a day and clindamycin 1% topical (started 06/12/20), Zoloft 100mg 1x a day, and Adderall 20mg 2x a day, gummy multivitamin 1x a day, Zyrtec 1x a day,


Drugs / Alcohol: alcohol (1-2x a month), nicotine 3mg daily (vape)


I've taken antibiotics 6-8 times a year for different infections (UTI, BV, skin infections, strep, etc). So the gynecologist will prescribe levofloxacin for reoccurring UTI's  hoping to knock them out for good about a week after the dermatologist prescribes doxycycline and topical clindamycin for cysts.

This is after taking minocycline (sp) for a month last year (for the same cysts) and two years of taking either nitrofurantoin or cephalexin and later levofloxacin (depending on whether it's klebsiella, staph, or e. coli) for UTI's.

What happens when I get a serious infection and nothing helps because I've taken everything twice over?

I don't want to appear difficult or give off the impression that I don't trust them by questioning their recommended treatment (no matter how chill I feel, I get the impression my questions are viewed as dramatic or ridiculous). No offense, but I'm hoping to have fewer appointments and see fewer specialists. 

It feels as though I am adding risk every time I step into an office or complete a round of antibiotics. 

I don't want to take two different antibiotics if one would work just fine.

The last time I had an mri I was told that I might have bone/blood cancer which was traumatizing, and this is bringing back those memories. I know that contrast enhanced mri’s are usually used when infections/tumors are suspected, which makes me worried—why order one w/ contrast?

Currently taking trintellix and vyvanse daily and the only notable medical history I have is a long battle with anorexia (3+ years recovered) and a round of ECT I still experience mild memory issues from.

Three weeks ago while I was at home with my boyfriend I had a strange episode that started with pain in my abdomen. I got very dizzy very fast and began to see stars/lose vision and become somewhat confused and was not able to get my words out the way I normally would. I laid down on the floor and my boyfriend called an ambulance once my arms and legs started to shake and my lips turned blue and I continued to not be able to speak normally. The episode seemed to have passed by the time the EMT’s finished taking vitals so I opted not to go to the hospital. The next day I woke up feeling dizzy and confused again so I then went to the ER to be safe and every test they ran came back totally normal. Since the episode started with abdominal pain they checked that my IUD has not perforated something and told me everything looked normal and to come back if it happened again. 

This Wednesday when I woke up the vision in my right eye was blurred. I thought it would go away by the time I got to work, but it is now Friday afternoon and nothing has changed. There was no injury to the eye and it is not painful, but it is blurred enough that I cannot read with it if I close my left eye and if both eyes were this blurred I would definitely not drive.

hc8u39,Does my two year old really need to wear sun screen all the time?,"Hey Docs,

so I have a two year old kid, we are living in Berlin, so its not the sunniest place on earth. And with the current situation going on I know that Vitamin D deficiency is not the best thing to have right now.

My question is, my wife tends to cover our daughter with sun cream (factor 50+), face, hands etc. everytime she feels she might be exposed to sunshine. We tend to fight over this, me saying that its too much. I understand that sun protection is important, but not every second, like, if we stay all day at the beach in the sun (which we dont) I understand that, but to protect her from *every* sun beam, isnt that too extreme? 

How does that work with her Vitamin D? Wouldn’t it be better to go out, let her take 10-20-30 minutes of sun and maybe *then* apply the cream? Or, just let her wear a sun hat and be aware of the sun/playing under a tree etc and having no sun cream applied?

Could you enlighten a worried father, thanks.

hc8vgw,"Can anyone PLEASE help me, I’m at the end of my wits.","I’m an extreme sports athlete, the sport I do involves a lot of twisting, kicking and somersaulting. 

Around 4 months ago I got diagnosed with sciatica due to a disc bulge. I have EXTREME pain in my left piriformis and the occasional tingling in my left shin. The MRI results were as follows:


At the upper 3 lumbar discs no disc bulge or thecal sac compression is shown. 

The foramina are well maintained. 

At L4/5 there is some moderate central and left paracentral disc bulging with indentation of the thecal sac. Disc material lies against the origin of the left l5 nerve root. 

The intervertebral foramina are well maintained.

At L5/S1 the disc is degenerate and narrowed. There is no posterior annular tear. Disc material lies adjacent to the S1 nerve root bilaterally but these do not appear compressed. 

The intervertebral foramina appears quite well maintained. 

My first issue is, despite it being 4 months and having spoken to several physios, due to lockdown I’ve been unable to actually SEE a physio, I’ve had phone calls but no one has explained exactly what has happened to my back and why it is so painful all the time. 

No one has explained what my MRI results mean and no one has told me what my recovery process should be, or how long it will take. 

I feel like I’ll never do the sport I’ve done my whole life again, I’ve tried everything but surgery and my physio offered to refer me for surgery after our last phone call but I don’t want to take it until all of my options are exhausted - I’ve read that after a microdiscectomy sometimes you still have sciatica anyway. 

I also got diagnosed just before we went into lockdown so I haven’t been face to face with a doctor since my diagnosis.

hca8yt,Treatment for boil?,"26, female, 140 lbs, white, no previous conditions or medication 

Last Sunday I was resting my elbow on a hard surface and when I got up I felt some discomfort and noticed a red bump on my elbow. It was red and the area around it to about a quarter size was red too and very very tender. the surround redness is now settled down, but there is still a raised bump. Maybe the size of a lentil, a bit smaller though. 

There is a VERY tiny white head on it; but the size of the white part hasn’t changed since monday. It doesn’t look ready to “pop”. There is a pin point black dot on top of the white head. Still pretty tender and it’s in the area that touches surfaces when I rest my elbow on things so it’s very annoying

It isn’t getting bigger, but it isn’t getting smaller and doesn’t seem like it’s “progressing” either. It looks kind of like a zit, but google is pointing me toward thinking it’s a boil. 

My questions:
Can I treat this at home and make it go away? I read a lot about how messing with it at home could cause a serious blood infection and it freaked me out. I really want to get rid of it but don’t want to bother a doctor unless necessary (also the $)

What I thing might be causing this is I used to take a medication named cyproheptadine, but a week ago I had to stop taking it because I ran out of it and my prescription expired two days before. It is a antihistamine and it has worked greatly for the entire year I was taking it. A day after I stopped taking it I had severe insomnia and literally didn’t sleep for three days straight before i managed to get a 4 hour sleep. I have improved slightly since, but it’s still a maximum of 5 Hours of sleep that I have gotten. I eventually looked it up and I found that withdraw symptoms included disturbance in sleep schedule.

I never learned much about it or got much prior treatment or knowledge on it, mostly due to absent/abusive parents. 

Recently I went to the emergency room, because I've been dealing with awful pain in my left side, and I wasn't able to use the bathroom. I thought I was impacted. So while I was in the ER, they gave me a CT scan, a pelvic ultrasound, and a vaginal ultrasound. They did several blood tests as well. 

Mainly I'm confused because of the fact they sent me home, after the doctor pressed on my stomach and concluded my pain was just from gas.. But looking back on the test results they released online, I'm confused as to why I didn't hear more about my ""large right cyst"". And why it wasn't removed considering they measured it at 10cm? I'm reading online they'd remove a large one at 2cm.. So why on Earth is there still a cyst in there? Lol. Why did they send me home?

* Around November, I came on with  sudden onset hypertension.  I went to the doctors on a Tuesday for chest pain and was given three meds (omeprazole, dicyclomine, meloxicam).  At the time, my bp was **116/73**.  I reacted badly, went back to the doc just four days later and got an initial BP reading of **160+/100+.**  BP was taken again and recorded as **140/86**.  I stopped taking all but the omeprazole, which I took a few times a week as needed and discontinued almost two weeks ago. 
* Ever since, I received erratic numbers:  In January, I returned to the original doc and got an initial reading of **160/90-100**. BP was taken again and recorded as **141/82**.  Later that month, I went to a GI and got **138/90** (82 bpm); I went back a few days later and got **122/79** (85 bpm).  I went to the ER in January when I thought I was having a hypertensive crisis and got **179/100**, which was immediately remeasured with a larger cuff and got **127/84**, then **127/82** later, then **133/86** before being discharged.  
* In May, I got a home monitor and went to a cardiologist.  My home monitor daily averages ranged from **148/98** to **127/79** (my initial readings were still high but I got much better at calming myself down after multiple readings).  A nurse cousin brought me a manual cuff to check my home monitor, she read **160/100**,  dropping to **140/80**.  
* My doctor ordered a 24H monitor.  I was extremely anxious all day, and didn't sleep so much as a wink all night.  All readings were either sitting or lying down.   
 My daily average was **152/90**, with a daytime average of **157/94** and a nighttime average of **136/79** (even though I didn't actually sleep *at all*).  Of course, there are just averages--some of my numbers were crisis level.  In fact, I got the absolute worst readings I've ever seen on the 24H cuff. 
* After seeing these results, my cardiologist prescribed **5mg, the lowest possible dose, of olmesartan (ARB)**.  We skipped the diet/exercise phase because I already have a good diet/lifestyle factors.  I've taken 5 doses over 4 days (I took two on one day to adjust my daily consumption from morning to evening).  
* Today I measured using a home manual cuff and my average over multiple readings was **117/77**, with highs of 130 SBP and 80s DBP, and lows of 100 SBP and 70 DBP.  That's a  dramatic drop given that I've been on the lowest-dose olmesartan for just four days, during which time I have cumulatively consumed the equivalent of the standard 20mg dose.  The literature I've seen says that you'd expect on average a *21/16 pt drop* on a *standard 20mg dose* over *8 weeks*.  Understanding today is just one data point, I've seen a *35/13 pt drop* on a low *5mg dose* over *four days*.  
* Possible confounders include discontinuing the omeprazole last week (a few days before the 24H monitor and a week+ from todays numbers), much diminished appetite over the last several days due to anxiety, a nonprofessional using a manual cuff instead of an automatic cuff, and slightly restricting water (which seems to help with a symptom I'd been having where the pressure in my head was crushing when I bent over). 
* **Here's my question**: Part of my blood pressure challenge was trying to understand how much could be chalked up to anxiety and how much was 'true' hypertension.  The 24H cuff seemed to confirm it was real.  But seeing a dramatic BP drop so soon after starting a child's dose of an ARB has me wondering if there's also a placebo effect and the knowledge of being on meds is reducing my anxiety, and thereby compounding the reduction of BP.  I'd love to not be a 'true' hypertensive at such a young age and to not need to be on meds for the rest of my life.  Note that I'm not going to discontinue a med absent dr's orders.",2,6,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hcsjd0/sharp_drop_in_blood_pressure_after_just_three/"")",2020-06-20 12:48:28,Physician Responded

hcwi1q,18M - Spots on penis,"18M
White African
173cm tall 
93kg

Hi, so I’ve had spots on my penis for a while, generally on the side. They’re not really spots but patches of skin that are a bit silky and a lot lighter in colour. My penis is pretty dark so it’s easy to tell where they are. 2 years ago, I went to the doctors and they didn’t know but they gave me some DERMOL cream and an anti-fungus. I used it but it didn’t really affect it and I’d occasionally buy some over the counter when they ran out. Considering how far apart I used them, I doubt they worked. However, my spots did decrease to the point where I barely noticed them (they were still noticeable, I just got used to it) and I forgot about them. Now the spots have all but gone on the side but there has been one on the underside of my penis for almost a year. That’s the main one that’s not shrinking and I haven’t used an anti fungus for over 6 months now (at a guess). I’ll upload pictures in case anyone can guess what they are, and I’ll upload the one on the side that is small.

Thanks everyone and keep up the good work concerning the current crisis

Prescribed ldn about four months ago from a tmj dr who said she didn't think that it's TMJ causing all of my issues like a previous dentist said.

The LDN helps a bit more than anything else so far but I am having *horrible* neck pain that seems to be a flare but I feel like it’s much worse now than ever. I literally can’t do anything. I am home bound and struggling.

Previously in a few car wrecks maybe ten years ago? Whiplash injury in one and rolled in another. 

No matter what I do if I turn my neck or ride in a car or even press into a pillow I get a horrible deep ache and eventually end up in tears often. 

I personally suspect ms as I have some aching with my eyes here and there as well as bluriness but I’m not sure if that is from the lasik I had awhile ago or what. I’m also extremely heat sensitive. 
I also get tingling and numbness if I’m laying flat or sitting up straight. Occasionally I notice it in my tongue or mouth. I also leak urine/have to go all the time. 

I had an mri two years ago of my brain and cervical area and they didn’t find anything remarkable. I have also had trigger point injections and an epidural and they didn't do much at all. 

Physical therapy didn’t help much as I couldn’t do the exercises without horrible pain and crying there so she didn’t want to hurt me. We tried for over a year but my therapist was worried about what was causing the issue.


Migraine rescue meds have done little to nothing.

Daily: Any movement to my neck caused by turning it, pressure on it from too firm of pillow, walking, driving
Painful to sit up straight
Tingling in hands off and on 

Feel it on both sides of the neck but also pain down the center of neck - can be a burning or deep aching or stabbing/tingling, etc. 
Can go into a full blown spasm up into lower scalp - knots no matter what I do - have tried magnesium and a few diff types for a year at least now.

Neck brace can sometimes prevent a little bit of pain while in the car, etc.
Getting pressure and weight off my neck. 

PT was incredibly difficult as even just the lightest touch of me pushing my neck into a pillow can cause me horrible pain, spasms etc 

Pain lessens when I can put the weight of my head onto something soft 

Occasionally:

Occasional Tingling in tongue, back, butt, feet when sitting upright. 

Harder to maintain  balance than before - I lose balance fairly often at home.
Sometimes when laying down flat on my back or sitting up, my hand feels like I have been holding onto a mower.

hdh1zz,What else would doctors be looking for after two mri and 21 vials of blood?,"Hi there,
I'm a female, 40, 158 lbs, 5'7"", never smoked, very healthy most of my life up to May 5th of this year.  Since then I've been put on Gabapentin 300 mg twice a day and vitmin d.  Blood results have all come back normal except vitamin D.

May 5th began many crazy symptoms: numbness, pins and needles, feeling of icy hot on chest, tight band feeling around my waist and under one knee, sensory issues like my skin was burning, difficultly walking, fatigue, blurred vision, severe constipation etc.  At one point my husband was having to help dress me and I had to use a cane to get up and down stairs at my home.  Things slowly started to ease off, and now I just have heaviness in my legs, very faint burning feeling on skin and difficulty flexing feet up so still walking funny. I'm about to start physical therapy.

Urgent Care didn't know what it could be and told me I had to see neurologist.  CT scan was clear. 
PCP sent me to the ophthalmologist after floaters began on top of blurriness.  He spent about 2 mins with me and said he didn't see anything.

Neurologist was wonderful, spent an hour with me and said he suspected MS and wanted MRI done. MRI was completed with and without contrast on brain and C-spine.  Results stated both were clear, with the exception of mild protrusions in cervical spine.  My neurologist's office called to say I was being sent for a MRI on my thoracic and lumbar in a few days.  I was also scheduled for a spinal tap which I absolutely did not want.   I've heard horror stories about the headaches.

So my question is this: Wouldn't a clear mri of two places rule out MS?  I was originally told at first visit I would only need a spinal tap only if lesions showed on the MRI.  So I'm confused why I'm having one.

I was also told the symptoms just slowly disappearing actually wasn't a good sign.  If a nerve was trapped or a root was pressed on the pain would continue.  If it slacks off without explanation that could indicate I'm looking at something that could bring relapses.

Overall, just very confused.  I got the call Friday afternoon and after I digested couldn't call for clarification.

Thanks for reading.

I have no symptoms, no fever, no pain in the finger. It doesn't bleed anymore and its not achy. I have been cleaning it daily with 70% hospital grade alcohol on the surrounding skin and a tiny bit of chlorhexidine on the wound itself and also switching bandages ofcourse.

The wound looks smaller now maybe because of the healing process or/and a tiny bit of swelling but at the moment the accident happened it was bigger and deep enough to modify the outline of my fingertip leaving the flesh completely exposed and an actual chunk the size of a fingernail was chopped off.

Began in October 2019 with a small itchy, dry spot on right-hand index finger. Mid March 2020 developed fluid-filled vesicles on top of hand, finger, and on palms. These eventually would turn to dry itchy red patches and subside. These red patches come and go. I still occasionally get some fluid-filled vesicles that come and go within a few days, but it's never usually many of them. The most current and prominent way this condition has now been presenting itself is on the top of my hand and fingers with red, intensely itchy inflamed patches with no evident pattern. The itch is so bad that it's difficult to concentrate sometimes. I have tried switching soaps multiple times, limited exposure to touching things by wearing cotton gloves, and I can't seem to relate this to anything I'm touching. I have an appt in a year and a half to get allergy testing.

What's weird is that some protein sources are still tasting fine: tuna, salmon, shrimp, dairy products (cheese, yogurt, etc). Up until two weeks ago, I ate all these foods with no issues.

210lbs  
White  
Myasthenia Gravis - approx 7 years  
Non smoker, No drug use  
Occasional drinker (wine maybe 1 every 3 months)

Medications:  
Mestion 60mg x1 daily  
Prednisone 5mg x1 daily  
Mycophenalate Mofetil 500mg x6 daily (3g total)  
Birth control pack

My question isn't necessarily related to an issue or a problem I'm having. I'm mostly curious about the effects of medication and how they interact with the body. For example, I read in some medical journal (I think) that generally speaking, the body naturally produces the equivalent of 2.5mg of cortisol daily. Taking 20mg of prednisone is like having 8 times the amount of natural cortisol, which over time can lead to a cushingoid appearance (something I'm very familiar with). 

More specifically, I'm curious about the effects of an immunosuppressant (Mycophenalate mofetil) on the immune system - is there a formula where I can say XX dosage decreases the immune system by YY% so I'm ZZ% more likely to get sick? Or, if that's not the case is there an equivalent to help people that aren't familiar with immunosuppressants understand the nature? Like taking my dose daily is like getting so many rounds of chemo? (Thats a bad comparison but I hope it gets the idea across.)

I'm asking because it seems like a few of my colleagues don't understand that setting aside Myasthenia Gravis and it's effects on my breathing already, that the immunosuppressant I'm taking also makes me high risk for contracting COVID-19. They seem to feel some sort of way about me working from home.",1,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hdveis/is_there_a_way_to_compare_dose_and_the_effects_of/"")",2020-06-22 09:21:22,Physician Responded

They never really discussed my ECG. I was given the aforementioned rescue inhaler and some instructions to help the pleurisy and went home. 

My hospital posts all test results to a patient portal and I finally got around to looking at my ECG results, albeit almost a month later. It says I had/have sinus tachycardia (which I already knew), biatrial enlargement, rightward axis, and a nonspecific ST abnormality. They never discussed any of these findings with me and I didn’t even know about them until I looked in my portal. Should I be concerned? If they didn’t discuss them, should I just let it go? I don’t really know what any of that means and I don’t want to fall in a Google hole and freak myself out.",1,2,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hdy6u5/help_interpreting_ecg_results_im_confused/"")",2020-06-22 11:46:54,Physician Responded
hdyn4p,Former Grad Student With Constant Burning Head Pain,"[https://youtu.be/i8SMjzeua4w](https://youtu.be/i8SMjzeua4w) (To watch details)

(25F) Had to drop out of school because of the pain. A constant burning sensation on top of my head, which has been going on since August 2019. It is not on the left or right side, just in the middle. It’s mostly focused on one point on top of my head, kind of in a circle. It is worse/more intense when lying down or not moving for a while. It feels like someone took a chili pepper and put it on top of and inside my head permanently. Since December 2019, the pain has started to spread to other areas of my head. It's mainly focused on the top and is always burning, but now I'll get some pain on both sides on the top or sides. No nausea, no sensitivity to light/sounds/touch/smells, or any other associated symptoms. Nothing makes it better, and it doesn't go away. I have trouble sleeping due to the burning sensation. Pain is always at 5/10, increases to 7/10 when lying down or staying still for 30 mins or longer. Occasional neck/trapezius muscle pain; neck sometimes ""clicks"" when moved, but it never did this before the headache started.  

Prior history of cerebral palsy (spastic diplegia), due to premature birth. Mild constipation requiring daily suppositories starting 3 years ago, after previous history of no bowel problems. No history of headache or family history of headache.  Current illness started in mid-August 2019. I was not doing anything special at this time (was a student, had summer off). Did not deviate much from normal routine. Swam and was outside a lot exercising before headache/burning sensation started. Flew on a plane to Texas and back to Maryland a few days before headache started. Had a pressure-like feeling behind nose for about a week before headache started (thought it was a sinus infection, but then it went away). I do not remember exact day headache started. Headache did not start gradually, but just came on full force and has not stopped. Had one episode of overactive/spastic bladder, with continual pain in urethra all the time, about 7 weeks before headache started. Resolved spontaneously after about a month. Had not previously had bladder issues. I had received new carbon fiber AFO leg brace for spastic gait (due to cerebral palsy) two months prior to headache onset. Tested positive for Lyme disease 2 weeks after headache started (from labs ordered by PCP), but only the IgG was positive (positive EIA, negative igM, positive IgG). I took 3 weeks of doxycycline and now EIA test is negative. Because only the igG was positive, doctors think it was a false positive and is not now causing the headache. Doxycycline did not help headache.

hdzq10,Care for deep cut without stitches,"Hi!

Yesterday I jumped off the boat right on an oyster shell. I ended up staying at the beach for a few more hours. When I got home I took a shower and tried to clean it with soap and water.  Then I poured water and hydrogen peroxide over it. I applied antibiotic cream and covered it with a bandaid. Cleaning it was incredibly painful. Like near tears. 

My husband was adamant that it needed stitches, but he is much more risk adverse than I am. I didn’t really think it was worthy of a trip to the hospital. 

It looks like it cut through all the layers of skin. It didn’t bleed though. I later read that hydrogen peroxide might not have been a good idea (oops).  When I woke up there is some blood on the bandaid. It doesn’t appear to be red or swollen. 

Can you tell if I needed stitches? Is red and swelling all I need to be aware of as far as infection?

Hi, thanks for reading!


My mum got taken to hospital on Saturday afternoon in an ambulance as her and my step dad feared she was having a mini stroke.Up until then she was 100% mentally fine. She was generally confused and repeating things that day but the final straw leading to my step dad calling the ambulance was when he said to her that he's going into the other room and she should call him if she needs him and she responded ""I don't have your phone number"". He said ""Its in your phone"" and she looked at her phone like it was an alien device. She is normally completely tech literate and uses it everyday and has done for years so this is as unusual and out of character as anyone else in this day and age saying that. 


Due to corona virus my step dad had to follow in his car and was not allowed into the hospital. So from here on out I was dealing with my very confused mother by text message and my step dad sat in the car park getting no more information than me. I live hundreds of miles away. 


She text me saying ""they think"" she has had a T.I.A (Transient ischaemic attack)/mini stroke. And ""they think"" there might be slight weakness on her left side. 


I then got a confused update off her a bit later basically saying:

""My memory's still bonkers. 1st brain scan didn't show anything conclusive so they want to give me an MRI later. They think it's Encephalitis"".


She doen't know what type of scan that was but says it was tube that her head and shoulders fitted into.


My next update was a couple hours later when I phoned her and I think the doctors had a shift change or something as she said that a new consultant came over and read her notes and decided it was Transient global amnesia (T.G.A) without even trying to speak to her or without knowing the phone incident.


She was then discharged a couple of hours later and my step dad was phoned to pick her up and she didn't get the MRI.


From what I have read, a TGA episode only lasts 1-10 hours and the patient should of returned to normal within 24 hours. As said at top of this post, she is now at approximately 52 hours and still repeating things 2 minutes after she said them. Also from what I have read, TGA doesn't effect ""normal cognition, such as the ability to recognize and name familiar objects and follow simple directions"". This doesn't align with her symptoms either. 


I have asked her if they told her how long this will last and if maybe in some circumstances TGA lasts longer than 10 hours but she said the consultant just said ""its nothing to worry about, you'll return to normal functioning soon"". 


I am trying to put my trust in the doctor(s) but from what I have read, in addition to my mum's persisting symptoms I can't help but feel concerned they may have got this wrong? They haven't even given her advice on what to do if it doesn't subside or if it gets worse. 


I really appreciate and insights or thoughts on this.

Balance issues, fatigue, very tight muscles despite stretching, night sweats/excessive sweating even during day, gaining weight and inability to lose weight despite exercising regularly and eating relatively healthy. Symptoms started somewhat suddenly almost 2 years ago and have not improved with PT.

Have had complete neuro workup done, as they suspected MS. MRI, EMG, muscle biopsy all normal. Also had every blood test imaginable, including ANA and rheumatologic workup, all normal.

The following were abnormal: WBC has been tested twice in last year and was 4.10 both times (low), C-Reactive Protein was 3 last year and 4 this year, Copper level has been high, ranging from 189-220, but neuro didn't treat because no copper in 24-hour urine, and ceruloplasm was on high end of normal, but normal. Copper was retested last week and is still at 196.

Why are they ignoring the high copper? It's been at this high level since they tested it the first time over a year ago.

So I recently had a tattoo done. I got what looked like a pimple near it, and then suddenly many more followed. I followed my after care as I had with every other tattoo. I spoke to a doctor over telehealth (nowhere near me was open) and got a prescription for cephalexin. This was about 22 hours ago and the area hasn't improved, seems more red and swollen slightly. They didn't really give a clear diagnosis, just that it was infected and to go in person if it was not better in 48 hours. I guess I'm just looking for opinions on what specifically could this be, and when the meds will start to help.

he42pf,"Chalazion on eyelid, trouble for 6 months","**The photo that seems to be pinned to this post is from January, it’s not that swollen still!**

I’m a 23F. I have been dealing with a stubborn chalazion on my left eyelid since January of this year. Disclosure: I am 38 weeks pregnant now, so I’ve had to use less aggressive medications throughout the process. I do not (have never) smoke or drink alcohol. I’m not sure what else to include but will answer any questions.

If you make it through this whole post, you’re an angel haha

It all started when I woke up in the first week of January and my eye was almost swollen shut. The day before it was completely normal! [Photo here](https://imgur.com/a/C0oUamo)

I have a family friend who is an optometrist that I have gone to throughout my life for vision tests and check ups. I called him immediately and he called in erythromycin eye ointment and antibiotic eye drops. I used the ointment at bed time on the lid for a week and one eye drop twice a day. 

The swelling then went down to a barely-there bump after two weeks. [Photo here](https://imgur.com/a/CStoKTc)

I was happy and discontinued the drops per the optometrist’s instructions. However, it kept getting bigger. He said to continue the ointment and do warm compresses and we’d see what happens. Unfortunately I don’t think I was pushy enough, and after a month it had grown quite large. [Photo here](https://imgur.com/a/vP2J07u)

He then referred me to an ophthalmologist who couldn’t see me for a while, but they were the only one in my area. I scheduled a removal for April. By then it looked like this: [photo](https://imgur.com/a/Ysg539I). In the mean time I did the ointment and warm compresses, but I admit, after a while I was losing hope and was not doing the compresses as often as I probably should have.

The ophthalmologist did a procedure from the inside where he flipped my eyelid, made a small cut, cleaned it out (I thought) and then sealed it. My after care instructions were to use ointment on the inside of the lid (I put it in the bottom lid pocket, close my eye, and wiggle it around so it gets under the top lid) and do warm compresses multiple times a day. One week later it looked like this: [photo](https://imgur.com/a/4aCd7Zw)

Nothing noticeably changed, so he brought me back in and did another procedure. This time from the outside on the lid. My instructions for after care was to continue using the ointment under my lid twice a day and warm compresses. Two days after the procedure it looked like this: [photo](https://imgur.com/a/E8Y6Esx) 

He told me to call the office with an update after a week. I did so and let him know I didn’t think it was going down. He told me it was scar tissue that could take a month or longer to go back down. I was also told from there he really could only refer me to a oculoplastic surgeon.

Now we come to the end of my long post. 6 weeks post procedure, and the bump is still there, still hard, and now has these tiny bumps on it. [Photo here](https://imgur.com/a/srI62Hx). The little bumps are fairly new, maybe within the last week. One is more noticeable to me, the other I didn’t really notice without flash. 

At this point I don’t know what to do. I almost feel like the ophthalmologist doesn’t really know what to tell me. I wasn’t seeing any change after a few weeks, so I do admit that I haven’t done a warm compress in weeks. But seriously after five months I may scream if that’s the only advice a doctor can give me haha 

Is there any advice on who to ask or what to try? I guess if I just look like this from now on I can get over it...

This past Saturday (6/20/20) at maybe 9 PM, I (24M) was snacking on some in-shell sunflower seeds and believe I accidentally swallowed one of the shell halves. I felt it get stuck, which I'd experienced in the past with food, but it wasn't restricting me from swallowing other things or breathing so it wasn't a big deal. When it's happened before it normally passes in a few minutes. It was uncomfortable but didn't really hurt. Fast forward to Sunday night and it's still there. I legit could feel it shifting as if it was in a pocket and was slowly sliding out of it a little and then back in when I swallowed. I lost hours of sleep that night over it because it was so bothersome. Monday morning rolls around and it's still there, I can still eat, drink, and breath just fine. I call into an ENT specialist that I'd gone to before to have it checked. He proceeded to use a camera, going from my nose to my throat, to check everything out. He concluded that there was definitely nothing in my throat anymore and that there was some irritation, which is to be expected, and sent me home with some numbing/pain meds (Lidocaine). I haven't used it yet as I just picked it up this morning, but it's because I swear that this doctor had to have missed something. It's aching a bit still, not only in my throat but also downwards towards my chest too. The feeling that I had Saturday night and Sunday morning is still the same and can still feel it shifting, or at least that's what I believe it to be. The doctor seemed to be thorough in his search so I want to believe him, but this feeling is more believable. Am I just crazy and should give it an extra couple days for the feeling and aches to subside? Is this something more serious that I need to get checked out with an x-ray or something?

I get cysts, always have done. Usually they are no problem - had one on my chest for nearly 20 years now - but the latest has been a bugger to deal with.

It came up about a year ago on my shoulder and minded its own business, just a non-painful lump. 10 days ago though it got very red and inflamed. I did a couple of days of hot poultices and that drew some stuff out but then stupidly asked my wife to give it a squeeze and it may have ruptured.

Went to the doctor to get it cut out yesterday and he said it was too inflamed to do the job and I'd have to let it heal up first. He put a series of cortisone injections into it and recommended to cover it with petroleum jelly and a sterile gauze every day and to come back next week.

Is there any way I can speed up the process? I was thinking of mixing antiseptic ointment into the jelly, or maybe leaving it uncovered to dry out, as I'm home every day now. Any thoughts? Seems it's going to take more than a week to heal at the current rate.

I was recently diagnosed with Covid-19 last Friday and have been showing symptoms for exactly a week now. Overall my symptoms have been fever, headache, body aches, brain fog, faintness, fatigue. Symptoms were most intense for the first 3 days but even then were pretty mild and after that I’ve felt a lot better but a bit fatigued. 

Last night for about 5-10 minutes I started experiencing kaleidoscope vision. I was seeing light and movement that wasn’t there and my vision became blurry and spotty. At the time I had no other symptoms that came along with it besides getting really hot which seemed anxiety induced. I’m terrified because I’ve heard covid is giving young/healthy people strokes. 

Is this something to be worried about? Should I go to the ER? While it was happening I didn’t have any other wierd symptoms.

Hi so just over a year ago I got an MRI scan for a friend of a friends PhD project. I can't really remember what the research was for but it wasn't medical I think it was more of a psychology/neurology thing (can't actually remember what she does lol) so basically they wouldn't have been able to tell me if anything looked weird on the scan because they just weren't qualified for that and the project wasn't for that.A few months later my mum died of a brain aneurysm, super sudden and came out of nowhere. Her dad died of the same thing so I am now extremely concerned that this is in my future. I have been having a few issues with remembering how to spell words and remembering basic objects (forgot the word 'tray' this morning for example) and I'm concerned I have a brain tumor. I am a massive hypochondriac anyway even before this happened so I'm 99% sure I don't really. I've taken a brain function and memory test online and the answer seems to be that I'm pretty low risk. I want to just take a chance and see if my brain scan shows any possible abnormalities and whether it's worth getting another scan.

Here is a picture of the scan:  [https://imgur.com/a/cB10rIF](https://imgur.com/a/cB10rIF)

I don't even know if its even possible to know from the pictures but it's worth a shot.

heihsn,My stye popped but its leaving behind a scar... please help! :((,"Hello! I'm a 17 year old female who is 5'2 and weighs 103 lbs (initial post got deleted for not including this information). 
 
Stress, lack of sleep, hormones all over the place... and I got a stye.

A big one right under my eye. It hurt. A lot. The stye started swelling and bruising, too. After 4 weeks of warm compresses, it started forming a small pimple-like head and then, 2 days ago, it leaked pus out of the pimple-head-hole while I was pressing the compress to it.

My mother did a bit of squeezing to get rid of the ""pus"" and ""infected blood."" The stye eventually ""popped"" and the root of it came out.

It's noticeably smaller now and doesn't hurt anymore, but I'm very worried for my stye as it heals. The pimple-like-head left behind a hole, and I'm worried that it will leave a pit scar. The bloody scab on the hole fell off during a shower ... there have been no signs of re-scabbing.... now a rather noticeable hole remains...

Background info: both sides of my family have a history with styes. Both my parents frequently got it in their youth, often resulting in surgery. Personally, this is my 5th stye. All of my styles have been on my right eye, but the last 2 (including the current one; both occurring in 2020) have been on my left eye, although in different places (my last was on my bottom lashline... this one is underneath my eye where the ""baby eyebags"" would be. 

My questions are: 1) how likely is it that the pit will completely heal? 
2) what can I do to get it towards a complete healing with no scarring?
3) what can I do to prevent anymore styes from occuring?",2,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/heihsn/my_stye_popped_but_its_leaving_behind_a_scar/"")",2020-06-23 10:06:30,Physician Responded

hem4tr,My neighbor (36M) dropped dead in front of me. I failed to resuscitate him. Hoping to get better understanding of his cause of death.,"This happened a month ago and I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place but it was a traumatic event for me and I think having some potential logical explanations might help me move on.

My neighbor (who I didn’t know at all really) was a 36 year old male, slightly overweight. He worked construction I believe. I was out front of my house when his truck drove down and he kind of pulled into his parking space a bit erratically but I didn’t think much of it and was busy with my daughters. After what felt like a couple minutes (but was actually 12 mins according to my security camera), another neighbor screamed and said “he’s not breathing” and asked me for help. I called 911 and immediately helped get him out of his truck and onto his back. He was blue. Me and another man took turns doing chest compressions until rescue arrived. They were able to get a pulse back but he ended up dying a week later. 

He and his wife had a brand new baby. They don’t speak English and so when I asked her what had happened she told me as best she could that it was not a heart attack. That it was respiratory arrest. That he had a form of syncope. 

I actually have syncope myself (neurocardiogenic syncope and take beta blockers) and didn’t want to ask any further questions. Just wondering how such a young guy can go from driving one second to just not breathing the next. As far as I know, my doctors have never told me I might just faint one day and stop breathing as a result. I’m guessing this is a different kind of syncope.

My nan is booked in for a hysterectomy end of July for ovarian cancer, suspected around stage 3. I’m terrified, what can I do?

Please someone direct me to a more suitable subreddit if there is one I thought assumed this might be the place.

On the 9th of June my nan was rushed into hospital for pains and then diagnosed with cancer, she has a mass in her stomach which is like a pregnancy I’m told. She’s so frail and skinny but her stomach is really bloated. The main issue for not having it done sooner is she has blood clots. She’s on clexane injections for 6 weeks before they will operate. She has to then self isolate for 14 days completely ok the 13th of July before they will operate and the operation date roughly takes us to 7 weeks from the day of diagnosis. I’ve moved back from London to basically be a full time helper/emotional support. She lives with my grandad but he’s 76 as well and having a young man around the house I cook their meals every day, get things from the shop, clean around the house etc. My nans home from being agile and self sufficient to very weak and mostly resigned on the sofa and that’s a hard toll on her mental health. I make sure she eats but with the bloating and the mass she currently eats 60/70% of what she used to which is still quite good. I am so terrified that it might be a trouble waiting that long. I’m in the process of getting a couple of second opinions privately. Even if they could do it a week or two earlier we’d happily pay. Is there any words of comfort/help you can give me right now?

hen154,Concerning hand and nail symptoms after IV abuse of amphetamines.,"I am a 24 year old Male, weigh 160lbs, I vape nicotine often. 

these symptoms have persisted a few days. 

It is worth noting that I have abused amphetamines in high recreational doses about 6 or 7 times a year for the past three years. 

Meds: I currently take lamictal 250mg twice daily for epilepsy. 

I also take the following vitamins, supplements, etc:


———————-

Kratom 4g once daily (twice daily about 4 times a month, just started this a month ago)

Multivitamin 


400mg magnesium glycinate lysinate once daily.


To minimize toxicity: 250mcg of the research peptide BPC-157 twice daily, intramuscular. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11978191/)

Coenzyme Q10 once daily.

Phenibut 2g - 3g (as needed for anxiety and/or insomnia twice or thrice a week).

Pressed Alprazolam bars (supposedly 2mg). As needed for severe anxiety. Once a week lately. I can’t be sure of the doses. I can be certain that it is indeed alprazolam (not some research benzo) because I use a marquis reagent test each time I buy a batch. (I usually buy 60 or so pills at a time.) 

10mg of memantine HCl once daily concurrent with amphetamines use. (Only take when I have amphetamines). I use this to prevent tolerance build up and as a light antidepressant.  (This link does a better job of explaining and has links to peer reviewed papers on it. If on mobile, device t may prompt you to install the app, just click ‘open in new tab’ instead. to bypass it.

https://medium.com/@pharmakeus/memantine-as-a-neuroprotective-memory-enhancing-agent-and-potentially-effective-adjunct-to-19757a1bbcd6)



I also drink in excess twice a week over the past 3 months. 

—————————

As the title said, this happened two days ago after intravenously administering
 2-Fluoromethylamphetamine 2-FMA). 

I hope I’m being a hypochondriac, but my nail beds seem to have a small bit of blood under them and there was a pus filled bump (idk what classifies an abscess to be honest) next to the finger nail. There is also a weird bump thing or two on my forearm. 

I’m going to be including a few pics I took of it all at the bottom of the post

My heart rate was at roughly 115-130bpm for 16 hours straight (pretty normal whenever I used). 

I practiced sanitary IV habits (bacteriostatic water, actual filters, clean syringes, isopropyl alcoholic wipes, warm pads pressed against the injection site for ~5min afterwards.)

Both injection sites I used (crooks of the arms) are free of any lumps or abscesses , and the sites aren’t warm at all.

Just to be clear - I’m sick of the constant anxiety and the depression that follows a binge, so I will no longer partake in such a destructive hobby. I’ve seriously had enough and I refuse to go through this again. My largest problems are with amphetamines and alcohol and I’m truly working on it.


  I appreciate any and all concern y’all may have had though :)

History to headaches 
Concern about radiation from
Two Brain Ct scans

I am seeking professional opinions regarding the dangers of radiation exposure of the head due to two Cts I’ve received to diagnose headaches.

The first one, I was around 19 and at that time I didn’t realize the amount of radiation that the machine was delivering. It was a very brief test

Last year, I went to the ER due to an intense headache and visual disturbances. After waiting for a long time, the doctors decided to perform a head Ct with contrast. 

These tests were done in the span of three years. I am extremely worried that this exposure might lead to something terrible down the road. How dangerous is this exposure and have you encountered anything like this in your professional life? Does the machine use minimal amount of radiation for each slice or is the head exposed the whole time? Is one single dose worth six months of background radiation dangerous?

It’s sore and a deep pain that hurts when I move my eye. It only hurts on the outer corner of my eye. The redness gets pretty intense as well and it’s usually only on the outer half of my eye. This always goes away on its own after about a week but it’s annoying because eye drops don’t help at all. It goes away for a week then returns in the other eye with the exact symptoms. It’ll then go away for two months almost exactly to the day and return with the same symptoms. I’ve seen multiple ophthalmologists and they have not been able to diagnose it. I’ve been given antibiotics and they do not do anything to help either. One of my ophthalmologists told me it was just dry eyes but I don’t believe that either. Something more is going on. 

I’ve had a history of eye infections and I had a corneal ulcer at one point. I know this isn’t just pink eye or an infection as the eye pain and symptoms are not the same at all. I used to wear contacts daily and I thought it had to do with them so I stopped wearing them only to have this return. My parents both have different autoimmune diseases. I’ve done some google searching and it makes me wonder if I have one that is not diagnosed as well.

My father

* 62M
* Height: 1m80
* 80 kg.
* No smoking no drinking no drugs
* incoherent speech
* Aggressivity especially towards my mother

My father was suffering from his prostate for a year now and ignored it completely. Lately he decided to go see the doctor and discovered that there is a slight chance that he might have cancer.

My father is the religious type and had a large debt that he hid from us. He is afraid to leave this world without paying it back since he believes it will trouble him in his afterlife. The debt is a large sum, and we can't pay it soon enough for him.

According to my sister, since 3 mounths he has been rather forgetfull but nothing allarming. Like forgetting to thank god before eating and small details.

10 days ago he started calling all of us and telling us that we must embrace our religion and talk as if he was already terminally ill. But the day after, in the afternoon he completely shut his brain and stopped talking.

And then 8 days ago, he woke up and started mopping the floor around the house and when my mother tried to stop him he hit her without saying a world. He then went to the garden fully naked and my mother had to drag him inside. Since then, he didn't say a word and started wandering around the house. He has been diagnosed with dementia by a  psychiatrist and has been given Clorazepate to sleep, the next day he woke up, urinated on the floor and left himself naked again. He went downstairs and just slept on the floor.

The next days were absolute hell for my mother who had to deal with him each time he needed to pee and trying to force him to eat. He has hit her practically every day and always looks at her aggressively.

His own brothers finnaly came and decieded to take him to their home when he punched my mother and one of them. He has since calmed down but he still has yet to talk like a normal person.

Hospitals didn't accept him stating that there aren't enough rooms for them to take people who suffer from dementia.

I am living abroad now and can't go help my mother who is living alone with him and afraid that he would hit her again. Is it even possible for someone to just get dementia in just a couple of days?

At work, since I work with the public I have been keeping record of those I come into contact with in case I become infected I can reach out to those I've contacted. My big concern has to do with my martial arts training (Muay Thai) and possibly getting back in the gym. I would like to do a combination of these two activities up to 5 times per week. Of course, this really increases my overall exposure and it makes me feel a little guilty. I feel that I could really use these excercises especially for my mental health.

I have been having frequent headaches for a long time now. My mom says I have complained about headaches that were frequent since I was about 12. In the past few months, I have been waking up with headaches in the morning. They get a bit better throughout the day but sometimes they don't. I take Tylenol whenever I have these headaches and it gets rid of them most of the time. I am a bit worried that it could be something serious like a brain tumor. I get headaches pretty frequently, like multiple times a week. I don't have some other symptoms like seizures, loss of consciousness, or vomiting, but sometimes I do have a loss of balance. (Sometimes when I'm standing still or walking I kinda lose balance but I don't fall, could just be because I'm clumsy.) In the mornings when I get headaches my neck also hurts. I feel like it's out of place when I have my headaches. I keep thinking my headaches could be caused by the way I sleep because my parents say I always sleep in weird positions, or because I'm on the computer so long every day. But there's a part of me that is very scared about having a brain tumor. I have pretty bad anxiety as well. Should I ask my parents to take me to the doctor?

Primary complaint: Peeling and tiny itchy blistering on the sole of right foot only

Duration: Off and on for 10+ years

Medications: topical steroidal ointment as needed, topical Sorilux foam as needed, O’Keefes For Healthy Feet as moisturizer

About: as mentioned above, I have this recurring issue with my right foot. I have peeling skin on my heel and intermittent tiny blisters just below my skin on the arch that itch like crazy. The blisters get red and fluid filled, and will drive me crazy unless I lance them. Then they burn. The weird part is it kind of comes and goes, with no rhyme or reason. I went to my derm and he was puzzled. He gave me some steroid ointment and a non-medicated Vitamin D foam and neither really did much. I use O’Keefes For Healthy Feet to keep them moisturized because if they are dry they are very hot/uncomfortable. The issue with the blisters/peeling started when I was in college and just popped up one summer. It went away for a while then came back in the fall, now it’s pretty constant on a week to week basis. I had a flare up of the itchy bumps a few days ago that were lanced and since calmed down. The itchy bumps migrated from their original appearance on the sole of my foot to the arch; this happened over the course of the last 1-2 years. I wear socks in my shoes and replace my shoes often. My feet tend to smell bad like salt and vinegar chips after about a day. My feet don’t sweat much and I try to wear organic cotton footwear to allow them to breathe.

Apparently it’s very strange to have eczema unilaterally, and nowhere else. Any ideas?

I've been seeing a a doctor for a couple years now and he's been insistent on getting blood work done multiple times a year; I've often been able to shirk this, but it seems that wont be possible this time. I have congenital hypothyroidism, and have been on a stable dosage since my late teens, and when my pediatric endocrinologist stopped seeing me around 20, I was only getting tested once per yer.

Back to the situation at hand, I had blood work done in December at my annual physical. When my pharmacy called, he didn't order a refill. I called myself asking for a refill, and the receptionist told me that I had to come in. I asked if we could postpone, what with the epidemic, and was told I can't. I had enough and told the receptionist I'd be finding a new doctor (a bit of an emotional reaction, because I need a refill in 5 days). I sympathize that he *may* actually have my best interests in mind, but this just feels like a racquet; I only get my meds if they get their cut. It's a small clinic, and I started going there when briefly unemployed, and kept going mostly out of sheer convenience.

On to the questions. Is telehealth reputable? Is it cost effective? Is there a good way of shopping for doctors? I realize the optics on this last question isn't great, but I'm just trying to get my levothyroxine without being ripped off.

I've always been an active and healthy person with no pre-existing conditions. I smoke marijuana several times per week (usually) but I stopped three days ago. I have had random, sharp pains in the *exact* same places I did with my pneumonia previously. It had gotten so painful and my breathing was labored enough that at one point I almost went to the emergency room. I decided against it because I didn't have health insurance and figured I would survive.

I was given Albuterol when I was initially tested for COVID-19. It made breathing easier in April/early May but does nothing for the pain I have right now. The pain had gone away around Mid-may but has come back (albeit not as severe but still sharp) and I usually feel it randomly, several times an hour. It is more noticeable while lying down and trying to fall asleep. The only complaint I've had since mid-May was decreased lung capacity, which I expected anyway.

Are there common causes for this? Is there more information I need to give that I left out? I should also note that marijuana use after I felt better *never* seemed to cause any pain or discomfort. I could ""blaze"" my shit up and not feel any discomfort in my lungs. The pain randomly started while I was at a restaurant on the 21st and has stuck with me since.

I was also prescribed 15mg mirtazapine nocte for my depression about 3 weeks ago and pregabalin 300mg b.i.d. for IBS pain and anxiety about 7 months ago, though I started tapering the pregabalin down a few days ago with the intent to stop taking it in around 10-20 weeks since I feel it is doing me more harm than good. Since I have Asperger's and apparently there's a melatonin deficiency in those with ASD, I have been prescribed 8mg extended-release melatonin for about 10 years.

Sometimes scary things happened in them though usually not, but even so, I tend to wake up very distressed, heart racing as if I just had the most awful nightmare and it takes around an hour for my mind to transition from this false reality into reality.

However, around 3 weeks ago, I started getting these every single night and it's making me feel absolutely awful and really makes me feel far more depressed and anxious.

Duration of complaint 3 days I guess?? 

Existing medical conditions : anxiety / depression

Currently on sertraline

Hello, I'm really scared so I'm posting here to try and get your help. Since April I've been dealing with mental issues, I don't want to get into it too much but it essentially boiled down to extreme anxiety and intrusive thoughts. I went through a lot of different intrusive thoughts that caused me a lot of sadness and anxiety and I had frequent panic attacks. 

I ended up seeing my GP and she told me that I was going through an anxiety crisis and that I manifested some symptoms of depression too. She percribed me Sertraline that I have been taking everyday for about a month now. I generally can say I feel much better, don't have too many intrusive thoughts anymore and my mood is much much better.

But for the past 3 days I've been going crazy about something.. I noticed that now I always get the urge to ask people what they just said if I didn't hear them all the way through to the end of their sentence. Even if I'm not involved at all in the conversation. My mum was talking to my sister earlier and I didn't entirely hear what she said so I had to ask what it was and then the same thing happen again when my dad was talking to my mum.

Then I started freaking out again because I recognized I was obsessing about something again and the thought of schizophrenia crossed my mind and then I went to google and now I'm scared. The fact I had intrusive thoughts and now that I am ""dealing"" with this issue which I don't even know what it is and that I read that schizophrenia mostly  triggers in your 20s has me scared. Could I be developing it?? No one in my family has it as far as I know.

And another thing that's been really upseting me for a long time is that every day, especially towards the end of the day I start getting chest pains and my heart beat shoots up. Every single day and it upsets me a lot. A few weeks ago I understood why, because I was so anxious and sad and stressed all the time I thought it was natural but now I don't even feel anxious about anything, I don't have any intrusive thoughts and yet it still happens anyway. Anyone know what's up with that? Do I have a heart issue or is this still the anxiety?

hgxvdi,Cold Urticaria or Allergic Reaction?,"14M, Asian, 5’8, 125 lb, no drugs etc, avid runner. First post here so I have no idea if I’m posting all of the information I need

So today was a long run with my running group and it was relatively warm, being around 27° with 30% humidity. We ran 3 miles from my friends house to his grandparents’ house to chill in the pool, and it went pretty good at first. 

The pool was relatively cold compared to other pools and I think uses a different type of chlorine that I’m used to. After 5-7 minutes, my hand started flaring up in red, so I got out and realized my skin had loosened and became extremely swollen with hives breaking out in specific areas. I couldn’t bend over or backwards nor could I curl my legs or arms due to the swelling. My friend thought it was the chlorine and hosed me down with fresh water and then we continued the run.

About half a mile down, I started to experience difficulty breathing and my vision started to cede. Then shite went wack and my vision went completely static and I couldn’t breathe, collapsing on the ground. I supposed this was a mild anaphylactic incident. I had to take antihistamines, asthma medicine, and steroids to calm down the reaction.

I got two hypotheses. One, this was Cold Urticaria, as I immediately dived from the summer heat into the lower-than-average-temperature pool. This has occurred before when I used a frozen block of butter on my runner’s knee after a sweltering run, which left hives all over the area.

Second, this could’ve been an allergic reaction to the chlorine in the pool, but I’m not certain which brand. 

Sorry if this was formatted pretty badly as this is my first time on here and I’m kinda panicked to find out what the hell just happened to me.",1,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hgxvdi/cold_urticaria_or_allergic_reaction/"")",2020-06-27 10:42:37,Physician Responded
hgxwt6,"Mom (58F) died of a aneurysm rupture in front of me yesterday, I have questions","First of all sorry if this is not the right subreddit, I don't know where to ask this.

1. Just before it arrived she said that she did not feel so good and had a huge headache, she laid down and instantly started snoring, with her eyes wide open, why does this happen ?
2. he was not responsive to anything, the person on the phone ask me to pinch her really had and she had no reaction. But she was still breathing, it was a struggle and but it seemed easier for her to breathe when I was holding her in a sitting position. How was she still able to breathe if her brain was mostly already dead ?Even after paramedics showed up, at some point they made her breathe manually (I assume she stopped), but then she started breathing again on her own, heavily but kinda normally. (the doctor even pointed it out with a kinda optimistic tone)
3. Why did she vomit ?
4. At some point the doctor was trying to force some kind of angled metal tube in her mouth / throat, it was rather large. He struggled quite a lot to put it and remove it. It did not seem like a breathing device, I assume maybe it was some kind of optical device ? So that he could see if there was a blocage of something ? Any thoughts ?
5. When did they guess it was a aneurysm rupture ? I don't know what happened in the ambulance and when she was admitted, they did a scan and it confirmed the huge bleeding, but I guess they were already pretty sure before that ?
6. She technically died the morning after, because she was still showing very small signs of brain activity, but she did not have her hooked up to a brain scan the whole time, did they ? So I guess we don't really know when the brain death happens ?Also, for me I feel like I saw her die in front of me then saw her die again the next morning, at the ER doctor said that she was in a profound coma and she would die soon, but she was not technically dead since they were some signs of brain activity still. I don't know this confuses me.
7. Also the most important question : is there any way to roughly know when she lost consciousness ? I mean, she became instantly limp and unresponsive when it happened, but people in locked in syndrome are limp and unresponsive, and they are conscious... So is there any way to know if she was conscious while I was holding her ?

&amp;#x200B;

Also why are those questions bothering me so much despite the fact that I know it does not change anything.

hgyazm,Scaly skin lesions on palm.,"24F. Living in New Delhi, India. Not on any medication. History of allergic rhinitis on and off since childhood.
I've been getting scaly (like dry skin) skin lesions all over both palms. Including fingertips and joints. Mild itching rarely. No other issues. There is no redness or swelling or any other allergic reaction. Aggravated by washing hands with water, plain or with soap. Relief on using moisturizers but a few dry skin/scales stay behind. Started in February this year but resolved on it own in a few weeks. Thought there could be an issue with the water source but no one in the family has similar complaints. Symptoms began again 3 weeks ago and still persist. I do have hereditary eosinophilia. Could this just be allergic or maybe a vitamin deficiency?

hgyl31,Question about water intoxication,"Hi , 22 years old male here. My height is 183 cm and weight is around 78kg. I was exercising yesterday and didn't took much fluids all day and don't had any fluids during the exercise. I am new to exercising so though it wasn't such a taxing exercise it was new for my body. So after exercising I went to toilet then when I came out I felt thirsty. I grabbed 2 liter bottle and drank around half of it. So i drank around a liter of water. I already knew about water hydration but never conc in couple of minutes. Although I knew about water toxication I never worried about it because I normally have hard time drinking water because I don't like it a lot. So was shocked when I seen that I consumed around a liter of water in couple of minutes. I am now scared of water intoxication. It says drinking more than 800-1000ml in hour can cause water toxication and is dangerous. I haven't drank or are anything after drinking litre. I went to toilet eventually just after exercise so before drinking water and after drinking it I forced myself to pee so after drinking a litre I went to toilet after drinking it twice. In first one urine was quite brown. Then when I forced myself after some time to go to toilet second time again my pee was very very clear so i am really worried whether I over hydrated as it can cause brain damage because of swelling and such.

hgyvz2,A cyst?? on the right side of neck for over 12 months showing no sign of dying,"32 year old man no pre existing conditions 250lbs 5'8 from Illinois

So back in spring 2019 I told my Dr I found a bump on my neck and it seemed to be wet near it but that I I couldn't find a source. The Dr gave it 5 second look and called it a cyst said it would go away in a few months. The bump is more like a hard piece of tissue roughly as big as my thumbprint.

It's under the skin and doesn't move unless you push or pull the flesh but once you release it goes right back usually a little wet. 

It's still leaking occasionally and hasn't shrunk.

When should I be concerned about it?
Is this permanent after a year?
Should I ask for removal?

I’ve had this skin mole for a few years and I’m wondering if it’s of concern. I’m not sure if it’s changed in colour but the size has been consistent. It isn’t usually red or irritated or itchy but it can be if I’ve been touching it. 

Is this something to be worried about? Thank you!

hgzm2h,Question about cerebral edema/hyponatremia/overdose related to my sister's death.,"I'm asking because I have so many questions stuck in my head after my little sister died from an MDMA overdose on the 12th of June this year. The cause of death was cerebral edema and methamphetamine overdose. 

My sister took MDMA between 1-4 AM, She was admitted into the hospital on the 11th at around 5-6 AM, CT scan must have been done somewhere between 7-10 AM. We arrived at 3 PM.

She had around 2g between her and 4 other friends. She was taking caffeine pills at the time (I'm assuming due to her recent web history search on ""2g MDMA"" and ""0.3g MDMA + caffeine"" along with multiple empty caffeine pill packets around her dorm room and handbags) the MDMA was in powder form and I was told by one of her friends that my sister went back to the room to re-dose around 5-8 times, the same friend said she gave her water, about 3 bottles of 750ml, My sister drank all 3 bottles. Which could have been the cause for hyponatremia which led to the brain swelling. She was also reported to have seizures, vomiting and hit her head on concrete. 

I arrived with my mum and brother to the hospital on the 11th where they explained everything to us about her condition and the brain damage. The doctors/nurses said they were trying to give her medication and saline, however, they said it wasn't working as her body was flushing it all out through her urine. Could be due to kidney or liver failure?. They said they didn't perform emergency surgery, craniectomy, to relieve the pressure in her skull because ""it wouldn't do much"". Later that day they mentioned they were going to do something which I cannot remember to stabilise her because her brain stem was struggling. This is where we had to leave. 

The following day we were called to the hospital at around 2-3 PM. They performed a brain death test in which she was pronounced brain dead on the 12th at 1:04 PM. We asked to see the CT scan which showed my sister's brain going from normal grey/dark matter to completely white/grey? with no dark matter.

Similar to this CT scan -  [https://prod-images-static.radiopaedia.org/images/32492980/8de4d5d640602a0a8a7d026e4aa2bf\_big\_gallery.jpeg](https://prod-images-static.radiopaedia.org/images/32492980/8de4d5d640602a0a8a7d026e4aa2bf_big_gallery.jpeg) 

The doctor explained to us that her brain stem had been damaged, there was no blood flow to the brain and that the brain damage was too severe. 

If they had done craniectomy, would it have potentially saved her life? 

What are the treatments for hyponatremia?

What caused her body to refuse to absorb the medications/serum?

Did they mess up by doing the brain death test too early and shutting off the ventilator as she was overdosed, they didn't exactly wait 5 times the half life before doing the test? I'm only asking this question because of brain death mimic from hypothermia, overdosing on drugs and NHS guideline.

hgzukr,High cholesterol but not underweight -- do I need statin?,"EDIT: I meant ""overweight"".   


  
So, I'm due for another blood test because it has been over 6 months. Six months ago, my doctor told me that my ""bad"" cholesterol levels were too high. It was surprising to me in that I had always connected weight with cholesterol, and I've always been borderline underweight at 5'2 and 102lbs. However, I was basically only eating huge amounts of junky and processed foods.

Since then, I've started eating healthier -- lots of fish, poultry, whole grains, beans, vegetables, extra virgin olive oil, nuts, fresh herbs, and fruit.

I still eat ""junk"" from time to time but it's not every day for almost every meal. I also stopped drinking alcohol because I was also diagnosed as bipolar and so my bottle of red wine every two days habit needed to stop once I started medication.

I'm nervous that my cholesterol levels will still be high when I go back. My mom has high cholesterol and needs to take statins. She keeps telling me to take statins but I don't want to. I'm scared of them and their impact on memory. I have enough forgetfulness from the bipolar disorder. I don't need more. I don't think I have familial hypercholesterolemia because I've never had the cholesterol deposits beneath the skin. No other health issues other than the high cholesterol and bipolar.",2,10,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hgzukr/high_cholesterol_but_not_underweight_do_i_need/"")",2020-06-27 12:32:15,Physician Responded
hh00mk,Should my mom get a heart stent? I need immediate help. URGENT PLEASE!!!,"Hi,

I need an opinion immediately due to the condition of the hospital due to COVID.

Mom's Stats:
Female, Age 58, Caucasian, Non-Smoker, Non-Drinker, Weight: ~150 lbs., Height: 5'6

My mom had a TIA (transischemic attack) which is a mini-stroke in her eye last Saturday. Her left forearm also went numb during this. She went to the eye doctor and he diagnosed her with amarousis fugax, and immediately referred her to a cardiologist to get an ultrasound of her left carotid artery.

My mom also has a recent history of some chest pains that extend down her left arm. She also was diagnosed with mitrovalve prolapse years back, but doctors here are saying her heart imagery shows no evidence of that.

The cardiologist told her the tests were too expensive since she doesn't have insurance, but this ultimately won't be an issue since we are blessed to have a family member that has agreed to paying for all of my mother's medical expenses.

The cardiologist advised my mother to call around to all the local hospitals and get the best price quotes before he would order her tests. He urged her that it was important she do this A.S.A.P.

Well, due to COVID my mom was unsuccessful in getting callbacks about pricing.

So, on Wednesday at 11:00 at night my mom yawned and had a severe debilitating pain in her left jaw/left neck area. We know that is a symptom of heart attack in women so we rushed to the ER.
 

The ER got her a room. So far she has had a CT scan, an echocardiogram with a bubble study, but still has not had the carotid artety ultrasound.

The cardiologist said she has a blockage in her heart (calcium), her LDL cholesterol is 164, and her heart rate has been consistently high (100-114). Her heart rate has been like that all her life, though. She also has high blood pressure.

Since she has been admitted to the hospital, though, she has received a beta-blocker for her heart rate and blood pressure, lipitor for her cholestrol, and a blood thinner. Her blood pressure is now steadily about 120/77 and heart rate 71 bpm. She also was on birth control pills for hot flashes, but quit them after her TIA after learning about blood clotting  risks.

So our cardiologist has TERRIBLE bedside manor with my mother. He was recommended to her by my grandparents, who he is apparently very doting and nasty nice with, but he has been horrible to my mother. 

She has been in the hospital for four days and hasn't visited her once. He acts insulted when she asks basic questions anyone would ask about the procedure and her condition. In fact, he told her ""you sound uncomfortable so maybe you should get a second opinion"" just because she asked where her blockage was. We still don't know what are of the heart her blockage is in. He also laughed in her face when she asked how often he places stents and said ""I've only done it twice."" He clarified his sarcasm, but his attitude has not been nice at all and he keeps scaring us by repeating the risk of death from the procedure, etc.

The cardiologist also said he was not sure that her blockage is in a place where the stent will be able to be reached in there and she may end up needing open heart surgery by a different physician.

I wonder what is thie cardiologist's deal? What's with the attitude? We have been nothing but kind and respectful. Perhaps he is kind to my grandparents because they have insurance and we don't? He seems very concerned with pricing.

**Anyway this is the URGENT ISSUE:**

He wants to give my mom a heart catherization surgery Monday and likely place a stent in there. But, I wonder if this is necessary? She hasn't even had her carotid ultrasound yet. He hasn't even visited her in person yet.

If it weren't for COVID I would send my mom to get a second opinion immediately before getting this surgery. But I am afraid they won't take her at another hospital because of COVID, and she is currently in a room at her current hospital.

Please I don't want my mom to have this risky and invasive surgery if unnecessary. 

Her cardiologist repeatedly says ""carotid is not my specialty because it deals with the brain.""

Please help your advice could be saving my mother's life.",2,11,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hh00mk/should_my_mom_get_a_heart_stent_i_need_immediate/"")",2020-06-27 12:41:40,Physician Responded
hh0nx7,25M White areas appearing under eyes,"Hi all, I'm a 25 year old male, 5'8"", 142 lbs, and for about a year now I've noticed that I have these whitish spots forming under my eyes:

[https://imgur.com/a/Yr3RuSW](https://imgur.com/a/Yr3RuSW)

One day my girlfriend just suddenly noticed them. I always wear glasses so no body ever really notices them- you have to get pretty close to my face to see it. However, even though it's been a year, it doesn't seem to be getting any worse (the spots aren't getting whiter, and the area doesn't seem to be growing over time). 

Some background info:

* I don't have any serious medical conditions - I do suffer from frequent migraines though, at least once per week I get them on average. 
* My lifestyle is pretty sedentary, but I try to get some exercise in- I have a punching bag downstairs that I practice martial arts on, and I lift some dumbbells and do push ups and other body weight exercises from time to time because it makes me feel good- no real exercise goals in mind.  But I definitely don't get a lot of sun. 
* I try to drink a lot of water every day- I only drink soda  and eat sweets on weekends, though I may over indulge because of my sweet tooth. I don't ever drink alcohol. 
* My job requires me to look at a computer all day- but I get up and walk around away from the computer every two hours or so. 
* My sleep schedule probably isn't what it should be, but nothing too extreme. On average I get probably 6-7 hours of sleep every night. On the weekends I probably sleep way too much, ranging from 9-12 hours Fri/Sat nights.  

So please advise if you have any ideas about this- it's really hard to find info about this just by Googling it. Thank you!",2,5,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hh0nx7/25m_white_areas_appearing_under_eyes/"")",2020-06-27 13:17:38,Physician Responded
hh0odo,Please help! Long term issues with periods neglected by doctors.,"Hello! I am a 22 year old female and I was put on the pill by my doctor when I was 14 because of really painful, irregular periods(i would lose consciousness because of too much pain, over the counter pain killers did not work even the slightest). The pills sort of improved my condition, my periods became regular and the pain was more manageable. I took them for 3 years with no interruption, took a 6 months break as my doctor recommended (i guess in order to see if i still had the same issues after the effects from the pill cleared out), but had to go on them again for the same reason. Fast forward to when I was 19, i started to feel as if the pills had less and less of a beneficial effect. I started to get pain in my pelvic area when i was ovulating, which didn’t happen before, my periods got more and more painful, i started to get small cysts in my breasts around my period, which were also painful. By this time I had moved to the UK and, one one occasion, the cysts were so painful I literally couldn’t sleep, i would tear up whenever something touched my breasts. I visited my GP, i explained the whole situation and medical history and all they did was schedule me an appointment (for two weeks later) with a breast clinic that would suck out the cysts (this is what my gp told me). She was not worried about my pelvic pain or any other symptoms. I explained that the cysts would go away on their own (they always do) but that i need either something to numb the pain when they appeared or further examinations to find out the cause of this, so i declined the appointment. She didn’t refer me to another specialist, did not offer any other alternatives and made me feel as if i was crazy. I soon visited a sex health clinic, and they changed my birth control pills. For the record, the ones I was on before were called Logest, they are from Romania and aren’t available in the UK, hence the change, not because they weren’t doing their job. Immediately after I changed pills, I started to gain weight, feeling all swollen, my ovaries and uterus would now hurt all the time, regardless of when in my menstrual cycle I was, breast cysts occurred more often and more painful. So I stopped taking them. I ended up going to the emergency room once when i got my period because the pain was so bad i couldn’t do anything but ball up and cry. I was sent home without any medication for the pain and was told to keep taking over the counter painkillers (i make it very clear to every doctor i go to that these just do not work). Now every period is a nightmare, my mental state is incredibly fragile, i get mood swings so bad that one second i’m having a complete melt down, the next i’m on the floor laughing. I also started to get sharp pains from my vagina travelling through my abdomen, terrible migraines, nausea, dizziness, cramps, lower back pain. The weight I put on when I switched pills does not go away, regardless of how many diets or work out plans i try. I can’t even go to work when i get my period. I just can’t stand it anymore, the quality of my life has gone down the hill and I have no idea what to do. Doctors here seem to dismiss my issues and think i am just exaggerating, i can’t afford to go to a private clinic so i don’t know what other solutions i might have. I changed GPs three times since i moved to the UK and it is the exact same thing with each of them.
Regarding medical examinations, the first time i was put on the pill, the doctor did not do any tests or even an ultrasound, my mom basically described what was going on and he just wrote the prescription. No doctor was ever interested in finding the cause of these issues, the most I got was basic blood work which always comes back good and some ultrasounds which show nothing wrong. Are there any more ‘in depth’ examinations or tests I can ask for? What is going on with my body and how can I fix it? I am 22, i can’t live my life like this until menopause, I’ll go insane.

At my first adult physical 6 months ago (haven’t had a physical with a GP in over 5 years prior to this), blood work showed slightly elevated AST/ALT levels.

The last round of tests showed normal AST/ALT. I don’t drink much alcohol and my only risk factor for fatty liver is elevated blood pressure, which I was put on medication for at the same physical that started all this.

Throughout the day, it turned red and started to appear rash-like. The symptoms persisted throughout the week, and now it's Saturday, and nothing has changed. Here are a couple pics:

hh22sd,(20M)I want to use marijuana but am worried about lung cancer.,"So basically I live in a state where marijuana is now legalized for recreational use (CO). I am currently in college for my masters degree. (young, i know)

So basically I had zero interest in drugs of any sort all throughout my life until one of my friends who is also a musician (Im a professional guitarist and songwriter outside of school) introduced my to marijuana. I believed that marijuana was an evil horrible drug from hell but I realized that here was a guy who uses it, albeit moderately, and is an up and coming jazz sax player in one of the biggest cities in the US. I couldn't believe it. 

My life entire I have suffered from crohns disease. It has progressively gotten worse over the course of my life and I struggle to manage my symptoms and balance my busy life. I knew people used marijuana to combat chronic inflammatory conditions so.....

I tried it. And it gave me my life back. No Joke. 

I only use about twice a month. Nothing crazy either just one joint when i do. It has literally, and I mean this in no uncertain terms, given me my life back. My relationships have improved, my crohns has gone into remission, my guitar practice and songwriting is more focused. I feel more connected to the world. Its incredible, its like magic. 

But Im so terrified of getting cancer from it. As someone who knows what grave illness feels like I value my health above all else. I want to continue to use marijuana and I cant=;t bring myself to continue to do something that causes cancer. I understand this is basically a trade off but I still don't know what to do. 

I know smoking isn't the only way to consume but other methods don't seem to be as effective for my Crohns symptoms.",2,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hh22sd/20mi_want_to_use_marijuana_but_am_worried_about/"")",2020-06-27 14:38:01,Physician Responded

Now that I’m not working (Cuz COVID) I cannot seem to sleep. I am writing this at 8am after not sleeping at all last night and getting about 6 or less hours the previous night. 
When I sleep, I CONSTANTLY wake up, no matter what. Been waking up up to 6 times in a night, and when I wake up, even after 2 hours of sleep, I wake up feeling fully awake. I cannot seem to fall asleep until extremely late into the night and I even got strong sleeping tablets to help me, and they didn’t help in the slightest. They would either have no effect whatsoever, or the drowsiness would continue the following day and I would just sleep the whole day and feel horrible. 
Because of how bad my sleep is, I am CONSTANTLY tired. I cannot motivation myself to do anything because of how tired I am all the time and my eyes are constantly feeling heavy and I keep having to consistently blink. 
The most troubling part of it is just how my eyes are constantly irritated and how they constantly feel heavy and I feel like I’m blinking my eyes dry. 

I also have gotten eye drops to try help with my eyes but didn’t help.

hh5nzm,Neonatal death and dx of Chorioamnionitis,"30f, slightly overweight, history of early miscarriage at 6 weeks, 6 weeks, and 9 weeks prior to neonatal death

Throughout the pregnancy I bled on and off. My doctor diagnosed it as possible partial placental abruption because he couldn’t find another reason for the bleeding. I made it to 23 and a half weeks before I started having contractions. I was given a round of IV magnesium drip, and then a round of indocin. The two medications helped get me to 24 weeks. 

At 24 weeks and 1 day my water broke and labor progressed quickly. The neonatal doctors tried to save my daughter, but for the first 9 minutes they couldn’t get her breathing. They later told us that she had a glob of green mucus blocking her airway. We were told there was nothing more they could do and that she was very sick. They offered to keep trying but told us that her prognosis was poor. 

I was later told that I had Chorioamnionitis and it was likely that bacteria entered my womb through the spot where my placenta kept pulling away and causing the bleed.

My questions:

I hate myself for not telling the doctors to keep working on my daughter. They told me it was likely that after 9 minutes without oxygen she would have sever brain damage, but I still feel like I made the wrong choice. Did I? 

Could this have been diagnosed sooner? I complained of uterus pain for about a month before I went into labor.

hh66qx,"Pleural effusion after abdominal surgery, how long should it take to resolve?","Age/sex: 40F
Height/weight: 165cm, 120kg

TLDR:  Had laparoscopic bowel resection a month ago, readmitted for pleural effusion three weeks ago. Thoracentesis done, but recent x-ray shows a moderate effusion still present. How long should this take to resolve? 

Background: I have had Crohn’s disease since 2008, with a previous ileocecal resection in 2010. I had been asymptomatic for several years, but followed up with my GI doc in Dec 2019. A colonoscopy showed a stricture in the terminal ileum, and I was started on Entyvio IV infusion monthly. I had previously taken Entyvio a couple years ago and it was quite effective, but had to stop for a while due to insurance issues and then I procrastinated restarting it as I was feeling well (not a good idea, I know). I was admitted to hospital in Jan 2020 with a partial small bowel obstruction, and was on prednisone for eight weeks. 

I had increasing pain in May, and about a month ago I had a laparoscopic resection of the stricture (about 14cm of ileum removed). They said the surgery took longer, was more difficult and required more ports (5), due to my previous surgery and scar tissue. I was recovering well at first, but on post-op day two I developed a fever. Sputum and blood cultures were negative, and WBCs were normal. Chest x-ray, chest CT and abdominal CT were clear, and the abdominal incisions looked good. Tests for covid and influenza were negative. I was on IV antibiotics for several days, but discharged without them as they said all the tests had been negative for infection. I was given a discharge prescription of PRN Tramacet for pain, and PRN Zofran for nausea. 

I returned to hospital after two days (about three weeks ago) due to fever (38.5C) and increasing shortness of breath and high heart rate (RR 30, HR 110-140 at rest).  Chest x-ray showed a right side pleural effusion filling about half the lung. Chest x-ray and chest CT did not show any pneumonia. Thoracentesis was done and drained about 750ml reddish fluid. I just had a small dressing after (no chest tube needed). The fluid was tested - I don’t know all the results but they said it was an exudative effusion. V/Q scan was negative for pulmonary embolism. Covid and influenza tests were repeated, and were negative again. They gave me IV antibiotics as a precaution, and when I was discharged the day after the thoracentesis they gave me oral Amoxiclav for ten days. They said the effusion was possibly para-pneumonic, but was most likely a reactive effusion related to my recent abdominal surgery. They said if it’s a reactive effusion it would be unlikely to return (reaccumulate? not sure of the right terminology). 

Current situation:  I followed up with my family doctor a week and a half ago. Chest x-ray showed a “moderate” size right pleural effusion, and bloodwork was normal (CBC with differential). Another chest x-ray a week later (a couple days ago) showed almost no change.  

I currently feel ok at rest, but my resting heart rate is 90-105 (normally it’s about 70-75).  At home I have a finger pulse oximeter and I’m usually at 94-97%. But with any activity (eg, taking a shower, walking around my apartment) I get some shortness of breath and my heart rate is 110-120.  Walking out to my parking lot or around a grocery store I get increased shortness of breath.  I also get pain in the lower ribs on the front if I take a deep breath/cough/sneeze, and pain in my right shoulder/neck which my Dr says is likely referred pain due to the effusion irritating the diaphragm.  The shoulder pain sometimes makes it difficult to sleep. I’ve also been having a moderate amount of fatigue during the day, general lack of energy. Occasionally I feel a little dizzy, especially after walking a longer distance (eg. shopping at Costco).  

My family doctor said that we’ll just keep monitoring the effusion, and they wouldn’t drain it again unless it was causing more severe shortness of breath or decreased pulse ox.  I asked how long it might take for the effusion to clear up on its own but she didn’t know. We’re going to do another chest X-ray in two weeks. 

My recovery from my abdominal surgery looks good. Incisions (scope sites x5 and a small midline infusion) look like they’re healing well. No abdominal pain.

I’m currently off work on short-term disability, as I work part-time in a group home for clients with disabilities who need a lot of personal care. I’m also a nursing student, and I’m supposed to have a hospital clinical placement in August. I feel ok when I’m resting at home, but my shortness of breath with normal daily activity and short walks may not allow me to return to work and school until it improves. I really don’t want to delay my school program if at all possible, and my short term disability isn’t enough to pay my monthly bills (using savings now, may have to borrow from family). 

Current meds:  Entyvio IV infusion monthly (on hold since pre-op, will resume after pleural effusion resolves), Wellbutrin XL 150mg twice daily, iron supplement, vitamin B12, vitamin D

Questions:  How long does it normally take for a pleural effusion to resolve on its own?  If the effusion hasn’t cleared up in a couple weeks, should I ask my doctor for more aggressive treatment than “wait and see”?  Should I get a referral to a pulmonologist, or is this something a family doctor can monitor ok?

hh6v76,Extreme sensitivity to heat [M18],"I'm 5' 7"", 135 pounds, in great shape, and very athletically involved. 

For my entire life, I've been incredibly sensitive to any heat greater than around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. When faced with any heat exceeding that level, I am prone to anxiety, intense muscle fatigue, skin irritation, and what I believe is a slight cognitive decline. On the flipside, I have a significantly greater tolerance for the cold than the rest of my peers. I feel most comfortable wearing a t-shirt and shorts in mid 50s degree weather, and experience heat flashes when wearing anything more in anything hotter. 

I've gone through my life affectionately (?) labeled by friends parents as the ""boy who never needs a jacket,"" which makes me feel like somewhat of an outsider but it hasn't been a big deal, until recently. Last week, two of my friends, their families, and I got tested for Covid (all came back negative), then traveled north about 3 hours to a cabin in a relatively secluded woodland area.

We live in a city that is normally in the high 50s/low 60s, and our destination was around low to mid 80s every day. While there, I experienced horrible skin irritation on my arms, mental and physical fatigue, and two panic attacks that I had never in my life experienced before. These included difficulty breathing, feelings of impending doom, and immense guilt. Luckily, the moms of my two friends were very understanding and helped me calm down, but I feel like I was a burden on them during the trip as a result. I got back to the city today, and after feeling weird and uncomfortable for a few more hours, I regained my normal self that I had not felt throughout the whole week.

This experience has led me to believe that my temperature tolerance could go beyond my body having unique preferences, and could possibly have medical implications. Are there any deficiencies that align with my symptoms, and are there any steps to be taken to alleviate them?

i know that sweating is a pretty normal part of being a teenager, but i'm pretty sure most of my peers can wear non-sleeveless shirts with no issues. i had an eating disorder and was extremely underweight from the ages of 11 to 16, went through treatment when i was 16, and am now at a healthy weight. the sweating started shortly after i went through treatment, and i never had any issue with it before, so it might be related to that. i would think that maybe my puberty was delayed due to being severely underweight, but i experienced normal onset of menstruation, development of secondary sex characteristics, etc. when i was 11-12 so that wouldn't make much sense.

i'm 5'2"", 115 lbs and white/latina. i don't drink, smoke, or use drugs, but i am on 100mg zoloft daily for anxiety/depression, as well as birth control, and 5mg dextroamphetamine for ADHD as needed. i have noticed that the sweating gets worse when i have taken my adhd medication, but it persists even on days when i don't need to take it. frankly, i would just like to be able to stop wearing tank tops all the time, and get back to having a normal wardrobe and not needing to literally mop up my own sweat every ten minutes. any advice would be appreciated!",1,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hh7rr7/18f_with_excessive_sweating_that_has_not/"")",2020-06-27 20:50:17,Physician Responded

hh9237,3F Swallowed Ball of Floss,"Patient details: 3 year old female; 3 feet tall; 26 lbs; no medications; no medical problems; non-smoker; accidental swallowing.

4-5 months ago, our 3yo daughter wanted to floss her teeth, so partner gave her what he said was 6-9 inches of floss. He continued to floss his teeth, and while doing so, saw her ball the floss up. She then put it in her mouth and swallowed it.

We called poison control and the nurse line; they both said it's non-toxic and that it will come out in her poop, and there is a small risk of it getting tangled in her insides. But mostly they said to watch for it in her poop and, to be on the safe side, to call our regular pediatrician on Monday to get his input.

But we never saw it in her poop. We didn't go through her poop at all, but it was not obvious that it came out, if it did. I really wish I would have been more firm about actually looking at her poop. Alas, I was not. Anyway...

She hasn't shown any problems or anything, I'm just thinking about it more lately. I'll be calling our ped on Monday (for whatever reason, I guess because I just wasn't that worried after a couple days, I didn't call our ped when it had happened).

I mainly have three questions:

1. If it's still inside her, how likely is it that it'll get tangled and cause serious problems?

2. If it's still inside her, does the plastic it's made of pose any risk to her body? It seems like it'd be not good for plastic to just be sitting around the insides. Could it contribute to cancer or anything else that serious?

3. How can we find out if it is still inside her or not? I've read that many plastics are radiolucent, i.e. they don't show up on x-rays.

hh9bmg,Should I be concerned with my high heart rate,"26 female, 99 lbs, 5'1 
Hello there, I don't  know if it's something  worth bringing  up with  my new doctor  or not but I have had lots of chest pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness, and palpations. I brought those up to my doctor  once and she ran an EKG. She noticed that I had sinus tachycardia but wasn't too concerned due to the fact that I'm a young adult. My father has tachycardia and had to get a surgery for it. I didn't  think much of it and thought my fatigue and dizziness was due to my scoliosis and other chronic illnesses. Until I got a smart watch and kept getting warnings that my heart rate was high. My average daily heart rate is 90+ and It goes above 100 on an hourly basis. I have had the smart watches for 2 years and even in clinical/er visits my heart rate is always high. I noticed that my vision goes completely dark when I stand up too fast, I have palpations when I do any physical activities even if it's  just walking for too long, I have hard times with showers and my heart rate is 120+ when I shower after I finish I have to sit down for a bit and drink water, I have also noticed that I can't go up or down the stairs without being breathless and feeling like my heart wants to burst. My heart rate spikes when I sit up and stand up but I also get 100+ readings while I'm asleep. I'm a ballerina so I'm active but it's  extremely exhausting to keep up with my lifestyle. I have scoliosis, osteoarthritis, and migraines. I have chronic pain so I take 650 mg Tylenol and ibuprofen quite often and take muscle relaxant.

hhho0h,Birthday candles?,"My spouse and I may have made a mistake. My parents came up to visit after months of not seeing each other. One parent works in a hospital with COVID patients, and while doesn't generally work with them daily, it has occurred. No positive COVID test from either of them, and my spouse and I tested negative a few weeks back. We both work from home, rarely go out.
Well after avoiding for months, we held a birthday celebration with them. Just the four of us. Social distancing, masks, outside, washing hands, etc.
But we may have screwed up. One parent, the one working in the hospital, was to blow out the candles on the cake, **and it completely failed to cross our mind this whole endeavor was a bad idea** and we proceeded to eat the cake.

We are sitting here the next morning, thinking about how bad of an idea that likely was. We've seen a few stories about bacteria transfer from blowing out candles (some 2017 study) and general recommendations to not blow out candles in the age of COVID, but nothing clear about whether we should be immediately concerned and go back to quarantining. That COVID doesn't seem to transfer through food (though blowing out candles I suppose could have blown on the cake plate too, and we avoided being in the path of the blowing)

So, to review, very careful otherwise, parent works in healthcare setting with COVID patients occasionally, no positive test from anyone, damage is done re: eating the cake.

hhi2ck,[Serious] How to cure/control phobia of farting (flatuphobia) ?,"I am 25 years male. I have been having digestive problem for 7 years and consulted different doctors. None of the medication worked.

My problems are:

1 - Farting in public without any control.

2 - Having an urgent urge to use toilet or else keep           farting.

I have guessed that i have flatuphobia by myself and not by any doctor.

My reasons:

1 - If i am around someone who is going to judge harshly for bad smell, i become concious about smell, i starting thinking about controlling my fart, which results in me farting and have an urge to use toilet. This urge doesn't go away till i use toilet and i continue farting till i use toilet.

2 - If i feel some sensation on my belly then if i start thinking about not farting, this result in me farting until i use the toilet.

3 - If i am around someone who is not going to be react negatively on smell, i dont become concious about smell and have a normal time with them.

Long version: haven’t had a “normal” doctors appointment since I was 18 about to go to college.

That being said I turned 30 this year and I know I need to start being better about this stuff and overcoming my fears.

I do go to the dermatologist once or twice a year due to being high risk and the eye doctor as I gotta keep that contact prescription up to date.

What other doctors appointments do I need to be doing? Is primary care enough? Should I see an obgyn as well what’s the difference? Any other appointments I should look to make? What should I expect at those visits?

I assume I’ll have to get blood work done being that it will be a new doctor and it’s been so long. What about vaccines? Any advice on getting over those fears?

hhiau9,Nausea / weakness when exercising in mornings?,"I am a 26 M/5'5/130 lb who has difficulty with nausea and weakness in the mornings. It's way more convenient to exercise in the morning time wise, but the problem is that I often end up feeling very weak and dry heave when I do harder efforts. It seems like it's linked to hunger: If I eat, drink enough water, and wait roughly 90 minutes, sometimes add some caffeine, I start to feel ""normal."" Before that, my stomach feels bad and I also get this slight headache and this feeling of just wanting to lie down.


This didn't always use to happen; in high school and early college, I do remember needing to eat a little bit before I would exercise in the mornings, but usually not the level of fatigue or nausea I do now. This has started happening for the last ~3 years roughly. I've asked a doctor generally about this and they seemed to have no idea, other than suggesting to take some anti acid medications (would help with nausea, but I imagine I'd still feel weak). Based on the symptoms, I'm wondering if I'm just waking up with low blood sugar levels, as I have a family history of diabetes and I've historically generally described myself as feeling weak if I was too hungry.

I haven't noticed a particular pattern with regard to what I ate the night before. I generally eat rice or pasta for most of my meals. The only suspect thing I can think of is that I often eat my dinner pretty late - 8 or 9 PM, being in bed at around 11. I'm wondering if there's a connection between a too-late dinner and waking up with these symptoms. 

A lot of people I talk to say they can go running, etc. in the morning without too many issues. I'd like to feel like that but I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Or if it's just certain genetic predispositions that make me not good at morning exercising.",1,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hhiau9/nausea_weakness_when_exercising_in_mornings/"")",2020-06-28 10:20:50,Physician Responded

hhkp81,Returning with questions about the ominous mouth ulcer...help!,"20F, African-American. No medications. 

Hi, overly anxious patient here. So, I’ve posted here once about a supposed black ‘ring of death’ on my inner cheek, and was diagnosed to have a traumatic mouth ulcer (probably from eating some super hot eggs). Give it two weeks, and it’ll be gone. 

In celebrating that two weeks, I am here to say that the ulcer has decided on extending its stay, and honestly seems as though it’s getting bigger. That could be my imagination though. If it has gotten bigger, it’s wasn’t an overwhelmingly noticeable change. 

Same symptoms, no pain, just that metallic taste when I lick at it. Slight texture on the edges. 

I’ve pretty much counted out it being some form of HSV, seeing as it doesn’t look (or feel) as such, but I’m still putting off acts of passion at the moment. Would hate for it to grow into something (it doesn’t make sense, I know).

My question is more about etiquette than about actual treatment. I have never been to the doctor for a particularly sensitive issue before, but now I’m having pain in my pubic region and it’s gone on long enough that I need to see a doctor. I recently changed providers and I found a place that’s accepting new patients, and was recommended to me by some friends.

I called them and got the first available appointment, and the first doctor available was a male doctor. It turns out that doctor’s reviews aren’t as great, but the doctor who the practice is named after is a woman. Let’s say the place is called “the Shelby Clinic” … Dr. Shelby is a woman, and every review says she provides really good care.

Because of the nature of my complaint, would it be weird if I asked them to schedule me with Dr. Shelby? I promise I’m not getting any kind of weird kick out of this, but they might think it’s weird that I’m requesting specifically to see her, when I was already assigned to a male provider.

She was recently hospitalized (but is home now) for a fractured vertebrae. An MRI discovered a mass in her lung which was biopsied and found to be Stage 4 Lung Adenocarcinoma. Other than this she has a history of a leaky heart valve for the last 3 years (driving overall lethargy) and thyroid problems for which she takes medication.

hhq0wz,Should I press my doctor for an iron infusion?,"Hello medical community, this is my first time posting here. I would like to know if I should pressure my doctor to let me get an iron infusion?

Details: Age: 23, Gender: Female, Height: 5'3??? Weight: 135 pounds, Race: White. 

Some background on me: I've been anemic since I was 13 years old (had 3 seizures at that age which led to multiple medical tests, and a blood tests revealed I was anemic. I am not epileptic, it was a one-time thing and I have not had one since). At the time (in 2009) my parents were not concerned about the anemia (and I was a child so I didn't argue) but my anemia never got better and to this day, I am still considered anemic. I'm currently on iron pills which I take once-a-day with Vitamin C. 

I found out 4 months ago that I have Celiac Disease through a blood test. This was a shock, as we didn't know anyone in our family with the disease. I got the results RIGHT BEFORE the pandemic so things shut down and I was not able to go for a biopsy. I've been living gluten-free for the last 4 months now (as my doctor thinks the Celiac is the main cause of my anemia and didn't want to cause more damage to my body by continuing to eat gluten with no-test in sight). I got a blood-test back this week and my Hemoglobin was 114 g/L and my Ferritin was &lt;1 ug/L so still very low. 

My doctor said he couldn't get me an iron infusion 4 months ago due to the pandemic BUT if he could HE ABSOLUTELY WOULD. (Since my numbers were similar 4 months ago) and now that a lot of time has passed and my numbers ARE STILL LOW, I'm worried he's going to say ""let's wait 3 more months"" and I simply do not want to... I'm tired and achey every day, and I have issues taking the pills, because they upset my stomach and psychologically swallowing pills just freaks me out (you'd think I'd get used to it over 10 years time, but NO it still upsets me to take them) so I really want an infusion. 

But I just honestly want to know, do my numbers warrant an infusion, based on my situation/history?",0,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hhq0wz/should_i_press_my_doctor_for_an_iron_infusion/"")",2020-06-28 17:42:32,Physician Responded

hhqi6s,Bleach for groin folliculitis?,"Age: 27

Sex: Male

Issue: Last month or two on groin? Several months on my other known issues portion. 

Other known issues: KP on arms, bone aches occasional( but daily in some regard), forcdye spots upper lip/ penile area, bruising type spots on the penile area that cause occasional dull pain( but daily in some regard). Thought to point this out in case they at any point could correlate to this post, otherwise please only see below. 

So I can’t be on my antibiotics anymore, mainly due to fear of it reversing my Accutane experience ( on face ), the recent headaches, and also the rest of my folliculitis is gone( was gone in less than a week of using drugs, and it’s NOT chronic ). I’m not even sure if what is on my groin is that or just really persistent razor nicks that aren’t even bacterial. If it were I’m thinking a combination of antibiotics, antiseptic ( Hibiclens), 10% BP wash, and mupirocin would do it. I’ve heard of people using diluted bleach to kill off anything that could be fungal/bacterial? Is this a bad idea in that area ( obviously with the notion of using a Vaseline grade barrier in sensitive areas and a cotton tip to apply applications).

To clarify, I'm on doxycycline MAINLY because I over shaved in my groin area and caused this to happen. So this is very recent, but persistent nonetheless. The doctor recommended I take 100mg 2x/day for 3 months, and in the last month, it's 100mg/day. I'm thinking no way can that happen especially after what Accutane does to the gut, and all the limitations antibiotics put you on. In terms of other POSSIBLE folliculitis areas, my buttocks and legs had a few spots that cleared up in the first week with no new spots. This is why i'm definitely thinking it's bacterial IF ANYTHING at all. I saw on a Reddit post where someone used bleach to cure it on their head, and there's also bleach baths people use to cure it everywhere else( excluding head of course). Would this be advisable for me? Before people say"" you should check with your doctor "" or "" get it swabbed"" that cost money and if you knew the cost I've put in in just the last half year you wouldn't do that either. I'm just looking for an expert opinion on if this is a good idea or not?

I've been feeling low and anxious for the last 3 weeks already. I've been experiencing loss of appetite, sudden rapid heart rate, and I have trouble sleeping at night. This all started when one of my senior workmate verbally abuses me. Our conflict started when Mr. E (I'll just call him Mr.E) strongly disapproved of my observance of the  fourteen days home-quarantine despite the fact that the chief of the Radiology Department has already approved of it, I am a Radiologic Technologist.  

This matter escalated out of hand since Mr. E has accused me of malingering, he questioned the assessment of our very own Doctor as to why I was approved for home-quarantine because according to his own judgment: I am healthy and should proceed to be the radtech covid responder and need not to undergo quarantine despite suffering from sore throat, cough, colds, and fever.

I can no longer tolerate Mr. E's humiliation in the presence of my colleagues and inappropriate remarks towards me and even demanded our Chief to not let me avail the covid leave to exhaust all my leave credits. This has been a cycle for the 3 weeks which has taken a toll on my well being as an individual. As a consequence of experiencing this maltreatment, I am suffering from anxiety attacks hours prior to my scheduled duty. I lost the will to go to work. I have tried not to be bothered over this matter and let this pass quietly but my body is reacting differently. I think because Mr. E has crossed the line for displaying such disturbing behaviour in front of our colleagues repeatedly. I've been having this worse headaches. I'm very irritable. I want to cry but I cannot cry. I don't know what to do. As a victim of sexual harassment during my internship, I feel like I am reliving those moments, the difference now is I am verbally abused and humiliated.

hhscat,Colon cancer? Parasite? Help.,"Hey, I’m 19year old male. I’ve been having the worst stomach issues of my life the past 6 months and they continuously get worse. I’m scheduled for a colonoscopy in 2 weeks but I am concerned because it’s just getting terrible. 

My symptoms:
-I always feel like I have to go poop, even after I poop
-there is a pressure on my butt always like I have to poop
-I’m always bloated
-I’m always nauseas 

The main uncomfortable aspect of this is I always feel like I need to go poop. It’s hell. I don’t even sleep anymore. Maybe it’s rectal spasms. Hell, there is so many things it can be on the internet. 


I feel so bad I want to go to the hopsital. But I don’t think they can do much more than the colonoscopy and coronavirus is a risk.

hhshrj,Constantly exhausted,"I am 37/f, 5’ 4”, 125 lbs.  I am in relatively good shape and have had this issue since adolescence. I don’t take any medications and don’t have any diagnosed diseases, but my mother has lupus. I eat a pretty healthy diet, not a lot of sugar (I don’t like sweets) and no junk or fast food or soda, and only lightly drink on social occasions (1 or 2 glasses of wine at most), and usually get around 7 hours of sleep a night (if I get fewer than 6 hours I cannot even function). I also walk for about 20-30 minutes a day with my dog - this does make me tired but not so much that it ruins the whole next day.

Since about my teens I have been tired all the time. Usually I can just push through it or take a nap if I’m not doing anything other than work and house chores etc, but if I need to do something that involves leaving the house for more than an hour, I will be wiped out for the whole next day. I mean wiped out, cranky, sore and exhausted. The first time I really noticed this and realized it wasn’t normal was when I was about 23 and went to check out my friend’s barn. I didn’t even ride, just hung out and looked at her horses and watched someone else ride for a couple of hours. When I got home, I fell right into bed and basically was useless for the next 36 hours. Completely exhausted. 
Yesterday, I went to visit my brother’s house (he has a small farm) and we went on a little nature walk as we’re in the PNW and he has some nice woods around his property. I was there for several hours, but I really did not do anything too strenuous. Today, my whole body is achy, I’m extremely snappy and short (I can tell I am, but just cannot help it) and just have absolutely no energy at all. 
Even grocery shopping is physically difficult and really tiring. 
I have had a thyroid panel done and it came back normal, so I’m not really sure what’s going on or how to fix it but it’s incredibly frustrating and interferes with my ability to live a normal life. Does anyone have any idea what could be going on or what I can do to fix this?",1,8,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hhshrj/constantly_exhausted/"")",2020-06-28 20:30:09,Physician Responded

hhsrlr,How do I force myself to eat when I'm depressed?,"I'll start off by saying I'm 19M, Korean, 5'6 and 115 pounds.

Anyways, I've always had a lot of trouble forcing myself to eat food when I'm stressed or sad. If I'm stressed enough (like before my school's finals) sometimes I'll go a whole day or more without feeling the desire to eat anything and I'll feel physically fine, not shaky or faint, but my mood is always really bad when I don't eat. I always feel much happier a few minutes after I finish a meal. The worst it ever got was a few weeks before I left for college, I was feeling scared, stressed, and afraid, and I spent 2 weeks barely eating. I was lucky if I ate one meal a day and I thought about going to a therapist during that time but I never ended up doing it.

I've had this problem for my whole life and I've always thought it was like how so many people eat to comfort themselves, except the exact opposite. I started smoking marijuana about 2 years ago and that's really helped jumpstart my appetite when I'm feeling down, but lately it hasn't been as effective.  

The problem is that it's really hard to force myself to eat, I have to consciously chew every bite and no matter how good something is it doesn't seem to matter. I'm a healthy weight and I don't have any eating disorders or mental health issues (that I know of), does anyone have any advice or similar experiences?

I hope this is the right sub for this but for almost half a year now I've had this rash or skin condition that doesnt seem to be going away.
It started on my toes and then I later noticed it appear on my leg and top of my right foot.
It doesnt hurt at all the only problem with it is it itches like hell, like a ridiculous amount. Not all the time, it seems to crop up randomly but a lot of the time when I am getting in bed and going sleep.

Any advise or if anyone knows what this is and how to treat it would be great.

hi1ls5,"29M is this lice, dandruff, or something else?","29 male, 195lbs, 6'0""
I take Lamotrigine daily for the past two months and occasionally take Tizanidine. I smoke medical marijuana, but never cigarettes. I drink alcohol very rarely. This issue has been happening for years, much longer than I've been on any current medications. 

First off, I know the real answer to this 
question is to see a dermatologist. It's difficult for me to do that with my current work schedul so I just want some opinions about this for now, and I'll followup soon. 

If I scratch my scalp, I often feel little things get under my fingernails. They look white or slightly yellowish. They're roughly pill shaped, soft, and can be squished or reshaped slightly if you roll them between your fingers. I can typically find several of them on my head at various points. They come off under my fingernails pretty easily. If they're attached to the hair strands at all, they don't seem to stay that way. More likely it seems they're on my scalp. They are slightly pointed, I can feel them poking my finger as I scrape my scalp with my nails and I can feel them coming off. Some are a little harder than others, taking two or three scrapes before coming off instead of one. 

Pictures of one such thing on my finger, pardon the bad quality it's hard to photograph stuff this small with my phone https://imgur.com/a/cSzmKvS

I had lice 2-3 separate times as a kid. One of those times was really bad, with large (for lice. I'm not even sure if those were lice or something else at the time) insects that were dead and stuck in my (at the time) long hair. These days I buzz my hair almost as short as it goes. I typically see no dandruff (I've never had it as far as I know) and my scalp rarely itches. 

There are times, randomly, where I'll feel like something might be crawling on my scalp, but if I ever scratch or brush that area, these things normally come out. That feeling tends to be in a single spot at a time. I asked my mom to check my hair a while back when this happened and she saw nothing that resembled lice or lice eggs (she cleaned my lice all previous times that I had it). 

The stuff that gets under my nails reminds me of what comes out of a blackhead, but in smaller amounts and maybe a tad bit more solid than that. I can feel them get picked up off my skin, I normally know when I'm scratching one out before I look at my fingers. I sometimes get the same thing behind me ears, on the skin and not hair. 

My initial thought is that they're tiny zits and what's getting under my nails is puss or something. But with some of the other factors mixed in, it seems kind of strange. They do not hurt like zits nor do they really feel like the kind of zits I can on my face. when I scratch them away, it doesn't feel like something has popped, it feels like something that was stuck to my head just came loose. I've looked up different skin/scalp conditions online and I don't I've found my exact issue.

So, any ideas? In your opinion, does this sound like lice, dandruff, or some other issue?",0,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hi1ls5/29m_is_this_lice_dandruff_or_something_else/"")",2020-06-29 08:11:18,Physician Responded

For the past two weeks I've been very stressed, dealing with health anxiety and all that mess. Recently, I noticed these weird, what I can only describe as ""negative stains"" in my vision.

The problem is I'm not staring at anything that could cause after image eye burn and these stain blobs last far longer than regular after images.

hi25cf,Will I look like a drug seeker if I ask to take ativan the night before a colonoscopy?,"Female, 29, Canada, 130 lbs, 5 ft 6 in.

I'm having a colonoscopy and gastroscopy next week to check for possible IBD. I am a very anxious person who worries a lot. I have a prescription for Ativan from my GP, but I'm only supposed to take it when I fly.

I know I won't sleep well the night before the colonoscopy due to being nervous.

When I don't get enough sleep, I tend to be very nauseous. Sometimes I throw up when I wake up too early in the morning, for example.

On the morning of the procedure, I have to be up around 5-6 am to drink the colonoscopy prep. In normal circumstances, getting up at 5 am and drinking anything would probably make me throw up. 

Now combine drinking something gross with also not sleeping most of the night... I'd say the chances of me throwing up the prep are pretty high. I didn't tell my GI any of this, because I haven't actually met him - his office staff  called me to book the colonoscopy, and these questions came up after I started googling what the prep will be like.

I was thinking I could ask the GI doc if taking some Ativan at bedtime would be okay. That way I will at least sleep and will feel a bit better the morning of the procedure. But will it look like I'm abusing my ativan if I take it for something other than flying?

She advised me first to use vitamin E oil on nail root to eliminate psyoriasis. Didn’t help. And then she gave me another cream to put again on the nail root. It didn’t help. 

I did the microbial test twice, first time it said mold then in 2018 it said candida.

hi7nis,Any chiropractors here? Some concerns about my last visit and too anxious to go back.,"26f 118lbs 
.5 Xanax nightly as needed for sleep
Albuterol inhaler for mild asthma 
No smoking (I vape) 
Rare drinking. No drugs. 

I will start by saying I have panic disorder and some serious medical anxiety. Please be gentle in responses. 

I’ve been going to the chiropractor for about 3 weeks now for adjustments to my spine and neck. I have been fine at each appointment. 

At my last appointment, when he turned my neck to crack it, I got a wave sensation down my body and my limbs felt very very weak. I then had a panic attack in the office thinking something was very wrong. The chiropractor asked if I was okay, had me take deep breaths and helped me sit up. He did a thing where he checked my strength or something? And had me push my hands against his and pull. It was quick and he said I was all good. 

After calming down I left and continued having panic attacks each day about this. It’s been 5 days. My family/friends/spouse have all tried talking me down and reminding me if any damage was caused from the last adjustment I would know by now. I did not have any pain after the adjustment. Just the weakness and then the panic attack which consisted of the usual dizziness and hard to breathe. 

I’ve continued to feel the weakness specifically in my left side (the direction he cracked my neck) and have begun having minor discomfort in my neck and trouble finding a comfortable position. I made the mistake of turning to google which yielded terrifying possibilities that now have my mind racing. It has me thinking this could be some sort of stroke or artery dissection. I know how ridiculous I sound but anxiety is irrational and so hard to fight against sometimes. 

I am trying to avoid making an ER trip over this if I’m truly over reacting. I know panic can cause the same sensations I’m feeling. It’s just coincidental and I wanted to know if it’s possible this is related to the adjustment, if I should get checked out or if anyone here has knowledge about what might have happened, if anything. Or if it’s truly in my head. 

It’s mostly my left arm/hand, and while it feels like it’s weak I am still doing things normally for the most part I think. I have had no symptoms other than this and now today the neck discomfort. I’m scared and I feel like no one takes me seriously once they see my anxiety label. I’m truly struggling and could use some advice or words of encouragement and if this is something anyone has heard of happening before.",1,18,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hi7nis/any_chiropractors_here_some_concerns_about_my/"")",2020-06-29 13:10:12,Physician Responded
hi7nro,Mysterious bites/burn on my hand when i woke up,"I (28F, normal health, no current issues) live in Qatar currently, where there are no really seriously venomous creepy crawlies (apart from scorpions in the desert but i've never seen one), or anything really other than mosquitoes that can bite (as far as i know). As of about two weeks ago, i managed to eliminate all mosquitoes from my bedroom and have not seen one since, and regularly check my bed for creepy crawlies having found a massive house spider in my bed back in England once and never recovering.

Last night, i went to bed with a hot water bottle and woke up with a feeling like I had a massive bruise or burn on my hand, it was really sore when I brushed against the covers. When I looked there were two white areas with red borders that look very much like either bites or burns. They hurt when I touch them but do not itch, and as the day has progressed the one on my knuckle has developed a blister, but the one lower down has faded a little.

I am just wondering whether it is possible for someone to tell me what they might be (burns or bites) and whether I should be concerned. I have slept with hot water bottles before and not been burned, but I also have never seen bugs that might bite like this in my apartment, and have never heard of them in Doha at all.

The picture with both in was from this morning when I found them, and the pictures of each bite separately was taken about 30 minutes ago.

hi7uxr,Worth it to ask Doctor about Condoms?,"About me: 23, male, caucasian, 5'5"" 125lbs, and I only take medicine for allergies

I have not had many sexual encounters but I have had a lot of problems with Condoms. I have had the condom come off during sex multiple times, once fully came off and did not realize it for a while. I've also had them break. 

Obviously, both of these worry me a lot. I have bought a few different brands at the grocery store but they all work about the same - I can't tell any difference between them. I think the problem is that they are too wide. 

I have started to google search and it looks like there are some smaller types made but none of them are sold locally. Online only as far as I can tell. I can't really decipher what to get. 

Is it worth bringing this up with my Doctor? Do they have possible samples to give out? Or are they just basically going to suggest ""Order a boat load of varieties online and figure it out!"" It seems like that method could be expensive.

The headache is never really bad. It just helps to be in a quiet dark room so my eyes can stop hurting. No flashing lights, no nausea.

Also the skin above the eyebrow is very sensitive and tender to touch in some places. Some days it appears on the left side as well. But it is always prevalent on the right side. It feels like electricity shooting from l my browbone up my head and into my temples.

I have no other symptoms. No sinus issues, I haven't  been sick since January.

The ""bites"" that she has are directly attributed to her picking at her skin, and even if they were bites... they don't resemble that of one that would be caused by scabies. I don't know what to do.

hi9i7b,What is considered early for treating a basal cell carcinoma?,"Age: 37

Height: 5'7

Weight: 230

About three years ago, I noticed a spot on my forehead, near the upper left side at the hairline. It got larger over a few months and was kinda scaly, so I brought it up to the doctor I saw at that time. She barely looked at it and said it was fine. A year later, the spot had gotten larger and itchy, so I asked again, and she said it was nothing.

I changed doctors, and the spot was still larger, itchy, and had bled a couple times (probably about the size of a nickel) and when I showed my current doctor at the physical she was concerned and referred me to a dermatologist. The dermatologist did a biopsy and her nurse called today and told me that the spot was a basal cell carcinoma and that they'd call back later to schedule getting it removed.

I read online that BCCs rarely spread especially when caught early, but how much time would that be? Is three years considered early for this type of cancer and should I be concerned about it having spread elsewhere, like my brain?

I can sooth the itch slightly by scratching the back of my throat with my tongue or making a weird snorting noise like a pig oinking. For some reason doing this soothes the itch.

I should add that she has been totally fine since and hasn’t complained about feeling it in her nose or been scratching at her nose.

If they're making her have a normal office appt JUST to hear results, wouldn't that suggest she DIDN'T qualify?","This all came about because my 77 year old mother had to switch to a new rheum arthritis/pain mgmt doctor for her spinal stenosis after 9 years from first one retiring. He'd mentioned this minimally-invasive procedure he could perform on her that if successful could reduce pain 75%, but she'd need a fresh MRI for him to know if she qualified for it purely by physical, medical standards (not insurance). She was elated to hear of this new possibility. She had the MRI just over a week ago. When she finally got to talk to them today, the staff said the results are in, but she'd need a proper appointment to learn them, which won't happen til July 9th.

So my point is, if the results determine she is eligible, I'm actually kinda irked this is what's happening. He's already fully aware he has her consent for the procedure, if she's good to go, why do we need this 'middle man' step of telling her so sitting down in his office, why isn't the procedure itself the next step already being scheduled? Nothing really will change from her perspective between him telling her to her face she's right for it, then later doing it. Surely he can talk to her about all the finer points that day of the procedure.

Need advice regarding COVID risk.,"My girlfriend's mother \[60F\] has a history of cancer, blood pressure irregularities and has just been diagnosed with pneumonia about 10 days ago. She's currently awaiting improvement from her prescribed antibiotics. She tested negative for COVID at the peak of her symptoms. She's a non-smoker. 

Prior to any of these symptoms and when the news was looking good about two weeks ago, her daughter (a school teacher) purchased airline tickets to come visit Arizona, coming from Florida. She has quarantined properly (prior to this) and hasn't had any COVID symptoms. 

I realize this scenario sounds like a writing prompt but it's very much legitimate and days away at this point.

My questions are:

1. Is it possible that she actually DID have COVID but by the time she took the test it had turned into Pneumonia already?
2. Is having pneumonia a known risk factor for catching COVID? I have read plenty about COVID   
 leading to pneumonia but I'd imagine it's very risky the other way around. 
3. Where should the line be drawn for her visit? She initially planned to stay in their guest room but since then we've become concerned anyone visiting her **at all.**

hiol24,Can a Neuroradiologist/Radiologist Help Me with My Wife's Results,"My wife is a 29 year old female who has been complaining about right-sided tinnitus for about 4 or 5 months. Her audiology exam showed a slight hearing discrepancy between her two ears (I think like 10-15db at like 8,000hz). The ENT ordered an MRI without contrast as an initial screening and said that he would repeat the hearing test in several months to re-evaluate my wife's hearing. He also said that if the hearing discrepancy was changed, then it would be time for an MRI with contrast. I should also add that my wife suffers from pretty severe health anxiety.

Below is the radiologist's report (I don't have the images; at least at this time):

IMPRESSION: No mass or lesion of the bilateral cranial nerve VII/VIII complex within the limitations of noncontrast MRI.

TECHNIQUE:   
MRI of the brain and IAC was obtained with the following sequences:  Localizer, axial due to   
bar/ADC, axial T2, axial FLAIR, sagittal T1, coronal T2, IAC sequences (axial T2 and axial T1).

FINDINGS:  
Brain:  No acute infarct.   
Ventricles: No ventriculomegaly.   
Extra-axial spaces: No mass or lesion of the bilateral cranial nerve VII/VIII complex.    
Intracranial Flow Voids:  Grossly maintained  
Paranasal sinuses: Minimal paranasal sinus mucosal thickening  
Craniocervical Junction:  No evidence of cerebellar tonsillar ectopia.   
Osseous structures: No acute osseous abnormality.

To me, my wife has nothing to worry about. I spent countless hours reading through academic articles about how noncontrast MRI can often detect IAC masses. However, my wife is freaking out about the ""within the limitations of noncontrast MRI"" language. Am I correct in telling my wife that she most likely doesn't have an acoustic neuroma?

However, I still have a lowish grade fever (101 this am). Doc can’t explain this. I also have developed a patchy, itchy, bumpy rash on random parts of my skin including my neck, an arm, and my torso. Doc thinks this is unrelated. I trust her.. but I still feel a little bit like I don’t understand what is going on.

hipq7u,Questions about MRI results of back,"32 y/o male, 4 years 6 months smoke free, 6'3"", 200lbs, no underlying medical conditions that I know of. 

I've been having some weird things happening to me over the last 8 years or so - Wild muscle fasciculations in my back when I lay down (but only when I lay down) to the point that my girlfriend could feel the bed shaking, severe sciatica pain, random numbness in my extremities, left leg has randomly given out over the last few months. I've always been pretty active, but the pain in my upper back, lower left back and left leg has prevented me from being active at all for the last year or so, to the point where painting two walls in a room for an hour, had me laid up on the couch in agony for the rest of the day. It's gotten worse over the last 5 months. I've been doing a lot of stretching at the insistence of my doctor, but it's only seemed to cause more pain. 

My whole life, doctors have basically ignored and brushed off everything I bring up to them. I've got an incredibly high pain tolerance, so when they see me walk in without limping and I say ""I'm in agonizing pain"", I get the ""You're young and healthy, you're fine!"" ""Oh you're just tight, you need to stretch!"" I'm on my 3rd primary care doctor at this point because of this, and even he was of the ""you're just tight"" mindset and has been suggesting yoga for the last 6 months. I finally insisted on an MRI, and wouldn't budge. I got the results back, and when the doctor called to follow up he sounded kind of apologetic, said ""I'm honestly not sure how you were able to walk in here"" and remarked that the issues were pretty extensive. The results were: 

1: Mild disc bulging at T3-T3 without cord deformity. 

2: Annular fissure within the posterior central T7-T8 disc with associated central disc protrusion causing mild cord deformity.

3: Mild T8-T9 disc bulging with superimposed right paracentral disc protrusion. 

4: Left paracentral disc extrusion at T9-T10 superimposed on mild disc bulging causing mild cord deformity. 

5: L5-S1 Annular fissure right paracentral posterior disc with associated disc extrusion. Grade 1 retrolisthesis measuring 2.5mm. Compression of the right traversing S1 nerve root. No neural foraminal stenosis. No facet joint. 

So my questions are: Would this explain the symptoms of the back muscle fasciculations when I lay down? Just how extensive is this? I'd like to avoid surgeries, so is this something that can likely be repaired with physical therapy? Is this really extensive damage for someone my age, and possibly a sign of more serious underlying issues?

hipy9t,"Pink eye for four days, now my cornea looks rough and uneven(not smooth). Please help I can't see any doctors.","I'm 20F, no diseases, no allergies.

5 days ago my right eye turned pink and the day after that my left one turned pink too. I called my friend who is an ER doctor and he told me to take antibiotic eye drops. I have been taking the drops for 3 days but it isn't getting any better and my eyes are still itchy. 

I went to another doctor yesterday who said it was allergic after looking a 30 sec slit lamp examination and no questions at all, but I think he is wrong because my eyes have been leaving a yellowish crust when I wake up and also I have no sneezing, blocked or runny nose and I generally don't get allergies. He prescribed an antihistamine eyedrop and corticosteroid eyedrop. I took the antihistamine but skipped the steroid because I read it can prolong the infection and I wasn't too confident in this doctor tbh. 

Today I was looking at my eye and noticed that my right eye (the more severe of the two) has a patch of very uneven cornea (the transparent part).  It's still red, it was more crusty than usual this morning and this roughness is new.

I don't mean the gritty feeling which I had already, this is visibly uneven,  kinda bubbly like when your fingers get wet.

I don't want to go to the doctor again because he really rushed me out of his clinic and probably reached the wrong diagnosis. No other opthalmologists are around and I don't want to be riding public transport during covid.

I'm really worried, should I go to the ER? Go back to the same doctor? Or is this a normal part of pink eye that I can wait out?

Edit: this pic isn't very clear but you can see how the light on my eye is dotted and not smooth. The other eye looks white because both eyes are only red on the inside corners (near the nose).

Hi,

I have a really bad headache which started with pain in the left part of my forehead when bending down or straining but now has become a full blown headache with pain when looking at screens, it's hard to look at screens now, my eyes go out of focus quickly.

I have spoken to the doctor and they have said there are no red flags and that you should reduce screen time, drink fluids and take painkillers. I have never taken a painkiller and they said you can get them in oral form but i would have to go to chemist which i don't want to do. And I'm warry about taking a painkiller.

My life is basically sitting on the PC in my room so I am looking at screens every day all day, and i have been doing this for years... Only now i'm getting these issues.

Addtionally a couple of months ago was when my eyes started getting blurry when looking at screens now i have pain in my head and it's much worser. Any remedies for digital eye straIn or computer vision syndrome?

hiqwrk,Chiropractor says our 3 mo baby needs suboccipital manipulations for 'KiSS Syndrome',"Baby is 3 months old exactly, 13 lbs 8 Oz and prescribed zantac (randitine) and now famotidine for reflux (GERD) which seems to be doing nothing. 

I have a 3 mo and me and my partner are beyond frustrated with some issues our 3 month old baby is facing developmentally. 

Baby (LO) was born completely healthy, full term even though me (Mom) had a traumatic and long vaginal delivery. 

LO has always been a refluxer and hiccuper. The 1 month checkup went with no issues apart from me mentioning reflux and the doctor saying it's a laundry problem not a baby problem. The trouble really started around 5-6 weeks when LO suddenly started refusing the breast and crying though clearly hungry. I figured it was fast letdown and just kept at it. Then at 7 weeks I happened to watch a video on YouTube about '2 month old typical and atypical development' and realised that something was very wrong. 

LO could barely lift their head when placed on their stomach and cried incessantly. Tummy time was non existent because of this. Also when laid on their back, LO took a distinct C shape. Also baby started feeding for 2 minutes max and crying continuously the rest of the tine.  Alarm bells ringing, I called up a very respected lactation consultant who also happens to be a pediatric chiropractor. 

Chiropractor has a look at my baby and says LO has KiSS syndrome (Kinematic Imbalance due to Suboccipital Strain) and says LO needs some in person sessions. Chiro says LO has massive strains on their neck. These sessions are expensive but me and my partner, horrified about KiSS syndrome turning to KiDD syndrome, go ahead and do it.  Meanwhile Chiropractor tells us to do some exercises which are basically head tilts and rotations. 

Meanwhile baby's 2 month appointment comes by and GP says the baby has torticollis and says LO needs physio. Physiotherapist on video link only, thanks to covid, says that although they don't know anything about KiSS syndrome to continue exercises that the chiropractor is saying, because they're essentially torticollis physio stretches and that they 💯 believe in the chiropractors ability to treat babies. LO starts to get better at lifting head. 

Now the problem is me and my partner are perplexed about the chiropractors in person 'manipulation' sessions. All Chiro seems to do is jiggle LOs butt and click this thing at LO that 'sends impulses from their body part to their brain' for nearly $100. We've been to a few sessions so far and I honestly don't see a huge improvement after them, I think it's the physio stretches we're doing. Chiropractor also says torticollis is 'an aspect of KiSS syndrome'. 

LO and I still struggle with breastfeeding, LO still refluxes despite being prescribed zantac and LO still screams bloody murder when laid on their chest. 

Also this KiSS syndrome diagnosis sounds a little dubious. Though LO exhibits some of the postures of a baby with KiSS type 1 and type 2, I can find no 'respectable' medical literature on the same which is making me believe it's a term coined by chiropractors. There's less than 10 search results on Google and only a handful Google images. 

Has anyone come across this term or syndrome? My own GP seems to give me the impression that they think its bull. 

Someone please tell me how to help my baby because it seems to be in constant discomfort. Is the reflux causing LO to hate being laid on their chest?",8,81,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hiqwrk/chiropractor_says_our_3_mo_baby_needs/"")",2020-06-30 09:41:11,Physician Responded

**Presenting complaint**: got some kind of L-sided ear/sinus infection or head cold in early March a/w hearing loss and tinnitus. He has had about 15 tinnitus attacks (+ transient mild hearing loss) in the same ear since then, and they severely affect his QoL and mental wellbeing.

**Co-existing issues**: none, including no allergies

**Past issues**: 

* spontaneous SVT in November that required DC cardioversion but not diagnosed with Afib
*  ""sensitive stomach""/potential IBS

**Current meds**: 

* nasal steroids
*  oral bilastine

**Past meds for current condition**: tried antibiotic eardrops and nasal/sinus steroidal rinse x2/12,

**Social**: drinks occasionally, never smoked, no recreational drugs

The working theory was eustaschian tube dysfunction due to damage from the infection, and it has now evolved to be some kind of allergy.

&amp;#x200B;

My SO has been suffering from seemingly random tinnitus attacks since early March a/w transient mild hearing loss. He has seen an ENT six times, without adequate relief. He is using nasal steroids and oral bilastine. His ENT really doesn't seem to be interested in getting to the bottom of the issue, and my SO is driving himself mad trying to figure this out on his own. The ENT said he would refer  him to an allergy specialist but he forgot to do so until we called to remind him, so now we have to wait another 3 weeks to see this specialist.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, what do you think could be a trigger or allergy? He has kept detailed food logs and has ruled out gluten, dairy, and alcohol. Pollen is possible - the ENT seems to think it is some kind of seasonal condition - but unlikely because he's been out and about all springtime with no correlation.

&amp;#x200B;

As a graduating medical student, I echo his frustration and think it's high time he gets a second opinion from an ENT who isn't as dismissive. The only issue that he's in Canada, meaning specialists will only see patients if they have a referral. His current ENT only sees him as a favor for a family friend, so he was never officially referred, and he does not have a GP (he's been on the waiting list for 3 years.)

&amp;#x200B;

He's understandably hesitant to ask his current ENT for a referral to another ENT. Would you consider it rude if a patient asked you to do this? Bonus points if you're from a similar healthcare system.

Okay so 3 years ago, I noticed that my left testicle is noticeably bigger than my right one. And the testicle was more sensitive to being touched, as if it kinda swelled overnight. I didn’t really know what it was, nor did I care. I mean it didn’t really hurt, only some minor abdominal pain on my left side and only if I’m pressuring it so I didn’t care about it. I also expected it to go away in few days. Almost 3 years later, and it’s the exact same. Same size swelling, slight “pain”(more like discomfort) when I pressure the left side of my abdomen. I look it up and I read cancer is the most common reason for this, which gets me worried as fuck because I’ve been like this for 3 years, so I’m afraid it’ll be in a really advanced stage. It’ll be a bit tough to get it checked up as early as I’d want to due to the coronavirus so can you guys tell me what you think and how likely it is to be cancer in a late stage?",2,13,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hiuq70/worried_i_might_have_a_late_stage_testicular/"")",2020-06-30 12:48:04,Physician Responded

I guess I'd appreciate whatever help or suggestions? I can't really go to a doctor anytime now, or buy medication so yeah.

I’m not particularly squeamish- I don’t love needles, but things like vaccinations don’t scare me too much. But something about a needle going into my veins really freaks me out - especially when it’s in my inner elbow. I get nauseated just thinking about that area on my arm. I keep debating whether or not to call the office and tell them this? But I’m worried they’ll just laugh me off like I have been in the past. Every other time I’ve brought it up to a phlebotomist or nurse, they tell me to buck up or just look away. Neither is very helpful.

My diet kind of sucks though. I have a huge sweet tooth, and I love salty and greasy foods. I am able to keep my weight normal because I limit my overall caloric intake, but the quality of those calories is not good. 

I do have a family history of high blood pressure. How concerned should I be about mine?

I got a lot of “I don’t know”... my Gynecologist said she’s going to reset my uterus lining. Turns out she scrapped off cysts. She knew I had cysts apparently. They said “we got at much as we can. There was cysts inside and outside of your uterus”. They never once told me I had them, But it still bleeds. Birth control pills does stop it so i have just been taking those.

I have more stories but I need to get to the actual thing. 

doctors wrote in my chart “Brain Degeneration Disease”  after seeing my CT. I honestly thought I was just getting really really dumb. Things were getting worse (every day things). Holding stuff, reading, spelling, math, etc. then I started to twitch really bad, forgetting I had a boyfriend, my hand just dropped things. After my CT things still got worse. My speech, headaches, memory, forgot objects like a toothbrush so I just described what the object does, my jaw twitches when I’m talking. I can feel it but it’s not that noticeable. Since it does it when I’m talking it messes up words and you can hear that. My tongue starts to twitch too but when I’m not talking. Tremors in my hands, arms, and legs.

hklvx7,Step dad [56M] with brain infection,"Last weekend my step dad reported dizziness, vomiting and weakness on the right side of his body. We called an ambulance as we thought he might have been having a stroke. At the hospital though, once some tests had been performed it appears that was not the case. The doctors are saying that he has a brain infection. They said his brain is also bleeding and he is in need of surgery as soon as possible, but that there is too much swelling so they are currently trying to reduce swelling. They also said that he has brain lesions that are rather deep, and when/if swelling is reduced they will need to evaluate whether surgery is even worth it. 

He has been intubated to help him breathe, but he is still awake. He is only able to open 1 eye, but is still kind of communicating by nodding and giving thumbs up/ hand squeezes. We think this all stemmed from an infection in his knee that was left untreated (much to the frustration of the rest of our family, having prodded him about it constantly for the past 6 months. He is hard headed) and possibly spread to his blood and onward. 

Yesterday a nurse from the hospital called my mom to ask permission to do some kind of study on him, and she mentioned that there would be surveys taken at 6 months and 12 months post recovery. Before this conversation we had pretty much given up hope, but is there a possibility he could recover from this?

My son was born with this rash on the side of his nose and it still hasn’t gone away. Every time I am with the pediatrician they tel me to not worry about it. My husband as a baby had to have goats milk instead of formula but I was fine but he never had any rashes. I decided to switch my baby to a formula without cows milk to see if the rash would go away. It has been a week but no change, I was going to have him stay on it for a month and see. He is starting to get a little of a rash also on the other side of his nose.

Questions:

1. Is this a rash to be concerned about at all, I can’t find any information online about this kind of “rash” if that’s what it even is.

2. Should my baby get allergy testing?

3. Will this ever go away if this is “normal?”

4. Should I get a new pediatrician who takes this more seriously?

5. Do I wait until he is a year old when he is fully on solids to see if this goes away?

I am a first time mom but I feel like this “rash” shouldn’t be there but I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to miss anything.

**Reason for Visit:** E&amp;M for anemia

**HPI:** Patient is being followed for Multifactorial Anemia including Erythropoietin deficiency from underlying CKD. She is on monthly Darbepoetin injections to keep her hemoglobin 10-11 g/dL.

**Patient:** Female, 69YO, obese

**Past Medical History:**

COPD (former smoker), 

Type 2 Diabetes, 

Diastolic dysfunction with EF of 70-75%, 

Urosepsis after back surgery (2014)

\[Then there is a breakdown of her CBC and Metabolic panel (if you need results from that, I can include them; they're basically what you'd expect--Low levels involving her RBCs, and slightly elevated glucose/BUN).\]                                                              
\_\_\_

**Impression and Plan** \[*emphasis mine as to what is particularly confusing*\]:

Her hemoglobin is holding stable and has not needed Darbepoetin for 3 months. I would like to move her to every 3-month visits as she may just slowly drop over time. I explained that she will either maintain herself OR need occasional injections. There is no benefit in trying to push her hemoglobin higher. *The previous SPEP may be going away although she still has slightly elevated light chain ratio. I will check this again in a year. Interestingly she has a low IgG and IgM and I am not sure whether it is inherited or acquired--there is no one else in the family with CVID. As for now we will monitor her. I explained to her that patients who are very low and have recurrent major infections benefit from IVIG replacement but I do not think that she needs to do this at this time. There is no other evidence of Lymphoproliferative disorder.*",2,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hkpi16/help_reading_my_mothers_results_multifactoral/"")",2020-07-03 12:39:33,Physician Responded

Pretty straight forward question. It looks like a pimple, but it's close enough to the lip to maybe be a cold sore. Anyone know which is it? I just noticed it last night. It doesn't feel tingly or anything. It is faintly tender if I stretch my skin around it.

There are several of them on my boyfriend’s lower legs. Probably 15 total. They aren’t bites (Not raised, dry, or itchy. They fade in a couple of days ) and he gets them when he has to stand on a ladder and paint for long periods of time for his job. They kind of look like a bunch of petechiae but larger. Don’t know if it’s relevant but for the sake of being as descriptive as possible: Both of us noticed in the past that when he was a server and worked long shifts he would get similar marks around his sock line, but they weren’t circular like this. They also went away after a few days. His fingers tend to swell pretty frequently. He had a stress test and an echo in October after a concerning EKG and the doctor said there wasn’t anything for him to worry about, but the documents say “intermediate risk” for cardiac event.

	Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) went from 34 to 153
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) went from 12 to 72. 

In the time between blood test I started on my current meds and lost around 15 pounds. I do not feel sick or anything. I am really worried and my appointment is not till the end of August.

Over the last month I have been experiencing a dull pain in my chest, ranging from the right side, middle, to left and some times my entire chest. Ive had an appointment with my primary a few months ago when this pain was exclusive to only the left side of my chest, and he said it was just musculoskeletal pain. With the spread of this pain I have begun to get very paranoid about it. I have an appointment with my primary again, but it is a week out and my anxiety is killing me. This pain seems to disappear when I sleep, or sit with a good posture for awhile. As far as I can tell it does not get worse when I breathe, nor does it become sharper when I breathe deeply. I do not have a cough, shortness of breath, nor do I get winded. My paranoia is trying to convince me I have some sort of lung cancer, is there anyone here that can put my mind at ease from these thoughts?

Last night I couldn't go back to sleep due to an urge to pee and I continue to have this slight urge even now. I have peed a good like 7 times today from when I woke up around 3:40AM.

Is my anxiety about this issue possibly the cause?

I am pretty healthy, lift weights and do cardio occasionally. I have no allergies and am not currently on any medication. I have not consumed coffee or alcohol in over a month.

They then diagnosed her with lung cancer after her scans. A week after her biopsy, the lung specialist then told us it was not lung cancer but a rare form of cancer and she will need to be referred onto another specialist as it’s soft tissue cancer in the lungs. 

I did some research about lung cancer that I finally had my head wrapped around what to expect but now I’m really struggling to understand what soft tissue cancer is as everything I’m reading isn’t making sense to me.

hkuiji,low cervix (?),"18f, caucasian, 5’8”, and 160 lbs. 
i’m not really that well-versed in vaginal health. i don’t know for sure if this is normal or not but better safe than sorry. **also, they don’t allow people under 21 to go to the obgyn at my local clinic, i tried to make an appointment months before quarantine but they didn’t let me.**

i don’t remember a time when this was ever different, but ever since i actually began checking my own vaginal health, i discovered something that doesn’t seem *normal,* especially after a decent amount of research? it seems like my cervix is at the entrance of my vagina, when i feel down there i don’t even go down any kind of a hole and i feel something that feels like two bulbs of flesh. when i took a picture, it looked like there was a flesh oval with a tiny hole in the middle, right at the start of where the vaginal opening should be. it was lighter than the surrounding flesh.

even as a kid, sometimes when i sat i felt like i was sitting on a little ball? i’ve never been pregnant or had sex. i don’t feel any constant pain down there, i only really get pain when i put off going to the bathroom for way too long, when i get period cramps, or when i have that feeling of sitting on a ball. also, my periods are short (2-3 days,) but i don’t know if that has anything to do with it or not. i’ve never been able to use tampons.

as for medical issues and medicine, i have hypothyroidism, and i take: 

• 50 mcg of levothyroxin each morning (been doing so for about a month or two now)

• 150 mg of sertraline each morning (it’s been bumped up from 50 and 100, but i’ve been on it for 4 years i believe?)

• 150 mg of bupropion each morning (for about a year i think?)

• 200 mg of quetiapine each night (for ~4 years also, been bumped up from 50, 100, and 150)

it’s been a long time that i’ve been curious about this. like i stated earlier, i tried to make an obgyn appointment but i’m not old enough for my local clinic. i’ve asked around online, people have said it’s not normal. idk. it worries me a lot. sorry for how badly this post is written i’m pretty tired",3,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hkuiji/low_cervix/"")",2020-07-03 17:54:14,Physician Responded

Primary complaint: Tachycardia

Duration: Unknown, at least a few months 

Existing medical issues: PCOS, IBS, hayfever, recurrent heartburn, recurrent anaemia 

Medication: Desogestrel, buscopan PRN

Do not drink, smoke or take drugs

So, I've been having bouts of tachycardia. I can feel my heart racing, and I can also see it happening on my fitbit. I feel like I should say that my heart rate normally runs between 80-90, and that is normal for me. The highest I have seen my pulse spike to is around 144. This usually occurs after I have done something physical, but I sometimes feel unsteady on my legs when it happens. I get short of breath on occasion, too. I have no chest pains when it happens, and no symptoms of a heart attack. There's a long standing history of cardiac problems on my Mum's side of the family, and my Dad recently suffered a heart attack (STEMI) and 3x cardiac arrests (but is recovering well). I guess my Dad's recent illness has made me concerned?

I have quite the painful ear infection and everyone who had one before knows exactly how painful that is... I'd rather risk suffocating than enduring this pain. But I was wondering if there is something I can do to avoid this and why it even causes breathing to be harder, there is barely any information on the internet about it and nothing mentioned in the note that comes with the medicine (Germany). 
Not sure if that is important but I used to have asthma as a child but it was cured long ago still when I was a child, I'm 23 now and it never caused problems again.

Edit: I don't smoke, I don't take any other kind of medicine other than the drops for the ear the Doctor gave me.

I met with my primary doctor to do blood work and get an event monitor to watch my heart to make sure everything is ok. Well I ended up looking at 2 previous CBC Results and it gave me a lot of concern. They were from 2015 and 2017. 

In both years PLT, HGB, WBC, HCT, and RBC were normal. However I had 0.05 and 0.10 immature granulocytes (lab range 0-0.3) n 2015 and 2017, respectively. Also, in 2017 my neutrophils were 7.15 (lab normal 2.5-7) and overall WBC 9.62. So I did the differential calculate and that means my neutrophils were high at 74%. My lymphs were 1.52 (lab normal 0.9-3). I did the differential again and that's 16% which is low. 

I had another CBC done 2 days ago with a slightly elevated RBC 5.73 (lab normal 4.4-5.7) and normal WBC again but they didn't do a differential this time. In 2015 and 2017 the doctor didn't bring the differential results to my attention. I googled stuff and convince myself it's CML or some other type of cancer.

I've known for 10+ years now I don't want children of my own - i don't dislike them at all, I love being around kids and don't mind babysitting or anything. But I have fibromyalgia (possibly another condition that's being tested for), anxiety, and depression, and to be honest the thought of another organism inside of me makes me want to puke. I don't think i'd be a very good parent because due to my conditions I can sometimes have a short fuse - if I sometimes get too worked up over my cats constantly meowing and can barely handle my job on my bad days, there is NO WAY I can handle a baby - it wouldn't be fair to them or me. 

My boyfriend agrees with me as well, and we're happy being childless. I'm also trying to lose weight and want to get off of hormonal contraceptives because I think that would help me lose - not to mention I've been on them for ten years and grew up in a smoking home -I'm worried about blood clots. 

I guess my question is how I can come across as confident enough in my decision that a doctor won't try to tell me i'm wrong and i'll ""grow out of it""?

I am a mathematics student and am planning to enter into graduate school to pursue research in mathematics.

Doing mathematics involves a fair bit of thinking and visualisation/imagination. We have to picture many situations in our head (for example, higher dimensions) which cannot be physically realised in the real world that we live in. When I engage myself in such problems, my head starts aching quite soon and quite bad. And it starts to heat up too, it becomes heavy and I can feel it tightening up. It's like my head is being made to lift heavy weights.

My head hurts primarily on the top and in the sides. And I have some strain and tightness in my neck as well, just under the head. Sometimes, it goes into my shoulders and thoracic back area too. I must inform that I have migraine type headaches too. But these are different that I get from studying/concentrating.

A light massage with my fingers feels relieving and sometimes, when it is very bad, I take an ibuprofen which helps. Applying pressure on certain points in the neck and head also relieves pain. I do wear glasses and I wear them quite religiously.

This happens every time I start studying and get engaged in deep thinking. It is disturbing as I cannot concentrate for long periods of time as I should for my subject, because of these headaches.

Any help/advice is highly appreciated.

P.S. I've been having these for at least 5-6 years. But it usually goes with rest and medication. I've been running for a year now, which has also helped.

reason for this is bc the 60 mg helps my focus more than the lower doses and doc wants to keep me on it for this reason. but it also stunts my appetite a whole lot. its been *sorta* better after a month on it but im still only eating a small meal a day.

hl8rwp,Why do doctors stop listening when you mention your mental illness?,"I’m 25, female, white, NY, 5’2”, 158lb, never smoker. Take modafinil as needed. I’m bipolar type 2, have migraines.

I went to see a rheumatologist about an elevated ANA and some troubling joint pain/skin rashes, and as soon as I disclosed being bipolar he blamed it all on that being “uncontrolled.” I don’t think bipolar causes swollen lymph nodes or photosensitive rashes. He said I have a chronic pain syndrome exacerbated by being unmedicated, but this does not explain the inflammatory symptoms.

I’m unmedicated because: 1. I lost my health insurance recently, 2. I’ve reacted severely to six different SSRIs/SNRIs, lithium turns me into a zombie, and lamictal caused said severe skin reaction. I had these symptoms even when it was controlled and I was taking lithium but he didn’t care too much about that.

I feel once again like I’m being reduced to being “crazy” which I can always tell by them mentioning my “extensive psych history.” He didn’t write down half of what I said. He did some squeezing on my arms and legs and stuff to elicit pain responses and said my shoulders can hyperextend and I have TMJ. Great. Now I have to wait two more months and repeat expensive bloodwork, and go back to someone who boiled my illness down to “she’s crazy.”

He told me to go see a psychiatrist which is a nice notion if I had the money or could find one that isn’t terrible. So do none of my other physical complaints matter when I’m “crazy?” If you’re saying my symptoms are psychosomatic you’re calling me crazy *and* a liar, and I have pictures of the rashes and brought my husband to back me up. But my husband tried and the doctor told him to be quiet and let me talk, which again is nice, but if he’s already made up his mind that it’s all in my head then my words mean nothing.",248,139,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hl8rwp/why_do_doctors_stop_listening_when_you_mention/"")",2020-07-04 12:07:40,Physician Responded
hla2f1,Why do I throw up so often and how do I get help?,"I am 23F, 5'4 and 118 lbs. so for like four years now, every month or couple of months I get sick in the middle of the night. I wake up shaking/cold sweats, resting heart rate in the 100s, and I throw up a few times. But then I fall asleep early in the morning and wake up fine.

  


  


  


Sometimes my muscles are super sore or my chest/upper back are in pain. But I'm mostly back to normal. Three years ago, I was diagnosed with gallstones and had my gallbladder removed. I thought that was the end of it.

  


  


However, I still get sick like this often (including right now). I don't know what to do. I don't have a primary care physician anymore and by the time I can make an appointment to see a doctor, I wouldn't be showing any symptoms. Should I just make an appointment somewhere anyways and describe what's happening or will that be ineffective?

  


  


  


Besides my gallbladder, I'm in good health. I exercise, don't smoke or anything, and I'm not a heavy drinker. I'm unclear on my family's medical history, but if there was something relevant in there, I'm sure my parents would tell me since I've been in pain like this for years. I'm just not sure what to do. I'm tired of being in pain like this and I'm sure all this throwing up is not good for me

Edit: it's not my period or related to food. I've been keeping track for about a year and it just happens randomly, never after I eat a certain something.

hlan76,Scared of ALS - EMG needle was in flexor pollicis brevis but the twichting is in Adductor pollicis brevis,"Hi, 

I hope I would appreciate getting an answer because I am really nervous if the EMG was done correctly.

My right thenar thumb muscle - the adductor pollicis brevis is twitching since weeks whenever I move it in a certain position and it is slightly contracted.

One Neurologist performed an EMG and inserted the needle before looking where exactly it twitches.

We could both hear the twitching popping in the EMG as soon as I contracted the muscle slighty.

She was putting the needle deeper or in slightly different position, not sure, and said I should relax. Then she said contract again and I did and you could hear the sound again.
She asked me again if I did it on purpose and I said yes.
Then she said, maybe the Carpal Tunnel ( I had problems with it about 6 years ago) is causing the problem.
As long as the EMG is silent when the muscle is relaxed I dont need to worry.

At home I saw it was about 1 cm above the twitching muscle.
She put the needle in the flexor pollicis brevis and the twitching is in the adductor pollicis brevis.
I asked via email because she was in hilidays and got a short answer that it was ok the way she did it.

Is that really true?
I hear from people getting EMGs in a lot of muscles and she only put one needle and not in the twitching muscle
Maybe the muscle was just moved from the fasciculations from the neighbour muscle so the EMG was ok, although it would not have been in the right spot?

Someone told me, it doesnt matter, because if it would be ALS you would also have seen it because of nerve pathways, or somehing like that. 
But I found out these two muscles are both innervated by the medianus nerve but the one she put the needle in, also from the nervus ulnaris.

The gum isn't as painful now but i still experience bleeding periodically even without touching it.

This is concerning because i've been having post nasal drip for a few months now (ent found nothing wrong and assumed that it's gerd after allergic test turned negative), which means i am also occasionally coughing and today happened something very terrifying, i saw blood in my saliva after coughing (i didn't actually cough up bloody phlegm but it was still pretty scary). 

Not sure what to do. I am in isolation most time of the week and wearing a mask when going to public areas so i guess the chances of getting an infection like covid or pneumonia is pretty low right? 

Should i go to a doctor other than a dentist? I am really scared that it's more serious than just a bleeding gum :(.

It can be either a toe or a finger and it doesn’t seem to be caused by me injuring them in any way.

hlbwt5,"Doctor says I NEED a circumcision, however I am very much against the idea if possible.","22M, White, US, Have some mild eczema but I do not believe it to be the problem

NSFW PICTURES: https://imgur.com/a/edDGR2U

Currently have a hard white lump/lesion on the underside of my foreskin about the size of a pea. When the foreskin is rolled back it is a lump about half a cm out of the skin and it also goes about half a cm inside of the foreskin. When the foreskin is in its natural position, it is completely covered up. It is not painful when I am not engaged in sexual activities of any kind, however it is somewhat sore if erect and rubbed on.

I believe what happened was my girlfriend and I were having sex and at some point a tore a small tear on my skin. I did not noticed until afterwards. I kept the area clean and did not have sex for ~1 week until I thought the wound was healed. After we started to have sex again, it began to look like this. The doctors say they are unsure what I am currently affected by, but I think it may be scar tissue of some sort from having sex before the wound fully healed? I had STD testing done and it all came back negative.

After speaking with a doctor, him and a colleague recommended a full circumcision (I'm in the US). However, I am very much opposed to this if possible as I am not originally from the US and find circumcision to be somewhat backwards unless absolutely necessary (Just my opinion and I understand others may not feel the same). While I respect the fact that they are knowledgeable doctors, I also feel like simply removing the affected area would work rather than removing the entire foreskin.

Has anyone had any problem like this before? Should I look at another clinic for a second opinion?

Hysterectomy at the beginning of March with removal of uterus &amp; fibroids, cervix, and tubes. They also removed a cyst on my right ovary and cleaned out a bunch of endometriosis.

My recovery was fine, uneventful up until the last two weeks or so. I thought I was having a period without the bleeding, I was crampy but it wasn't terrible. But it hasn't stopped, and the discomfort seems to be slowly getting worse.

The discomfort and twinges seem to be mostly in the area of my right ovary, but the cramping will spread to the entirety of my pelvis until the whole area is uncomfortable. Lying down seems to help, as I generally feel fine in the morning and the discomfort becomes worse throughout the day. 

I have been having trouble reaching my doctor due to the pandemic. I did finally speak with a nurse, who suggested maybe I had a UTI and they'd get back to me to let me know if I should come in. Haven't heard back yet. I kind of doubt it's a UTI, I don't have to pee any more often than usual and there's no associated pain. I'm not having any discharge or bleeding, and I'm not running a fever, so a cuff infection seems unlikely. But thanks to the pandemic, I have not had an internal exam after my surgery, so I don't know what the hell might be going on down there.

Any ideas what the hell is wrong with me? Did the endo grow back this fast, or is it another ovarian cyst? Is this something that can wait until the pandemic has calmed down (I'm in Arizona, shit is bananas right now) or should I insist they get me in to see someone?

hlcjxc,'Brain fog' ever since my first seizure last year,"I'm a 23M, currently taking no medications.

Last November I had my first short seizure after injesting ecstacy (mdma), where I remember tensing my right upper body and went to the ER where they did a CT scan and blood work, but found nothing wrong. Since then I've been having 'brain fog' where I have a lack of mental clarity and feels as if the back of my head is full.

In January I had more blood work done and found that I had a creatine kinase level of 7000, but the doctor who administered the blood test didn't even mention anything to me and sent me off with an anti inflammatory prescription which did nothing.

Since then I noticed how my muscles on my upper right area are tight so I've been going to a physical therapist who told me I had tight right neck and shoulder muscles which were causing my issues. Months go on and the physical therapy is only a helping a little so I go back to a doctor in May. This doctor tells me that my creatine kinase was high in January, but now was back to normal, which is good.

Desperate, I went to a chiropractor who did some x-rays on my neck and asked me if my neck had some trauma (from the seizure contractions??) because he noticed some damage. So he did some adjustments, but I haven't noticed much difference.

Why was my creatine kinase so high nearly 2 months after the seizure? I really think this muscle tension is related to my 'brain fog' and head fullness sensations, but what can I do about it? Could there be a structural problem? Is there a specialist I can see for this? I'm thinking neurologist, but I don't know.

Long story short, I've been diagnosed with corona 8 days ago and about 3-4 days into the diagnosis, stuff was getting rough. I fell asleep with my mercury thermometer in my armpit and the next thing i know I hear it crash in a few pieces beneath my bed next to the floor. Truth be told, I felt horrible. Didn't really feel like cleaning it up at the time so i just picked up the largest pieces and went back to rest for another hour or two. I then remembered mercury isn't exactly safe and if I don't plan on cleaning it then and there (it fell at a really awkward spot and i just knew i wouldnt have the energy for a full cleanup) I should probably atleast exit the room and lock the door(its air compressed when locked), and so I did. Fast forward to today - luckily, I'm feeling pretty great but I just realised I probably cooked a mess in my room leaving that mercury to just... vaporize in my room for a few days. It was pretty hot outside for the past few days aswell. So i finally walk back in and to my horror i realize that somehow there wasnt so much mercury on the floor next to the bed, but actually there were quite a few tiny droplets ON the bed sheets, blanket etc. I rested there for like...an hour or two before i left the room and I dont recall showering before going into a different bed. I immediately cleaned everything up, removed all the sheets etc but I can't help but wonder... Should I worry? I basically marinated my body in those droplets for those 2 hours before i switched beds and i know that stuff can be toxic. Should i test myself or something?

hlfdep,Burned my arm. Do I need medical attention??,"28-year-old male; 6'2; 178 lbs; just burned my arm while cooking dinner. I'm also a bit of a hypochondriac and super freaking out about this.

I was trying to get a pizza out of the oven (425 degrees Fahrenheit) and the top of my forearm bumped the oven coils on the top of the oven. My arm was only in contact for a few seconds as I immediately recoiled after touching it. I ran my arm under cool water for 5 or 10 minutes and then put Neosporin on it. I'm planning on putting some aloe vera on the burn after I shower.

My arm still hurts pretty bad and the skin is slightly raised where I burned myself. I've tried looking at Google images to gauge the severity of my burn, but that hasn't helped at all. It seems like second-degree burns have blisters, but I really just have redness and raised skin that kind of folds when I bend my arm (see pictures). This isn't anything I need to go to the hospital for, correct??? Does it look like a first degree burn or more like a second?

I was wondering if anyone could give me their thoughts or opinions on my symptoms.   I first had a hormone test near the end of 2017 and have only been able to see my endocrinologist once. Appointments kept being cancelled due to understaffing in the hospital and then my latest appointment was cancelled due to COVID.  
I have been having migraines since around 2017 and sometimes they attack daily for a month. I can then go a month without having any to suddenly suffering a whole week straight. My cortisol levels have been high since 2017. My general practitioner has not been doing follow ups, I had to pester them constantly to even get a blood test whilst I waited to be seen by my endocrinologist as I had many symptoms of an under active thyroid. I started taking 25mg of levothyroxine in the beginning of 2018 and have been on it since. I have been on the mini pill for years but have come off it about 3 months ago as a consultant wants to check all my hormones without the mini pill in my system.
My oestradiol is very low, my cortisol is high and my prolactin is high.   I am not pregnant. I sweat a lot. I have put on weight around my face. I was underweight my whole life until 2018 when I suddenly put on a stone. I just have to look at food and I put weight on. I keep getting spots and a bit of rashes around the breast area. They have also gotten bigger and hurt half the time. I get head pain mainly in between the eye area at the front of the head. I sometimes see dots in my vision.

hlpb91,Lump on chest. What is it?,"https://imgur.com/a/4JOBUSQ

https://imgur.com/a/gbjhEwq

39, male, lives in South Florida.

I have a lump on my chest that appeared on Thursday around noon.  It’s kinda weird, because I used the toilet and it wasn’t there.  Then, as I was taking a shower, I noticed it.

It’s a flat lump, about the size of a quarter, to the left of my right nipple.  I don’t know if it’s a boil.  I don’t see a white head on it but I do believe I see a tiny hole where it’s possible someone would come out.  Or maybe there was a hair there that I may have yanked out accidentally during showering.

It hurt quite a bit on Thursday and prevented me from getting much sleep.  On Friday, I took two ibuprofen and pain went away.  I haven’t take any Ibuprofen since.  I let if soak under the shower with warm water.  And I keep a bandage on it.

Sometimes it does it but only for a couple of minutes.  You can’t really notice the lump (it’s sort of a hard flat lump under the skin) but the lower half of my right boob is a little bigger now.  

Also, last night, just before to bed, and whole right chest area was red.  Tonight, it’s just red around where the lump is.

What do you think it is?  Should I see a doctor immediately?  If so, should I go to my GP or to a dermatologist?

hlpklc,Can Anyone Help Me Understand What Happened to my Dad?,"My 64 year old dad passed away 8 weeks ago from colon cancer.

Everything happened so fast that I am not sure I understand exactly how this happened, and I am hoping someone with more knowledge about cancer can help explain things.

Basically, my dad had never gone for colon cancer screenings (I know this is not good but he was one of those people who do not go to the doctor much). This time last year, in July, he was perfectly healthy except that he had a lot of gas. Not pain or bloating, just gas. Sometimes trapped gas that would go away. We all assumed it was a consequence of getting older or food intolerance, and since he had no other symptoms we never considered it alarming.

In October-November, my dad started getting bad insomnia unrelated to the gas. By December, I noticed he had lost some weight, but he had also stopped eating junk food and started walking every morning so we figured it was a result of this. 

In January, he had some constipation on and off and complained of hip pain. He had these symptoms from January until March, on and off. He continued to lose weight, but lived normally and continued to be active, had a normal appetite, etc. Finally, after I begged him for a month to see a doctor, he saw one in mid-March. He had a routine blood test that revealed bad liver counts (elevated ALP) that my doctor said was gallstones. He was scheduled for a non-urgent ultrasound to investigate this. 

The ultrasound was at the beginning of April, and this is where everything sped up and with COVID, we were unable to be there with my dad for most appointments. The ultrasound showed his liver was full of masses, and a CT scan the next day showed cancer in the colon. Lungs were clear, hip was clear. Still, he was referred non-urgently for follow-up at a cancer centre, and our doctor said he could possibly have chemo and surgery for the liver. This gave us what proved to be false hope. 

However, two weeks later, before he could be seen at the cancer centre, his behaviour got strange - paranoia - and he became too weak to walk. We had him admitted to the ER, and they did another CT scan which showed cancer not only in the liver where the ALP tripled since a few weeks earlier, but in the lungs, both adrenal glands, and two tumors in the brain. The doctors were all shocked at how widespread the cancer was, but said with treatment he would have 6-18 months. He had brain surgery, and was scheduled for follow-up, but his doctors refused to give him chemo or radiation and did nothing to address the liver tumors. He passed away a couple weeks later and less than a month after the masses were found in the liver. We couldn't be in the hospital with him because of COVID but they had promised to let us visit when it was close to the end. But the end came so suddenly that we were not informed until after it happened.

What I want to know is, why did this all happen so quickly? Everything I have read about colon cancer says that even at stage 4 it is slow-growing, and life expectancy can be many months. How could he not have cancer in the lungs or adrenal glands weeks earlier and then suddenly have cancer there? Why did his doctors give up on him so quickly and not immediately help his liver when the ALP was rising so quickly and he was getting swelling from liver failure? Why was he referred non-urgently if the liver was so quickly being destroyed by tumors? Why did they say 6-18 months when he passed in less than one? Why was his decline - weight loss and weakness especially - so quick once he was in the hospital? What was the ultimate cause of death and why was it sudden? Is it common to find colon cancer in such an advanced stage?

Because of COVID, nobody ever followed up with us about how all of this happened so fast and so aggressively. I had done so much research about colon cancer and the many chemotherapies and treatment options, and I am heartbroken and angry that my dad did not get a chance to try a single one when it seems like EVERYONE is given standard chemo and biologics and radiation, even just for palliative care. I really feel like the doctors went from saying it wasn't urgent, to giving up on him, with no in-between. I am so angry we got no chance to fight this, and I am so sad he had to come to terms with his mortality so quickly after being given false hope at longer survival. Why did this all happen like this, and is it common that colon cancer give no symptoms until it is everywhere?",22,19,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hlpklc/can_anyone_help_me_understand_what_happened_to_my/"")",2020-07-05 09:38:11,Physician Responded

hlpw22,64 year old teacher with heart condition; is it safe to go back to the classroom?,"I am writing this on behalf of my mother; she doesn't have a Reddit account but she knows that I am writing this and has confirmed all of the medical information. 
My mother is exactly 64.5 years old today. She has a BMI of 24, and she takes simvastatin and metoprolol. She has a history of major heart issues. She has SVT, which is currently under control thanks to a pacemaker and two ablations. Three years ago, she was in heart failure. She is currently no longer in heart failure, but her ejection fraction is at the very lowest end of the normal range. 

My mother works as a middle school teacher. She is passionate about and committed to her job, and while she could afford to retire,she likes having a full salary and working towards a more generous pension. She taught online in the spring—I'm a biased observer, but she worked damn hard at it and did a good job—but her school district is planning to reopen in the fall. Teachers have been informed that they must wear masks but students will not be required to do so. I have been to her school: it is old, crowded—even if they institute staggered sessions, students will not be very spread out—and poorly ventilated. They recently had a ""socially distanced"" graduation that was an utter shitshow of students, parents,  and even faculty and administrators mingling in close proximity with no masks. I am very afraid that any ""safety measures"" her school enacts will be window dressing rather than meaningful risk mitigation. (For instance, they are making a big deal about disinfecting surfaces, which to my mind is like making a big deal about installing better seatbelts in a car that has no brakes.)

My mother is not convinced that she is at heightened risk of dying or suffering major health consequences from COVID. I think she is gambling her life and long-term health if she returns to in-person instruction in the fall, and she should retire and find work tutoring online if she wants the extra cash. I understand that schools are necessary for a functioning society—I'm a teacher too, in a different school, and I'll be masking up and going back to work in the fall, partly because I need the money but also partly because teaching is my job and *goddamnit I'm going to educate the next generation or die trying.* But in my case, ""die trying"" is mostly just hyperbole: I'm younger, I don't have a heart condition, and my school seems to be more committed to meaningful prevention. 

So, doctors of Reddit, here's the question: If my mother were your mother—and you loved her very much and didn't want her to die—what would your advice be? Is my mother at elevated risk of dying from COVID? She won't listen to me, but maybe she'll listen to you.",1,3,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hlpw22/64_year_old_teacher_with_heart_condition_is_it/"")",2020-07-05 09:57:00,Physician Responded

Hello Docs / Peeps,

About 2 or 3 weeks ago I went out for a walk, I went through a little nature trail. When I got home that evening I realised that a red rash had appeared on my hand.

[What it looked like when it first appeared](https://imgur.com/P8DxWEB)

It was not swollen and I couldn't see any venom/sting or entry points. It was just rather itchy! Two weeks later and It is still here, I have put aloe vera on it today.  It is still just as itchy but paler in colour, the centre can turn white/darkish when itched.

[What it looks like today (+2/3 weeks)](https://imgur.com/pJjgTSD)

Just curious to know what sort of rash this is? I think it may be a reaction to a plant or something but curious because of the length of time it has remained on my hand!

For a couple years I've been having bouts of sensitivity/irritation inside my mouth and on my lips and became allergic to many new things.  About 1 year ago I started getting these \~1mm bumps on my lip, usually just one or maybe two at a time, with a teeny pinprick-sized area in the center with a tiny bit of yellow fluid.  They're a bit sore/itchy if I wipe them but other than that don't bother me.  They show up without warning and generally I first notice it when I feel the bump when licking my lips/brushing teeth, etc.  They don't really turn into scabs just stay a bump for a  week or two then eventually fade.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had type-specific blood tests for HSV multiple times over years and they have come back negative.  I've never had one swabbed because the clinic says there is not enough fluid.  I was told it's not herpes/cold sores if if it doesn't tingle, fill up with more fluid, or scab over but I don't understand what else these could be or why I keep getting them.

But now my wisdom teeth broke through. Just a small corner and I can really feel them pressuring against my other teeth. In that time my eye problems got worse and I have a lot of headaches that origin in my jaw and then move to the rest of my head and neck. 
Could those to be connected?
The headaches and vision problems get especially worse when I play with the corner of the tooth that’s already out.

Somehow I am freaked out that all of those symptoms could have a different origin than my wisdom teeth.

hlsbyj,Does this look like an infected hair follicle or something else?,"Hi. I’m very anxious about this. Friday night when I was showering I felt a pain when water hit my vagina the external area. I shower twice a day so I know it wasn’t there or wasn’t as tender in the morning. When I looked it was a bump that was dark like it had blood inside of it and a hair was growing out of it. I pulled the hair out and it burst so all the blood that was under it came out. I washed  the area put ointment on it and after about an hour the area was flat so no more bump and it wasn’t tender. It hurt but just like how a cut hurts. Next day it just looked like a flat cut but no scab. Does this sound more like an infected hair follicle or is it possible it could be a herpes?

hlsf2y,Worrying signs from my dad,"Hello, my dad 55M (6’0 230lb Caucasian, takes thyroid medicine daily because he had his thyroid removed in 09 due to thyroid cancer and takes BP meds for high BP)  has recently showed signs of maybe some mental regression and I’m starting to worry that it could be something worse.  It all started recently and rapidly, he’s aware of it a bit too.  I realized it recently playing a game with my daughter in which you need fast reflexes, not only was he know where near fast enough for the game he kept forgetting the order of the game or what the cards meant.  He recently noted to me how he couldn’t keep up with a movie he was watching and he said “I guess it was just moving too fast for me”.  He also mentioned that physical activity at work has been hard on him but he guesses it’s from the heat and nothing more.  He has remained rather active thanks to cycling and his job is rather low on the physical work. so I don’t know if I believe the heat is making anything worse.  One think to note (and also the most recent thing that worried me) is that he’s getting a “suspicious” mole removed which is actually in his hair on his head.  He had to shave around the mole and otherwise cut his hair very short so the shaved spot didn’t look ridiculous. When I saw the new cut I said “another hair cut?” And he was confused because he said he hasn’t gotten a hair cut recently.  He actually has and we would joke that it was an “illegal haircut” since all the barber shops have been closed due to Covid, so forgetting that actually concerned me enough to think into these issues more.  Now the mole he’s having removed was described as “not overly concerning” by his doctor.  I would say he gets one removed every other year since he had melanoma back in 2004, and goes to the dermatologist every 6 months to get checked.   Part of me worries that it could be connected but that’s doesn’t seem right.  So I guess I’m asking if anything I’ve mentioned so likes anything concerning.  There’s no family history of diseases that we know of. I don’t live with my parents but I still see him about once a week and have noticed all this within the last month, my mother, on the other hand, would be too hard to ask if he’s shown other similar issues as she’s a very hysterical person and she’ll think the worst, so I’m hoping to get help here, before continuing further.

I have to run and get salt for him to consume and that's the only way it stops. He has an incredibly high pain tolerance so the fact that it puts him out to that point is frightening. He says that his father has the same problem. I carry salt packets in case this happens when we are out. We have had to stop bike rides for him to lay on the ground until we can resolve the issue. I feel like there has to be some sort of underlying mechanism. It happened again for the first time in months a few moments ago, right after we had pho which is already super salty.

Long story short, my fiancee and I were out on our back porch watching fireworks last night when we noticed a Small Brown Bat kinda dragging itself across the ground. I didn't think anything of it and went inside to grab some water, when I came back outside I had assumed it was gone. I started leaning up against the brick wall when I heard a climbing sound next to my right arm. I jumped and saw that the bat I saw earlier was climbing the wall. I didn't think I got bit, but upon reading the CDC guidelines I went to the ER to get post vaccinated out of an abundance of caution, however the doctor checked me out and said he didn't think I needed the vaccine and sent me home without it.

The bat was gone when I left to go to the ER, roughly an hour after the encounter, so I'm assuming it flew off. I personally think it was just a young bat who got scared from the fireworks and tried to take shelter under our porch, but once again, due to the CDC guidelines I decided to take an abundance of precaution.

I was surprised when the ER Doctor told me that, despite the CDC guidelines (they make it pretty clear on thier site that any encounter with a bat means that, that person should start the post-vaccination process), I didn't have any bite marks/didn't feel any bites so I didn't need start the post-vaccination process.

""The ethmoid sinuses are markedly expanded but clear. The nasal septum is bowed to the right with a superimposed right bony nasal spur. Marked narrowing of the superior nasal cavity is seen, due to hyperexpanded ethmoid air cells and mild mucosal thickening. The temporomandibular joints demonstrate degenerative changes bilaterally.""

I have severe Morton's Neuroma in both feet. All the standard symptoms, had them for nearly 10 years now (though they used to be much more manageable). Mom had one in her right foot and had it surgically removed. The surgeon said hers was the size of a peach pit. Mine are large enough to feel with your fingers.



I do as much as possible to keep my feet happy: had orthotics as a teen, wore only wide toebox shoes, never really wear high heels. But I live an active lifestyle, my job is as an instructor for an adaptive sports organization. I ski/snowboard nearly every day in the winter. In the summer I work with horses and go hiking and rock climbing. Literally every single one of these activities leaves my neuromas angry and and inflamed. Riding and skiing are the worst. I think because so much weight is on the ball of my feet?

I got custom footbeds made for my ski boots. Didn't help. Saw my podiatrist. He suggested doing less activities. Says he doesn't ""believe in"" Neuroma surgery, that it doesn't work. I am in so much pain and I've tried everything. The cortisone shots make things worse rather than better. Footbeds with metatarsal cushions make things HORRIBLY painful for me. I need to get on top of this before winter. What do I do? There's no other podiatrists in town. Is there another specialist I can see?

It is a constant feeling like there is a weight on my chest making it hard to get a full breath. My neck gets so swollen sometimes that my face gets flush and uncomfortable. I am tired all the time. 

My GP seems unconcerned and thinks it is some kind of virus but I am concerned something is seriously wrong with me. I have always been very healthy and never been sick for long. My symptoms have slowly become more constant and severe for going on 100 days now.

hlx3c7,Low grade fever for a few months,"Hello,

So I'm getting a bit confused, almost 3 months ago I got a cold it mostly healed quite quickly, symptoms were very light, like low grade body temperature, runny nose and such, but after that I kept measuring my body temperature, I use mercury in glass kind of thermomether, quite an old one but is really accurate. The only thing that bothers me is from that ilness until now no matter at what time I measure the temperature I always get 36.9 - 37.1 Celsius temp always between that range, I measure temp in the armpits, I don't feel any kind of pain or weakness symptoms, I hit gym hard and feel good, now it's a summer season and it could be that I confuse a hot weather which makes me think that I have a low grade fever, I also get slighty runny nose like watery saliva once or twice a week in the morning but once I spit it out it's gone and no other symptoms. When I was ill I also had a problem to turn my neck to the right, neck pain was intense if I tried moved it and the pain prevented me from moving it, now everything is ok, but I still feel my neck sometimes cracks or clicks too much if I rotate or turn it hard right. Could inflammattion of a neck joint or something cause low grade fever symptoms? I'm not really sure if 36.9 - 37.1 Celsius can be considered low grade fever when measured in the armpits. If it bothers me what tests should I do to find out what's wrong, but mostly I live the normal life and during the day I feel quite energized but at the evenings when everything is silent and calm it feels like it's a little too warm for me.

hlxbue,[19M] Low-grade fever yesterday and increased heart rate,"Hi there. Yesterday afternoon, I felt bad and could tell the onset of a fever. Sure enough, just before the evening, a low-grade fever hit me. I went against my parents' advice of drinking an antipyretic and just drank a lot of water and slept. I had a bit of trouble sleeping. I would constantly wake up at night to pee, and whenever I would stand up, my heart rate would increase considerably. Heck even after lying down and breathing deeply, my bpm doesn't change dramatically. I don't know if I'm just very nervous (I have an anxiety disorder). I'm sweating a lot as I type this for no obvious reason. I don't have any other symptoms like mucus, dry cough, sore throat, etc. Also my fever seems to have gone. There's only one confirmed case of COVID-19 here in my city (but I do live in a developing nation where the government is a failure when it comes to testing, so I bet there's more), and I've been locked inside our house for months, only going out rarely to do some cycling.

I am 19F, 132 lbs, 5'4, South Asian (brown):

Primary complaint is that I have these shallow cuts/marks around my vulva, along with itching and burning upon touch around the area. The cuts themselves are not painful or irritated at all, just the area around them is. No discomfort during sex or urination. It has been going on for about 10 days now. My doctor initially thought it was a yeast infection but my treatment has not resulted in any improvement of symptoms - in fact the itchiness and irritation seems to be getting worse. Also experiencing a very thick, smooth white discharge with no clumps, does not have the typical ""cottage cheese"" consistency that is associated with yeast infections. I have no idea what is causing them and have never noticed them before, nor have I ever experienced anything like this in the past.

\- Been tested for STIs including herpes with all being negative.

\- They started bleeding after I had sex about a week ago (this occurred for the first time)

\- Always use more than enough lubrication during intercourse

\- I'm also on the pill, as well as yeast infection treatment (oral pill + cream)

\- Do not use a condom but only have 1 partner

hlyfl1,Should I see my old Oncologist or my GP?,"23F

So the question is pretty straight forward but there’s a lot of medical history to consider when answering it. I’m just trying to decide if I should see my old Oncologist or if a GP is sufficient. 

In March 2015 as a 17 yr old I was diagnosed with stage 1c Juvenile Ovarian Cancer, I had a granulosa cell tumor on my right ovary. The only reason we found it is because it ruptured. I had my ovary removed and was treated with five rounds of pretty intense chemotherapy (for those that know Cisplatin, Bleomycin, and Etoposide). Looking back on my life we think that I actually had the tumor much earlier, around the time that I was 4 I started having gastrointestinal issues. These ranged widely and changed every couple of years making a diagnosis very hard. To make a long story shorter the stomach issues cleared up post chemotherapy and I was told that’s a common symptom of that particular cancer. I suddenly could eat foods I hadn’t had in years, my bowel movements were regular, and I wasn’t in chronic pain! It was amazing! 

Fast forward to about a year ago, I notice that I’m fatigued a lot, but I’m also working 6 days a week at two jobs and in school so I brush it off. I start having digestive issues again, but I was living on my own and eating very not healthy foods like the college student I was, so I blow that off too. 

Fast forward to March 2020, the pandemic hits the US in its fullest and I move back in with my parents. My job closes since we were non essential and I start eating my mom’s well balanced meals again every day. Except nothing gets better. When I wasn’t working I found that I was still exhausted, and slept on average 10-14 hours every night, I never once woke up naturally before my alarm at 1:00pm despite mostly going to bed between 10-1am or so. Still having digestive issues even though I’m eating well balanced meals. 

I know I need to go to a doctor, these things aren’t normal, but would it be best to get a GP’s opinion or should I schedule something with my oncologist? I haven’t seen my oncologist in a while and it is a pediatric oncologist, but the clinic told me that if I ever needed to see an oncologist again they would take me back as a patient. I don’t want to over react and have the oncology clinic tell me that I need to just see my GP, but I also don’t want to ignore anything that might be important.",1,7,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hlyfl1/should_i_see_my_old_oncologist_or_my_gp/"")",2020-07-05 18:28:54,Physician Responded

hlz42k,Severe testicle pain ( proven not torsion ),"Hey everyone

 Im just hoping for some input, because Im kinda scared and in pain...

Kind of a mediumish long story, so there will be a TL;DR at the bottom.

To start off, Ive been to a Doctor, who left me hanging with out any answers when he closed on the 2nd, 3 days ago. ( and I cant get in touch with him till tomorrow)

Started having severe testicle pain about a week ago. Very severe in the left testicle. I mean enough pain that I was rolling in bed. I went to a Urologist who briefly checked them out, performed a prostate exam, and took a urine sample. He said all looked normal and that he didnt know what was causing the pain. He ordered an Xray to check for bladder stones and an ultrasound to check out my actual testicles. I was told that nothing looked abnormal in either! 

But here I am again, another night in severe pain, where I cant lay down, can barely sit for longer than a minute, and have to pace around the room to feel ANY relief.

Now I just did a check, and Ive found a lump right above my left testicle.

TL;DR: Doctor said it isnt kidney stones, torsion, and all looked normal in an ultrasound and Xray. Im still in severe pain that ramps up EVERY night at about 8 pm.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and Im 30 years old if that matters

I recently found out when she was 33 her “ovaries died” (as she put it). She says she doesn’t remember a specific name of exactly what happened but the general gist of it is her body stopped producing estrogen, so her ovaries stopped working, so she wasn’t able to naturally have a baby or though IVF because she went through menopause right then at 33.

As I’m 28, children have been on my mind and since she was so young when this happened I’m concerned if it’s genetic it may happen to me.

Now everyone is gonna say, is phimosis, I do not believe it is. I made a lot of research and can not find anything that seems to look like what I have. Let me explain.

When I try to retract my penis foreskin, it starts showing a little of the glans, from the top side, then when I look at the bottom part, the foreskin is still in the top of the penis head, when I try to pull that area down the opening (external urethral meatus) and the inner foreskin are **literally stuck** together, there is a piece of flesh connecting them together.

This piece of flesh can not be the frenulum as the frenulum is not close to the meatus, I just don’t understand why is it like that. Is this a condition? I’m sure this cannot be phimosis, as phimosis is tight foreskin not a piece of flesh that makes the top part of the penis stuck to the foreskin.

hmbc0c,Abnormal Blood Test,"23F 5’ 6” 180lbs

Last week I was at the doctor and had my thyroid checked because he said it seemed large. I have had no symptoms of thyroid problems, so this came as a shock.

I was called today and my doctor said that my results were abnormal and he needed to talk to me about it in person. I am going in 2 weeks because I will be out of town and working. He said it wasn't urgent, but I can't help but worry. 

I recently have gained about 15 pounds, but attribute that to lack of exercise and eating unhealthy during quarantine. I also have bouts of feeling tired and sluggish, but that directly relates to my fairly unhealthy lifestyle. It goes away when I take care of myself better, but I have a hard time sticking to habits.  I have PCOS, which (I think) can be comorbid with thyroid problems. 

I am on birth control (Gianvi), spironolactone 50 mg. I am a social smoker and drinker. 

I know without my results it can be hard to give me a clear cut answer, but if anyone has advice on what I can expect that'd be great.",1,7,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hmbc0c/abnormal_blood_test/"")",2020-07-06 09:54:47,Physician Responded

hmbwft,Eye pain returning even after antibiotic drops,"Hi. I'm M23, 215 pounds, don't smoke or drink, not on any medications.

&amp;#x200B;

I started having pain and discomfort in my left eyeball last Monday, June 29th. At first it just kinda felt sore and a little strained, nothing too insane or concerning. I just thought maybe it was tired so I went to bed early and assumed I'd be fine in the morning. Over that week, it just got worse each day. At first it was clear/not red and there was no bump or anything noticeably wrong with it. As it worsened, it started getting red around the bottom half of my eye and the pain got worse, and then come the very painful sensitivity to light. It wasn't a constant pain, but any stimulation (light, moving my eyeball around, touching or pressing, etc) caused a very uncomfortable pain. It became unbearable when I woke up Friday morning (June 26th), and the sensitivity was so bad, I couldn't even look at my phone screen with it on the lowest brightness setting, couldn't turn on the lights, etc. I decided to go to urgent care that day. I was basically told by this doctor that she didn't really know what it was, because it didn't seem to be pink eye (because it wasn't itchy or crusty/matted) but also didn't seem to be anything too worrisome since my vision was clear and normal, so she just came to the conclusion it was probably some type of infection or inflamed and prescribed be some antibiotic-steroid eyedrops that I started taking that same Friday. Upon taking them, I noticed a basically instant relief. The redness cleared up within two days, the pain subsided, and I was no longer sensitive to light. I continued taking these for the 7 days I was told to and stopped this past Thursday (July 2nd). I assumed all was fine and I was in the clear, until last night I noticed a hint of the discomfort and sensitivity returning. I started panicking a little, thinking that it must be something more serious than just a small infection if the pain is already returning. It wasn't unbearable or crazy pain, but I could tell it was starting to come back on. I put in a drop of the eyedrops before bed last night to see if that would help, and woke up and am completely fine, but I'm just concerned that perhaps the eyedrops are just masking a more serious issue? Thoughts?

Notes:

\- I only have vision in my left eye (the one with the issue), which is why I am extra concerned. My right eye is a ""lazy eye"" and basically has uncorrectable vision issues and has since I was a child.

\-Despite all the issues, vision issues in the messed up eye have not yet been a symptom. My vision in that eye has remained clear and normal. The eye has also not been itchy, matted, or had any discharge.

\-I do plan on not putting in anymore drops and seeing how my eye does on it's own over the next week or so, and going to an optometrist in a few days if my eye worsens without drops. I just wanted some advice and opinions from others first.",2,7,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hmbwft/eye_pain_returning_even_after_antibiotic_drops/"")",2020-07-06 10:23:52,Physician Responded

Hey guys, I have been having severe night sweats for over a year now. Hasn't been an issue in the past. Some online info says it is because of my medication, but I have been on these meds for years and have had no issues before now. I've noticed some correlation between the sweats and my menstrual cycle, but not enough to say it is definitive. Also, I seem to sweat more when I have stress dreams that I do when I have normal dreams. Regardless, I have night sweats every night. The worst part is, it smells awful. It seeps into my pillows, my comforter, and my sheets. I don't have the money to afford a whole new bedset for every night of the week, so my poor partner is stuck sleeping in the stink with me. I was tested for diabetes last year when this started and came back with no concerns, but my doctor dismissed my worries that it could be hormone related and didn't test my hormones. What do you think? I stink, my bed stinks, and I am getting chafed in uncomfortable places from sleeping in a puddle of sweat every night. Also, I have tried different blankets of various thicknesses. I still sweat. My house is kept cold.

I was told from a telemedicine appointment to go see a doc for a possible lung clot, but I don't have insurance except to go to the ER. Because of all the corona running around, I'd rather not do that unless I have to.

My symptoms are episodes of chest pain on the right and sometimes left side. The pain can be felt from both the front and the back of the body, so it feels like 'lung pain'. It's often accompanied by shortness of breath. During these flare-ups it can hurt to inhale.

When I'm not 'flaring up', I can still feel the pain at a low level.

I paid out of pocket for a chest x-ray which was clear. 

Does this episodic pattern look enough like a clot / pulmonary embolism to go to the ER, or is this very unlike what a clot would present like and it's not something to worry about ?

hmgb6x,Question about possibly fractured ankle,"Age: 33

Sex: Female

Medications: Klonopin and metoprolol

About 2 hours ago, I tripped down just a few stairs and first my ankle wrenched to the left and I heard a pop, then when I was trying to straighten it out I accidentally bent my foot forward further than it should have gone and heard another pop.  I've broken my ankles, and other bones, and this doesn't feel like that but it does feel like when I had an avulsion fracture on my ankle.  The lack of immediate swelling also looks more like that to me than when I've sprained it before. 

I know it'll be impossible to tell just from pictures, especially because my phone takes terrible quality images, but I was hoping I could get advice on if you think it's okay to just wrap it or should I get an x-ray.  I can bear weight, though it hurts, but can't turn my ankle to the side.  There's also a large, raised blue spot that looks more like a really enlarged vein than a proper bruise.  It's not coming out well in pictures.  Thanks in advance!

Hi everyone,

So two days ago I helped move furniture to a 3rd floor apartment. After carrying a couple of things, I helped my dad with their new dining table which was really heavy. When we were going up the stairs I was aware of how heavy it was but didn't think much of it.

I was out for a few minutes and when I woke up I was pale, sweating a lot, my lips were yellowish and my head felt kinda heavy, it wasn't really a headache though.

I'm not a person who works out and my sleep schedule is a mess since the quarantine started. This is the first time something like this happens to me and under normal circumstances I would've seen a doctor already but most hospitals have collapsed because of corona in my country.

hmhgor,"Female 27, claims body is covered in strings/fibers emitted from eyes - physical or mental?","I'm very concerned about my roommate. I would greatly appreciate any insight into whether her illness is physical or mental and potential remedies.

About a week ago, my roommate told me that she began to notice and feel tiny, sticky ""strings"" entangled in her eyelids. She believes the strings were produced from her eyes. Note that she has a bad habit of rubbing/stroking her eyelids when nervous or anxious which initially led me to believe it was an infection. Since then, she believes that the strings have multiplied in number and have stuck to her hair, arms, back, legs, etc., even so far as wrapping around her toes and fingers restricting circulation.

I'm unable to visually identify these ""strings"", but she is certain that she sees and feels them pull on her eyes, limbs, etc. She obsessively searches her body to eradicate the strings primarily by cutting them with scissors. At one point, she was pinching her arm to ""break the strings"" so vigorously that bruises formed. She has woken me up at night multiple times in a panicked state claiming that she could not feel her hand or leg due to the strings cutting off circulation. Her fingers and legs did not show signs of poor circulation.

She is 28 and is prescribed an antidepressant and 60mg Adderall. I have reason to believe she may be taking more than her prescribed dosage of Adderall which causes her to eat sparingly, sleep poorly, and experience mood swings.

She refuses to see a professional because I made the huge mistake of questioning if it was all in her head in an attempt to calm her.

They came and looked her over. Her blood pressure was very high. 180/ something, I’m sorry I forgot the second number.

Due to covid and our hospital being backed up, they had me take her to the ER next to my apt. I took her over, they did blood tests, looked at her heart and did a non contrast CT. they didn’t find anything. 

Today, she woke up and the headache is persisting. She said originally it was an 8 yesterday as far as pain, and today she said it sporadically throbs with her heartbeat and hurts to like a 3. 

I’m super worried about her, and I’m trying to take all precautions necessary. I know no one can diagnose her, but does anyone have any idea what could be happening? Or where we should go? Should they have done an MRI???

I rolled my shorts down some and it wasnt irritating it as much. I got home and sat down to eat and it kept hurting now without touching it. Looks completely normal and identical to other leg. By bedtime it spread to a 2” area (almost connected to previous area) on my pubic area. It was sore to the touch but also sore without touching it again. Seems to go a little that just skin. I went to bed hoping it would be better but woke up and it was worse. Its now spread to the top of my right thigh, but still in an area all connected to the others. It hurts to do anything. When I touch it, it doesnt feel hot but my cold fingers are burning on the skin. Brushing the skin hurts. Almost feels like the top layer of skin is just raw and open, but it is not. I’ll post a photo if you guys want but its 100% identical to how it was 2 days ago. I’m afraid it will keep spreading. I’m having a hard time googling this because its such a weird / vague symptom.

I recently woke up with what I thought was a spider bite, and all I had really was some itchy red dot w two little bite marks. I was like whatever and carried on with my day. It started to get bigger and become dry in the next few days- it was dry and about.5 inch diameter. it had a slightly raised ring arround the flat dry center. I was like ok weird spider bite and it'll heal soon. 

Then while me and my cat were playing she got a tiny tiny scratch in the center. I was like ok cool maybe that's bad but I'm sure it's fine and didn't pay much attention to it. At about 6-9 days, it's about 1 inch diameter, and was just like a red dry skin patch for a while. But yesterday, it started to leak like a clear sticky liquid. it's pretty gross. no smell though, and no streaking. it's got a crusty outer ring and a flat ish center, but it's all red and leaking clear liquid now. someone said that's part of the healing process- but I'm not so sure. 

Some have said maybe staph or ringworm, but it has not spread, and it's for sure been touched by my boyfriend so I don't think it spreads like that. Originally thought mild brown recluse, and I originally met the criteria through the  ""NOT RECLUSE"" acronym, but now I'm not so sure. it's itchy again and kinda hurts. I'm worried because I can't go to the doctor because of covid. I keep it clean and wash it daily, but I'm not sure if I should keep it that wet. 

Any medical advice woukd be really appreciated I know I should just go to the doctor but I can't. How to clean and take care of it - or even what it might be. I've been a fiend on Google but I'm just tripping myself out.

I was cooking today with a new knife set I just got for my birthday and was about to cut chicken  chicken and went to open a drawer to grab some ziploc bags for the excess  and cut my thigh. It is not super long but I could see under it and it was completely white under and separated and blood pooled  lower before filing up and then dripping. It took 10 minutes 2 gauze pads and I used those white things to get the edges to meet to keep it from seperating(edges would not meet) the cut is no longer than one inch. I used iodine to clean it (with a sterile pad) and a sterile gauze over to keep it covered.

I'm working two part time jobs while studying so I never got insurance through my job and the last of my savings went towards my dogs vet visit last time so I dont want to do anything drastic medically if I do not need too especially because I have lung issues and am trying to stay out of hospitals as much as possible. 

Does this seem like something that needs to be addressed by a doctor or if not what can I do to keep it clean and covered and what warning signs should I look for.  I'm not worried about scaring as I already have others from a rock climbing incident and this is nothing.

Pain is minimal. I have some antibiotic ointments but I have not applied them yet, iodine and can keep it covered and dry if necessary. My work has no sanitation issues and the knife was clean(I just got a new knife set for my birthday and wanted to try them out.

Don't smoke, or use recreational drugs, and drink infrequently. Been taking low dosage Zoloft, and birth control for multiple years with no issues.

For the past month I have been feeling progressively more tired and drained, to the point now of feeling a little weakened by it.

In addition, I have noticed my weight steadily increase over the past month as well, which is VERY abnormal for me. I usually weight in around 100 pounds, and have never really fluctuated from that for over 5 years. I have always wanted to gain more weight as I felt that was a bit low, but no matter what changes I made to my diet or lifestyle, it wouldn't budge.

Now, over this past random month, where I have literally attempted to change nothing, I have suddenly gained 20 pounds.  I don't think this is a bad thing at all, and I am happy with this weight, but I am a little bit concerned as to why I may be gaining this weight all of a sudden.

I have a history of low iron and a suspected case of POS (have had multiple ovarian cysts burst over the years, but tests show inconclusive?). Perhaps my tiredness and weight gain correlate with those?

Is this something I should bring up to my doctor? Or can I chalk this up to something as simple as my body metabolism changing or something along those lines?

My current predicament is me battling through constant joint pain. I can barely walk no longer than 10/30 min at a time. I quit my job because of it. I’ve been trying to get help but currently I have no insurance but I’m working on it. A little bit of background.

Leading up the point where I finally caved in to calling 911, I’ve been having weird symptoms. Like numbness at both of my arms from elbow to hands and sometimes a side of my head. Little burning tingling sensations around my chest area. It varies from time to time. Like today I had it right where my heart is generally at I would think. It’s like a dull tingling burning pain. 
Sometimes I would also have it on both arms around the bicep area.

At the night where I finally called I was about to sleep but then I had a sudden headache come on. I thought nothing of it but then I felt a pressure around my chest. I sat up to try to feel out the pain. The pressure started to get worse and I got up and walked over to my sisters room to try to feel it out some more. Then at that point my heart started to beat super hard like it was going to come out of my chest. Never had that sensation before. Then from there I called 911.

The EMS came and said all my VS were good. Only my BP was high. Around 160/119. 

They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital and I obliged.

Once I got to the hospital it was obvious that people had a feeling that I had an anxiety attack. 
They hooked me up onto and EKG and monitored me for about 8 hours or so. The doctor came back after a few tests and she said everything seems to be alright and that my EKG looked beautiful. 

She suggested me to follow up with a doctor and I’m planning to but my MediCAL is still currently processing and I don’t know what to do in between.

But throughout the days since then I’ve been having small dull pains around where I think it’s a heart attack or something serious. Like dull pain around my jaw, tingling atop my head, pain around both arms, and sometimes pain in the middle of the chest. All dull uncomfortable sensations fortunately.

Since then my eye has stayed this red, I’ve tried different types of eye drops including over the counter antihistamine eye drops, pink eye relief eye drops, and eye drops for redness. My eye looks the worse after I work out because I think sweat gets in it. I think I just scratched my eye but people keep telling me I should go to the urgent care.

I have had no sexual contact with anyone throughout my life, so herpes is unlikely I believe. Even though it’s possible to get HSV 1 without any type of sexual act(drink sharing, etc) the thought of me having herpes is still o the back burner in my brain and I would love some clarification.

Thanks in advance to anyone who has helped me!

hnnajq,CT scan or angiogram for my father?,"Age : 62

Sex : Male

Height : 5'2

Weight : 135 lbs

Race : Asian 

Duration of complaint : No symptoms outside of abnormal stress test (no shortness of breath, no chest pains, no general feeling of ""unwellness"") 

Location (Geographic and on body) : Heart

Any existing relevant medical issues (if any) : high blood pressure, high cholesterol (recent labs show healthy numbers), diabetes, gout, foot pain maybe from diabetes


Current medications (if any) : unknown at the moment

&amp;nbsp;

My dad went in for a few heart tests and his stress test came back abnormal.  The cardiologist suggested he have an angiogram done to see if there are any obstructions.  The cardiologist had also said that a coronary CT angiogram (CCTA) was a possible alternative, but that he would recommend the angiogram because it would let him insert stents if there are any obstructions seen and because the amount of contrast dye used would be less than the amount used in a CCTA.  The cardiologist had said the contrast dye used in both procedures is hard on the kidneys and my dad's previous Creatinine, ISTAT test had shown abnormal results, so he would prefer the angiogram.  If something was seen via CCTA, an angiogram would be necessary anyways, so going forward with the angiogram would limit the amount of contrast dye to which my dad would be subjected and would just be more efficient.   

&amp;nbsp;

My dad was apprehensive about the angiogram still, so the cardiologist sent my dad in for blood work to see if his kidneys were functioning well enough to handle the amount of contrast dye expected with a CCTA.  My dad had a basic metabolic panel and a lipid profile done, and everything came back normal.  My dad's Creatinine was 1.18 mg/dL and his GFR was &gt;60 ml/min/1.73m2.  With the results of the blood tests back, the cardiologist's nurse explained that the CCTA was now suggested over the angiogram because it is the less invasive option and the risks are much more minimal compared to an angiogram.  


&amp;nbsp;


When I had talked to the cardiologist prior to my dad having his blood work done, he had explained that angiograms had a very high success rate with a very low chance of complications.  He had said that the potential complications would obviously be more dangerous than the potential complications with a CCTA, but that they were very uncommon and the benefits (being able to insert stents/clear obstructions and using a lesser amount of contrast dye) of an angiogram were worth it.  I am now worried that maybe there was something lost in communication and that maybe an angiogram would still be the more suitable procedure and he is just letting us know that a CCTA would be viable if we still were not comfortable with an angiogram.  Basically, I am worried that perhaps the angiogram is still the more suitable procedure for my dad, but the cardiologist is assuming my dad is only willing to undergo the CCTA now that the blood work shows his kidneys can handle it.  


&amp;nbsp;


We are in the process of setting up another video appointment to talk to the cardiologist.  I will ask if the cardiologist can confirm that he now believes the CCTA is the recommended procedure and why his recommendation has changed.  

Can any physicians/medical professionals offer any information on the pros and cons of a CCTA vs an a coronary angiogram?",1,6,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hnnajq/ct_scan_or_angiogram_for_my_father/"")",2020-07-08 12:09:22,Physician Responded

ho6d84,Undescended testicle affecting height?,"Hey there, I'm 16, Male, and a Filipino. I am currently 161 cm or 5'3 I guess, and I just found out that I have an undescended testicle. I was born 8 months old, and CS. I don't know these terms well and my English might not be that good so please, forgive me. Anyway, when I was born, my mom told me that hours after I was born, she was very woozy from the anesthesia and couldn't understand anybody, so the doctor wouldn't be able to tell her anything. However, neither my grandparents nor my father told me about an undescended testicle. This was years ago, so we don't know where that doctor (who was supposed to do that scan thing for newborn babies) is anymore, and we can't ask him/her anything. My father is 5'8 ½, and my mother is about 5'0. 5'8½ would be considered remarkably tall here in the Philippines, and that's why I'm worried that I might not get as tall as my dad. I read a post here some time ago that a guy, who was 18, was still 5'3 and concerned that his undescended testicle might somehow be connected to it. I can't really see any doctor/urologist or anyone right now because of the current situation in our hospitals. Do I really need to get this looked at or maybe even undergo surgery? Can anyone tell me any tips on how to grow taller, or maybe (hopefully not) that this might be my final height? I reaaally don't want to stay 5'3 as an adult, and that would be quite disappointing on my father's side.

hobv7o,Benadryl for flying,"Hey docs, 

I get mild to moderate anxiety when flying, so I usually take a couple benadryl to get me sleepy before the flight. I've been taking 50mg (2 pills) the last few flights and it seems to make me somewhat sleepy once the plane levels off, but not quite enough to knock me out. I should also mention I'm a pretty big guy, 6'2"" (1.86m) and 250lbs (113kg) and a lot of times it seems like I need a bit higher than the average dose for an adult for most medicines (but that might just be me making that up, I know nothing about how drugs work).

I'm wondering if it's safe to bump up the dosage to knock me out, and if so, how much is safe to bump it up to. It's a 3 hr flight so i don't need to be out, long I'd just like to sleep for as much of that 3hrs as I can. Also the flight is tomorrow so I don't have time to see my doc for his advice or get prescribed anything stronger, I just have the benadryl.

Sex -- M

Height -- 5'8""

Weight -- 265

Race -- White

Duration of complaint -- Maybe two months?

Location -- United States

Any existing relevant medical issues -- Overweight, currently losing weight, chronic insomnia.

Current medications -- Venlafaxine

Detailed description --

I've been on venlafaxine (an antidepressant/antianxiety medication) for roughly a year, I think.

One of the withdrawal symptoms is dizziness and brain zaps.  I've experienced this before from when I've missed days, but lately I've been occasionally getting these symptoms even though I haven't missed any doses.

It also seems like it gets worse if I'm particularly aggravated by something, but whether the aggravation causes the brain zaps or the brain zaps causes the aggravation is hard to say.

I'm not able to see my GP, unfortunately, because I might have had exposure to Covid 19.

I have no idea if this is relevant, but just to give a little more context, I am overweight and currently successfully losing weight and exercising.  I also have an irregular sleeping schedule due to chronic insomnia, but I generally get enough sleep even if it's at weird times.

My doctor's office over the phone said to make sure I'm well-hydrated.  Is there anything else I can or should be doing?  All results I've seen online are for people that are going off their meds, which is not the case for me.

I'm a software developer, so it's kind of hard for me to do my job if I can't concentrate because of brain zaps.  :\

hqysrj,Cold sore anxiety,"Male 33 non-smoker, 13 stone.  


I was hoping you could give me some advice/information (the internet is a hotbed of disagreeing sources).

I've had cold sores since I was a few weeks old as a baby and get them intermitently (not for a couple of years now I think- they were more common as a kid/teen). I was always very careful once I felt a 'tingle' or had a visible coldsore/a week or so after.

I a couple of years ago found out about asymptomatic shedding and I've become very anxious about passing it to my own eyes and genitals. I've gotten to the point where I'm avoiding touching my eyes altogether and get anxiety when other things are touching my eyes and geneitals i.e. when putting a T-shirt on after holding it I'm trying to make sure it doesn't 'slide' across my eyes. Worried about my glasses which I've held pressing against the side of my eye etc Washing my hands/eyes a lot during the course of the day.  


What are the risks/chances that I'm going to self-infect other body parts when asymptomatic and just going about my daily life? (I don't think its very high given its just the last couple of years I've worried about this stuff despite havinng the infection my whole life- I'm in my 30s).

hqytv9,17M Anxiety issues because of ear acne treatment,"Hi,

Because of my anxiety and OCD I have developed mild tinnitus and I'm very protective of my hearing.

However, a bit of the lotion seeped into my ear by accident, but I'm VERY stressed out and very scared because I'm scared that I gave myself worse tinnitus. I cleaned and dried the liquid in my ear, but maybe the damage has already been done. Or is it because of the stress that this is causing me?

Can salicylic or azelaic acid cause tinnitus???

Meds: lamictal and klonopin 

Situation: Today I went to donate blood. Found my hemoglobin to be a lil low, 9.8. 

For the past week I’d been loading up on iron heavy foods because I thought my levels might be a little bit low. I thought several tons of spinach and more soy than a body should have would give me the boost I needed to be, like, 13 or something more reasonable so I’d qualify (stupid, yes, but I’m high key desperate for that sweet antibody test). 

Of note: I’ve been feeling like absolute trash for the last chunk of my life. Incredibly low mood/energy, more frequently episodes of depersonalization/realization, and a general constant dizzy/far-away feeling. There are many instances I feel like I’m going to pass out if I stand too quickly or sit in one place too long. I assumed this was due to my blood sugar or something insignificant and let it pass. 
I also have frequent chest pain. Every strip they’ve run is normal. My rhythm is great. I’ve learned anemia can cause this. Previously thought to be anxiety. Maybe a combination? 

I don’t have heavy periods (they are rare and light) and this would be the first time I’ve donated blood. 

Now that I know I’m rather anemic, I’m a bit concerned with the symptoms I’ve been having. Getting out of bed is hard.  Living is hard. I am exhausted constantly and find myself falling asleep or able to fall asleep damn near anywhere. 

I’m wondering if a lot of my crappy mood could be due to my body being derived of oxygenated blood, maybe? I feel like a lot of my health is likely linked to the anemia that’s likely due to me being a really terrible vegetarian. 

Questions: 
1.) Can a hemoglobin of 9.8 be safely managed at home with a daily dose of 65mg iron and maybe a change in diet? Along with tracking of my general feeling of health? 

2.) Do I need to be worried? It isn’t classified as severe anemia at this time, but I think if I were to have my levels tested after reverting back to my not so iron heavy diet that it could potentially be much lower. 
I’ve reached out to my health clinic for an appointment but no one has gotten back to me. Do I need to go into an urgent care? Or am I alright to wait potentially weeks for an appointment?

Only medical history is I was anemic years ago due to anorexia but have since fixed that. Im generally in good shape and workout 4-6 days a week.


I have been putting off getting my wisdom teeth removed for years, but now my top right one is coming through my gum, and I’d like the get them all removed, since I heard it’s possible for it to get infected if you leave it like that.  

The problem is, I live in south Florida, which is a huge hotspot for COVID, and on top of that, the people that I work with are *not* social distancing (still going to bars, traveling out of state, etc). This obviously makes me likelyhood of coming into contact with it higher.

My concern is that if I do get them removed, and then end up getting COVID right after, my immune system will be a little weaker from the anesthesia, or painkillers, or just in response to having the surgery, which could potentially make it more dangerous. 

Does anyone have any advice on where to go from here? Am I overthinking the dangers of simply getting teeth pulled, or is this a legit concern? 

Thanks for any help!

I also have a tendency to grind my teeth which led my dentist to ask whether I had a very stressful job. I have a twitch affecting one of my eyebags several times a day.

I had on some sunscreen but didn't realize that I had so much sun exposure when the sun moved away from my umbrella coverage. It took about 6 days for the sunburn to blister, but it did eventually form lots of small blisters (around July 8). Starting July 11 (last Saturday), my sunburn started peeling. From Friday through Sunday I applied aloe and hydrocortisone cream to help with the itching from my skin peeling. Sunday night, I applied some Cetaphil lotion to the peeled areas to help moisturize the area. When I woke up yesterday morning, I had a rash where I applied the cetaphil. It is only getting worse. It burns and itches like crazy.

It's worth noting that I used the same container of Cetaphil that my boyfriend uses who recently had a skin infection of some sort, so it's possible whatever he had transferred to me. I have been applying a thin layer of Nystatin cream as well as neosporin for the past 24 hours but it's not helping. Is there anything else I can try to alleviate the burning and itching?

hr3cn3,Over 40 specialists I've seen can't help me - It's been 5 years now. What is happening? Desperate for answers!,"30 year old female, 145 lbs, 5'8. 

Any help is incredibly appreciated as I'm desperate. I will be detailed as possible recounting everything. 

In December of 2015, I woke up with intense head pressue and under-eye swelling. Made an appointment w/ regular doctor. From there, I've had many refferals. The pressure and under eye swelling got more intense while I slept. I would wake up with my brain feeling like it was on fire. After standing up for a bit, the pressure dissipates. This makes sleeping utterly impossible. If I am not upright, I'm in severe brain pain. Fast forward to 2017, I meet my rheumatologist. She Dx's me with Sjogrens syndrome. I have all the classic symptoms. Joint pain, exhaustion, dryness,  numbness. I explain in depth to her everything happening. She cannot make a correlation between the Sjogrens &amp; what I'm experiencing. She monitors me, but that's about it.


Many testing/refferals later and second, third and 8th opinions, this is who I've seen and what I've had done within the last 5 years:

• ENTs, nasoscopies, ear checks. Nothing abnormal.

• Neurologists - nothing abnormal found. MS/ALS ruled out

•Optometrists - everything looks normal 

•Opthamologists - everything looks normal

• ER visits, suspected autoimmune (clinical Dx)

• Special 'blood' doctors that were referred to me by friends. No help and $700 later. 

• Regular Primary Care Doc - bloodwork normal minus a speckled pattern positive ANA. He doesn't think this means anything really. 

•6 MRIs, with &amp; w/o contast - normal

• 4 CT scans - normal 

•Dermatology/Allergists - skin scrapings/patch testing/punch biopsies.





I'm leaving some other Dr's/testing out,  but this is off the top of my head. I've begged, but my regular pcp does NOT want to do a lumbar puncture.

If anyone can offer some input or advice, I'd be eternally grateful. My eyes have now been almost swollen shut when waking up. Whichever side I sleep on, that's the side that will be affected more. It looks like styes, but isn't. They are little nodules under the skin that remain after the swelling goes down. This is accompanied by the brain burning. One does not happen without the other. I will try &amp; attatch some pics. Thanks for reading!




Edit: Thank you so much everyone, I really appreciate all the replies and helpful advice! I know the eye swelling looks pretty bad/uncomfortable, and don't get me wrong it is! However, the head pressure is what's really doing me in. I can never sleep more than 5 hours a night before my brain feels like it'll explode and I have to sit up right. I would do anything for a good nights sleep at this point because I'm in a constant state of fatigue throughout the day.",180,234,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hr3cn3/over_40_specialists_ive_seen_cant_help_me_its/"")",2020-07-14 08:16:20,Physician Responded

Since COVID, we hadn't had sex (so 3 months). This week was the first time since and my partner noticed these. They were not there prior to quarantine.

They are itchy, and they make sex very painful.

I had a pap smear and pelvic exam literally in January and they did not mention these. Had an appointment my regular Dr and she said she did not see any bumps or anything in my vagina when I had my pap smear and they were not in my chart at all so they are quite new. She is referring me to a vulvar specialist but I won't see her for weeks.

5'5"", 200lbs

Caucasian

Location of problem: Lower abdominal and pelvic area

Duration of complaint: Three days 

Medical problems: Interstitial Cystitis, endometriosis. I've had a hysterectomy in 2015 but kept both ovaries. In 2017 I had a dermoid cyst in my left ovary and my doc removed my left ovary but kept my right intact. 

Current meds: amitriptyline, Lexapro, Prazosin, Buspirone, Elmiron 

I don't drink, I don't smoke cigarettes, but I do smoke weed. No other recreational drugs


Primary complaint: Three days ago I was using a dildo and I think I must have used it too vigorously. Immediately after my entire lower abdominal area was cramping with horrible throbbing pain. My right ovary felt like it might explode. It's been three days since and my lower abdominal area and pelvic area feel like I was beat with a bat. My ovary is still throbbing and any time I move I feel like I might collapse from the pain. It feels worse than any period cramps I ever had before the hysterectomy. I have an appointment with my OB on July 20th. Is this something I should call and tell them to try to get in sooner, or should I just wait it out?

I called a doctor and I was prescribed some anti-swelling medication that seemed to work, it lessoned and seemed to go away for a bit. 
Now it has returned and began to form on my other big toe. After some research, I’ve found that what I have aligns much more with “overgrown toe skin” than an in grown toenail. The nail itself is very normal but the skin on the sides has begun to rise upwards. 

How may I go about treating this? All I can find online is a surgery wherein they cut off the excess skin. I naturally would like to avoid this.

hr5ee3,Is insurance obligated to release drug test results from hospital to employer?,"32M, 5’ 10’, 




Hey all,

So last week I took a ride in an ambulance to the local hospital, I was experiencing one of the horrible panic attacks I get every now and then and couldn’t calm myself. Family member ended up calling ambulance against my wishes but they arrived.

Got to hospital and they hooked up because I was dehydrated, in addition they took urine and blood samples for “testing.” I can only assume these “tests” would include a drug screen.

So here’s my issue.

I’m a daily weed smoker (95% of the time it works to relieve my anxiety). I have a full time warehouse job that only drug tests upon injury.  I have health insurance with the company, however upon realization that they might be doing a drug screen while I was at the hospital I elected to leave on my own before I gave my insurance information.

My question is: the hospital and ambulance are requesting insurance information for payment. Since I am pretty positive that the drug test in the hospital came up positive, would I be a complete fool to list my insurance information to them? Do they have an obligation to report to your employer or insurance company if they find anything illegal in your system?

I really don’t want to be stuck with the hospital bill for the panic attack, but if it’s going to be something that costs me my job I would rather just let the bill go.

I figure it might be a wart, but I'm not entirely sure. It hurts a little when I apply enough pressure straight on to it, and has a coarse texture to it. It rises above the skin approximately 2-3mm. It's quite annoying if I may add, and is very ugly. I have not yet seen a doctor yet, just because of convenience. I'm curious what your thoughts are, if I should go see a doctor, or if this can be remedied at home.. Thanks in advanced.

Two nights ago, it went back to watery and now it’s between watery/loose with mucus. I now generally go 5-7 times a day. Sometimes it’s a medium amount and sometimes it’s small. 

After I go to the bathroom, I feel fine. Sometimes I have stomach cramps, sometimes not. The color has varied from pale brown, brown, to orange. It’s now brown. I’ve been tired off and on, but I’m on my period. My appetite has decreased. 

What could this be? Could it just be the tea interacting with my gut and it’s way too strong? Could this have to do with the antibiotics? Someone mentioned possibly c-diff and that frightens me. Could it be that?

hr639t,Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,"18, Male, 5'10, 68kg

After going to a chiropractor I have been diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome through excessive use of a keyboard. The area affected includes my pinky finger, half of my ring finger and my palm on that side of the hand. 

Although I now know what is going on, I still have a few questions that I thought could be answered on here.

1) I have taken a break from my computer for a few weeks now but still have slight numbness in the area - is this normal? How long does this last usually? 

2) Is there any particular braces that have been known to work any better than other - if so which ones? 

3) I have been applying an ice pack a few times per day and massaging the area aswell - is there anything else I could do alongside this to help recovery?

(disclaimer: a bit gross, so pls read with caution, sorry)","(26F) Yesterday when I was going for a run, a bug flew into my eye. This happens quite frequently, but this time it started hurting very badly, immediately. This is really unusual because usually there's only mild discomfort for like a couple of seconds. It hurt so bad I had to stop; I got out my phone camera and managed to fish it out with some difficulty (gross, I know, sorry). It looked like the typical type of small bug that flies into your eyes - maybe slightly bigger and brown colored, rather than black. Anyway, usually the discomfort goes away right away when you get it out, but it just kept hurting, this sharp stinging type of pain. The next morning it still hurts and the eye looks a bit irritated - particularly one spot (where I'm guessing the bug hit?). I rinsed the eye with water and sort of examined it. There were several blobs of clear, jelly-like fluid (which I have never seen before) that I managed to fish out of the bottom and corner of my eye and I rinsed it again, but it still hurts! Can anyone tell me what the problem might be? It's probably just irritated, but my family has a history of blindness, so I take eye-related issues very seriously.

Hi, I fell off of an e-scooter and landed on my right knee and felt immense back pain afterwords. 1 day later I started feeling pure numbness on my Right big toe and loss of sensation on the top of my right foot along with the ankle.

History: Was diagnosed with Broad right disc protrusion at L5-S1 last year, and had sciatica along with it in which pain went down my right leg. I do not have these symptoms anymore and have recovered from it.

My question is why do I have such bad foot drop and right toe numbness without much back pain. Is it the L5-S1 injury that got worse or can it be disc herniation at L4/L5? What will the recovery time be like and what kind of exercises can I do to get rid of this debilitating condition that's making me limp while I walk.

Male/21/2 years smoker/ 1.73M (5'6) / 68 kilos / 150lbs  

For the details im a 21 year old male with a clean medical history, never had surgeries nor have any history of cancer specifically lung cancer in my family. And i want to be in more detail considering that it might be helpfull. My mom had a genetic test to check for genetic diseases there was nothing related to lung cancer. I suffer from heavy OCD and i smoke and also really scared of going to doctors.

Now to get to my question, for the past few weeks, i have been having trouble usually right after having dinner that whenever i breathe i would feel some pain in the area above the stomach and in the lower parts of my chest in the middle. And the pain usually goes away after a few hours of eating.

There is one more thing about this concerning me because my weight changes from time to time im 1.73 Meters (5,67)  some days i weight 68 kilograms and somedays that number is 70. But i have really bad eating habbits of only eating twice a day and not eating for 7-8 hours before sleeping.

Should i go for a medical check or is this something that can go away on its own? and is it possible that it can be lung cancer? These types of controls are very expensive in where i live so i dont want to spend all the money for nothing.  Sorry for any mistakes in my english since its not my mother tounge.

hr8xwz,Possible rare skin disorder??,"TW: trypophobia possible NSFW? (Tagged to be on safe side) 


Hi, this is my first time posting on Reddit so sorry if I’m doing it wrong but I’m really desperate and I don’t know what else to do. I’m aware this is a long read but I’ve done my best to include everything I think might be relevant. I honestly really appreciate you reading this so thanks in advance! If you know any other doctors which might have an idea feel free to share because I’m desperate for answers. 

We live in UK (so NHS) and can’t afford private care. 

Basically, I think my one year old daughter (14 months) has a rare skin disorder. We first noticed little holes on her leg just after her 12 week vaccinations but at the time thought nothing of it. It could be linked but it also could be a coincidence I’m not sure either way and I don’t want this to be an anti-vax argument. Over the next few months it was hard to tell if it was growing relative to her size or not, and we also weren’t to concerned having brought it up to a doctor before and they said come back if she doesn’t grow out of it and didn’t seem concerned either. Eventually we realised it was definitely growing not relative to her size and were obviously then concerned.  And it’s also spreading up around her back and down her leg and then those patches themselves are also growing. 

Going to the doctors since April we have tried anti-fungal and steroid cream and none have worked. We’ve also tried sudocream and moisturiser ourselves which obviously hasn’t worked. We have eventually been referred to a skin clinic (after accidentally being referred to neurologist who ruled out it wasn’t shagreen patches (which we weren’t surprised with as she has no neurological issues at all)) but the waiting list is very long. Anyone else we’ve spoke to has no clue what it is. 

It doesn’t seem to cause her physical pain (she walks, crawls, climbs and runs fine). She doesn’t itch at it. She’s a relatively happy baby most of the time and seems to be doing developmentally really well. (Currently says with meaning around 20 words at 14 months for example). She’s been on track for all her milestones. When she was measured about 3 weeks ago her weight was 27lb and her height 76cm. I think race is mixed   (white British apart from her Great Grandad being Jamaican, and me, my sister and my Mum always put mixed on forms). She has no other medical issues and isn’t on any medication. 

I’ve put pictures with annotations in a google album and attached the link to that at the end. I’m sorry there aren’t more pictures but we didn’t think anything of it till recently and were very busy with personal issues last year. The pictures themselves are unfortunately at different angles but that’s the joy of trying to get pictures with a 1 year old who hates to be still 😂 I’m going to try and take some more HD photos tomorrow on my camera and if I’m successful I’ll update the album. 

The only thing I’ve found so far which looks the closest is nevus comedonicus but she doesn’t have any black bits it’s just white? So I’m not sure if it is that. 

TLDR: weird growing/spreading holes on child’s skin, possible rare disorder, pictures in link, worried Mum looking for answers.

This happened on Sunday afternoon. It is now Tuesday night and my ankle is starting to bruise (see attached picture) I have injured this ankle repeatedly, but this time was way worse than any sprain I have suffered in the past. I was thinking about seeing a doctor at the end of the week. I still can hardly put any weight on my ankle without bad pain.

hr933g,Over anxious parent or cause for concern?,"Aspergers runs in my family (not my partner’s though) and at university they said it was likely I had it too, when assessed for dyspraxia and dyslexia. Due to this I have been looking out for ‘signs’ in my children. The eldest, who this post is about, is 3F. Three and a half to be more exact as they change so much when little, which is also possibly why I’m overreacting.

Today, when getting her hair washed, which she hates because she doesn’t like the water going on her ears, she said the water hurt her ears. The water wasn’t hot and was just poured over her hair from a jug so I have no idea what could be hurting. I’m really perplexed by this and I’m not sure whether to talk to the doctor about it, or whether that’s really overreacting and I shouldn’t really be stressing the nhs GP with anything non urgent in a time like this.

Other things I think about when wondering if my daughter has aspergers.

She covers her ears to loud sounds, lorry passing or the shower being switched on, but then settles down to play in there once in.

She doesn’t get along with her baby sister (the baby just wants to play with her) and seems rather distressed when the baby gets close to her (almost crying sometimes) when it is not on her terms. She tries to hurt her sister to make her go away, bashing her hands with a toy or standing on them, pulling hair, today she slapped her. Thankfully most of the time this does not hurt the baby and never seriously hurts her, just a little bit of crying solved by a cuddle. We are trying to teach her not to do this but progress is slow. On the other hand she does do nice things for her sister unprompted sometimes and has started sometimes saying “ I lost ‘baby name’, I lost daddy” when the baby is sleeping and her daddy is at work which I think is her way of saying she misses them.

Her learning to talk has been slower than the average at her nursery but it wasn’t behind enough to cause the health visitor any concerns. I’m just surprised when the other children talk and they’re using full, well pronounced sentences, while my daughter does a bit more yoda speak and often I have to translate her for other people because she can’t pronounce all her letters yet. Example ‘ I no want I dogurt’ means I don’t want yoghurt. She often does the ‘I no want I’ format. The nursery says she is ahead of the talking kids in some aspects, adventuring, exploring, climbing, bravery.

She has friends at nursery but they seem to take the lead, literally taking her hand and pulling her off to play (which apparently she enjoys) but when she sees children from nursery out and about she’s never been interested in interacting with them at all, admittedly we’ve never met the ‘favourite’ when out and about.

She likes to hit herself in the face with her favourite cuddly toy sheep, this happens not everyday but regularly. It does not hurt her and used to happen a lot more than it does now.

I know the signs of autism can be different in girls than boys and often girls get diagnosed much later than boys as they are better at pretending to be ‘normal’. 

I haven’t really had much interaction with children other than my own, so I’m not sure what is normal and what isn’t. My partner thinks I’m overreacting due to my anxiety disorder, but I also know that everyone says how crucial early intervention is and I wonder, if I had had that, maybe I wouldn’t have the anxiety problems.",1,6,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hr933g/over_anxious_parent_or_cause_for_concern/"")",2020-07-14 13:18:31,Physician Responded

Thank you for everyone who is interested. Just now I noticed a strange small red circle on my leg. The middle is slightly raised and I think it's itchy, although once I take my mind off for a while the itchyness is gone. It doesn't look like a bug bite and I haven't seen a bug in my room, so I'm a bit lost now.

hrayad,"Can I get an opinion on my liver enzyme counts? (GGT, ASL, ALT)","I just received my second bloodtest for my liver enzymes. For transparency, my first test had:

GGT 85 U/L (14-62 normal range)

ALT 59 U/L (&lt;50 normal range)

AST 24 U/L (&lt;35 normal range)

This first test was done after 2 months of abstinence from alcohol. I binge drank once right after the first test, then waited another 2 months again for my second test. The second test is:

GGT 65 (14-62 normal range)

ALT 57 (&lt;50 normal range)

AST 34 (&lt;35 normal range)

I've read that 2-6 weeks that GGT levels should return to normal... but yet, with only 1 instance of drinking and 4 months, I'm still a bit high (particluarly the GGT)... 

I've got a doctor's appointment next week, but I'm not sure what to expect and it's really bugging me. I know I've hurt my liver in the past but I'd like to continue drinking (obviously not as much as I did in the past). What do you think my doctor is going to say, and do yuou have any personal interpretations of my results?

hrbhnf,I have a mole that seems to have changed in color since the last time I’ve looked at it. Should I be worried?,"White 19F, 120 lbs, 5’10”. I don’t smoke, drink, and wear sunscreen every time I go out. [my mole](https://imgur.com/a/V6OJCbN) in question is located on my right upper rear thigh leg. I am prone to moles and freckles, but I don’t sunbathe or go out into excessive sunlight without sunblock on. Last month, I developed a swollen inguinal lymph node on the left side of my pelvis which I had my GP look at—but that is probably unrelated. The only medication I take is the mini pill. 

I noticed that my mole was slightly irregular in shape and the darker portion of the mole got slightly darker since the last time I looked at it. Last summer, I went to the dermatologist—for reasons unrelated to this particular mole—but I had her check this mole anyway and she said that it was normal. However, since then it seems to have changed slightly in appearance. 

Is it normal for this to occur? My mom had melanoma, but I’m aware that it would be unusual at my age. She developed melanoma in her late forties and she no longer has it. 

I just want to get someone else’s more educated opinion for a bit of peace of mind. Thank you.",1,6,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hrbhnf/i_have_a_mole_that_seems_to_have_changed_in_color/"")",2020-07-14 15:27:09,Physician Responded

# 28M , 185, White, Extremely mild essential tremor, No current medications, Moderate drinker, social smoker, infrequent use of cannabis

Duration: Today

Primary Complaint: Today I had a very bizarre experience while working from my computer. Out of nowhere, my vision in my right eye changed. Things weren't exactly blurry, but it seemed as if my peripheral vision had been impeded and it was really difficult to read anything with my right eye. This occurred for maybe 10 minutes after which I left my screen to take a walk. Upon returning my vision seemed better but, but would occasionally seem off and 'blurry' for maybe another hour or so intermittently.

I then developed a pretty strong, but not debilitating, headache behind my left eye. Any time that I coughed, sneezed, or moved my head suddenly, the headache would be amplified both behind the eye and throughout my head. I had that for \~6 hours, though I definitely still feel discomfort if I force a cough.

I have never before experienced such a stark change in vision, and almost never get headaches. Is this something worth being concerned about or addressing urgently? I know the body can be weird, so I'm just trying to make sense of things.

hrd8k0,For Dermatologists: Why Severe Acne Every Summer?,"Typically, Fall, Winter, and Spring, I have mild acne that I get around my period. Usually, it's just blackheads and one or two deeper pimples that take a while to go away but eventually do in a week or two.  For most of the year, my skin is pretty dry and as long as I keep up with an oil-free moisturizer and oil-free cleanser, my skin is pretty healthy and manageable. Every summer, almost like clockwork, starting in June my face breaks out badly on the sides of my jaw and cheeks. The pimples are both solid feeling with visible whiteheads (like something that can be ""popped"") and very deep, painful, with no clear head, and mostly filled with clear fluid (not pop-able), and range everywhere in between. Where there are no red bumps or whiteheads, if you touch the skin, you can feel bumps where acne is developing under the skin. It almost feels like my cheeks and jaw have a totally different texture than my forehead.
No matter what I do, for the past 6 years, nothing seems to work and the only thing that clears up my acne is the change in season (around October). I have tried chemical peels, different prescribed acne creams (tretinoin for about a year) (adapalene for about a year, off for 2 years, then tried for 6 months again), spironolactone for 1.5 years, and many many many over the counter treatments. (The time periods of treatment overlap with the changing of seasons; some were started in winter in hopes to prevent a summer break out; somewhere started in summer in hopes to reduce the breakout and then continued into fall and rest of the year). The closest I've come to effective treatment is with Paula's Choice Clear Extra Strength routine (https://www.paulaschoice.com/clear-extra-strength-travel-kit/066-bundle.html) (link not meant for advertising but for medical reference) But even that has not helped this year. Though my cheeks and jawline are broken out, my forehead and nose remain clear. Below is the link to reference 

https://imgur.com/a/sOG8vvK

If anyone has any idea why this happens, how to prevent it, and how to treat it, I would appreciate any guidance. I have a wedding in Aug and I am a bridesmaid and am really really hoping to have this cleared up at least a little by then.

hrdqky,3 years of vomiting and 60 pounds of weight loss! Every doctor says “I cant find anything wrong”,"To keep this short and sweet, I (F 23) am a registered nurse and have been with my Fiance (M 23) for 7 years. We moved in together into a duplex 3 years ago, and about two months before we moved in (May 2017) he had his first vommiting episode. He was sick for about 13 weeks straight, vomiting every 30mins, no meds ever stopped it or helped, lost 60 pounds. I have looked into whether it could be our house, but ive never gotten sick so i crossed that off.

Multiple ER visits, every doctor saying “I dont know”, and even had to get set up for IV fluids and electrolyte replenishment twice a week. They considered putting in a feeding tube. Finally, in November of 2017, in the Emergency Department at 4am, I requested a HIDA scan. Turns out he had multiple stones (which every ultrasound and CT scan missed) and his ejection function was less than 4%. Emergency surgery was scheduled four hours later on Thanksgiving. The surgeon reviewed all his notes from the last 5 months from ER visits, IV fluids, PCP visits, and ASSURED us that this must have been the problem. When the surgeon did the lap chole, she told me she had never seen such an inflamed gallbladder with that much fibrous scar tissue, and she didnt know how the hell they missed it for 6 months. We left the hospital in high hopes, only to be severly let-down. 

He was sick for a month and a half after the surgery, vomiting every hour or so, and completely unable to hold down any food, and very little liquid. So finally, they referred us to a GI specialist. (Im assuming this all took so long because they all think ‘there is no way this 20 year old guy could be this sick?’) 

We have been seeing a GI specialist for the past two years, and done every test we could think of. Gastric emptying study? Normal. Upper endoscopy? Normal. Blood tests? Normal, with a slightly elevated bilirubin every time. Ct scan/ultrasounds? Normal. 

So they started him on medications. Zofran doesnt work, Metocloperamide doesnt work, Promethazine works slightly sometimes, Omeprazole doesnt do anything. 

The GI clinic finally said when i asked them “What are we supposed to do? What are you going to do about this?” They replied “We have done everything we can think of, we cant help you.” And didnt give us a referral to anybody who could help! I asked and they said “I dont know who can help!” Ridiculous! 
We have seen an allergy specialist - everything was normal there. 

Now my Fiancé is in “maintenance mode”. We spent $20k in the last three years, and no one has been able to help him and now he has a fear and distrust of doctors. Its a battle to even get him to go to a check up with our wonderful primary care doc when he is sick. Our PCP threw out “cyclical vomiting syndrome” “abdominal migraines” or “cannabis hyper-emesis syndrome” and even asked my finace if he had body dysmorphia issues (anorexia/bulimia) 

Long story short, we are now trying Lexapro (escitalopram) as well as the Promethazine to see if it could be a somatic disorder. The nearest GI specialist outside out state is University of Utah, but insurance wont cover the costs. And the nearest Cyclical Vomiting Specialist to us is in Wisconsin, which insurance wont cover. 

Here is the details since I know you Doc’s need more info to help me. 

Male, 23 year old, hx of depression/anxiety (never needed to be medicated), ADD, and encopresis as a child, no other medical history. Smokes a little Marijuana (which he quit for 4 months to see if it was CHS, and it only made him worse and more nauseous) Now taking escitalopram and promethazine regularly.  Eats a very clean diet, with lots of veggies and fruit, animal protein (mainly in the form of fish), and sometimes has a hankering for a McChicken or McDouble Cheeseburger from McDonalds. Will have a glass of wine 3-4 nights a week. 

His episodes start like this. 

Get nauseous/gassy/slight diarrhea. Sometimes food induced, sometimes not. Just a general upset stomach.  Lately its been before stressful events like midterms/finals/family reunions. But he wont say anything about feeling anxious.

He throws up, and for the first 24-48 hours, it is every 30 min, sometimes more. Doesnt get any sleep, cant keep any fluids down. After that period he slows down slightly, throwing up once every hour or every other hour. Hot baths seem to help. From then on, it can be like that for a couple days or for weeks at a time. He almost always is sick End of August to Mid October, and then sporadically throughout the year. 

Then one morning, he will wake up, say he fees better. And have a couple days of rice/applesauce, and extra fluids before he goes back to eating regular meals. There is no warning, not much of a cycle. He is fine for a few days, weeks, months then out of the blue sick again. Im grateful we have been able to keep him at a fairly healthy weight (6’0”, 145lbs.) i watch these episodes happen, so i am positive he doesnt make himself vomit and he is definitely not food avoidant. 

We are at the point to take him to a Psychiatrist to see if this is a mental health/gut disorder. But i am literally at my wits end. He cant work, clean, interact, anything when he is sick but sleep and throw up! Ive been in therapy for the last 8 months dealing with depression/anxiety/sleep issues due to this. Im a nurse, i should know what to do, but i cant fix him and that tears me up inside. We have a fabulous, low stress relationship, and I provide for us financially well enough to where he doesnt worry about bills. 

Please help me or give me some guidance. I need to help him so we can actually live our life and plan a wedding and have goals that we wont feel like this black cloud will cover for the rest of our lives together.",18,96,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hrdqky/3_years_of_vomiting_and_60_pounds_of_weight_loss/"")",2020-07-14 17:44:27,Physician Responded

He wasn't eating or going to the toilet properly. He told me he wasn't in any pain but admitted to my older sister that he was. Long story short after a CT scan he was admitted to the ward and after 6 hours of phone calls we were finally told that he has cancer.
The cancer is in his liver, lungs and lymph nodes. My mum died of cancer 12 years ago so I obviously know this isn't good but no one is telling me anything. I know he has incredibly high calcium levels and I guess my question is, is there any curing this? My logical mind tells me that once it's in the lymphatic system it's a done deal but I guess I just need a medical professional to tell me straight.

Backstory - I’ve been smoking weed for almost a year now. Plenty of times I’ve had panic attacks or at least gotten really paranoid and my heart rate has increased pretty drastically compared to what it normally would be. This doesn’t happen very often but I’d definitely say I’ve gotten kind of used to it. 

Last night and about a week or two ago I had it pretty bad. I checked my bpm last night and it got up to at least 130 at times. When this happens I’m literally just sitting in my room trying to watch YouTube but obviously I’m really high and thinking something and might happen to me so it’s hard to focus and calm down. I try looking up what a bad heart rate would be but for some reason I can’t find any answers on google.

I’ve been allergic to mosquitoes for as long as I can remember, and usually they just turn into small-ish welts and go away after about a week with some major itching. However, I moved to Indiana a little while ago and I was out at dusk (because I am an idiot) and got eaten alive by the mosquitoes. 

I wouldn’t necessarily mind this, but these welts are MUCH bigger than normal. There is one on the bottom of my foot about the size of a quarter, and another on my thigh that’s about the diameter of a baseball, and that’s just a couple of them. I have a few more unusually large welts as well but the rest of the bites seem as normal as they can be for me. They switch from not itching at all, to being unbearably bad, to being really hot and slightly painful.

hrj3iz,Do I have Lymphoma or some form of brain cancer? Doctors are so far stumped. Need urgent help as my health is deteriorating fast.,"Hi all,  


I (24M, 71KG, no drug use) have been having some major health issues since January with no resolution. Posting here to see if anyone has experienced similar?

Current symptoms:

\- Persistent RUQ pain below ribs (5 months)

\- The same pain has now developed on lower left rib

\- Persistent lower back ache (Tailbone and buttocks)

\- Chest pain and neck pain (neck feels extremely tight both sides)

\- Constipated

\- Ligheaded and dizzy

\- Constant headache  


I'm most worried about the localised headache and dizziness I have every single day. Doctors are saying this is tension headaches from all the stress but I'm unsure with their diagnosis. They performed a basic neurological test in-person and I passed.

Current tests I have had done: Abdominal ultrasound, chest/abdominal x-ray, colonoscopy, cbc blood test. All tests came back clear.

Do you think this could possibly be lymphoma that has started out in the abdomen and spread to the brain? Is this very likely?

I’m staying at my fathers apartment for a couple days and I just woke up with small red bumps that look like bites scattered primarily on my legs, but also on my chest and stomach as well. There’s also 2 areas on my stomach that look like a large slightly red patch of skin. I immediately thought it might be bed bugs, but now I’m thinking it could be dust mites because I am also having a cough and some trouble breathing. These respiratory issues started yesterday afternoon and I noticed what looked like a bug bite on my breast yesterday. I am also kind of itchy all over, not super itchy but definitely uncomfortable. 

Does anyone know what this is? I am going home tomorrow and am really scared to transmit this back to my home and my boyfriend. I won’t be able to see a doctor before I return home tomorrow so I need to know what I’m dealing with here and how to prevent spreading it. Could whatever this is infect my skin, hair, clothes, suitcase and backpack, and if so, how do I make sure I don’t bring this back home with me? Also how can I treat this?

Edit: I do have eczema but I have never once had it on my legs, stomach or chest (really just my hands, occasionally my arms) before and my eczema does not look or feel like this. My eczema is EXTREMELY itchy to the point where I almost can’t resist itching it and looks completely different to this rash. This rash is really only mildly itchy and I can resist itching it just fine. I’ve also never once had a reaction to any detergents used for laundry or clothing.

hrld8e,Friend died of lung cancer... I want to know how it might've happened.,"I hope this isn't a dumb question.. but one of my online friends passed away recently. We never met IRL, so he never told me about his lung cancer. Exactly two weeks before his death, he seemed fine when we talked, was excited about the Cyberpunk release and was planning future shows to watch and things to do. Even joked around like his usual self, like it was just another day. Talkative and attentive. It wasn't the attitude of someone I imagine would have terminal cancer.  

The next day, he informed us of his lung cancer, and that he was going to go away for a few weeks, and would only return if he were still alive... (in his words). We later found out that he had surgery a few days later, and a week later he passed away.  

It just all happened too fast for me. How he seemed fine and suddenly he was gone. I'm not asking what might've caused his cancer because he was a chronic smoker and lived in a polluted area so who really knows but what I'm curious about is how long he might've been fighting this disease for before it took him down, and how it caused him to pass away so rapidly. I assume the surgery was an attempt to remove the tumor? What does it usually mean when the patient passes away after surgery? Does the cancer progress too far or does the surgery itself have its risks? I'm not very medically knowledgeable and english isnt my first language so I hope this is legible. I just want closure for what happened to my friend. He was 26 Male and from Asia.. 6'3"" 250lbs.

Like what? That does not seem right or correct at all, or am I wrong? I thought I can have a look at the numbers myself or at least a doctor's consultation to talk about them, but they said to ""not worry"" and ended the call?

hrrp7w,Could this be real?! Or is it a dangerous scam?,"I got a Facebook ad today(normally just scroll on by these) and it claims it can make your breasts perkier and fuller. It sounds scammy, but there’s a lot of comments saying it works. I tried to research myself but got in over my head and didn’t really find anything relating to this specific method. This is its claim:

“Bring It Up Breast Lifter patches contain a collagen-boosting, ultra-lifting formula that tightens over-stretched breast lipid tissue and ligaments due to sagging. Over time, it improves the breast’s overall bounciness and skin elasticity. It's enriched with anti-aging active ingredients and nourishing hyrdrators that deliver an ample smoothness against wrinkles. The end result is a boosted, upright, and youthful breast shape. Bring It Up Breast Lifter patches provide visible results in 15-30 minutes of use and permanent improvement with continual usage. These patches are hypoallergenic, making them skin-friendly for skin types. It's the perfect product for women whose breasts are sagging due to aging, weight gain, and breastfeeding.”

I don’t want to fall for a scam, but I’m very insecure about my breasts. I don’t have any children, but I have one breast/nipple that “droops” a lot more than the other, but don’t want to get surgery.

hrtlrf,Can someone just give me a general idea about my MRI? I had it over a week ago—I think the doc is either slammed or on vacation,"34f 

Weight 115
Height 5’3

No drinking used to be occasional smoker

I take meds for adhd 30mg 

I take vitamins 

Symptoms are typical neurological(numb,brain fog) and pain. All over pain(joint and muscle) and jaw, neck, back. etc
MRI readings below 


I was diagnosed  with osteomyelitis of the jaw in November. I spent a week in the hospital, but they were unsure if it was from a tooth they pulled or something else. I had been to the dentist 3x and was told the tooth was fine? 🤷🏻‍♀️ I had just had a cavity filled on it previously they pain after would come and go. Went to the hospital and was admitted immediately wit large diffuse jaw swelling etc. Doctors are unsure if it was osteomyelitis or something else but sclerosis keeps showing on the MRIs. 

This last mri says the sclerosis is stable? It then goes into all of this other stuff, that is unrelated. I googled it all of course and was not thrilled. So—I’m basically looking for clarity about the sclerosis still being there and the extra findings? Should I contact a neurologist? Thanks for any guidance. 😊

htj6dk,How concerned should I be by an ECG 'showing certain abnormalities'? (29m in the UK),"Last weekend I was diagnosed with ADHD.  The psychiatrist asked that I have some tests before prescribing me medication.

I had an ECG taken at my local GP by a nurse who then sent them on. Yesterday when I got home from work I had an email from the psychiatrists admin asking that I speak to a cardiologist before prescribing me anything alongside a letter from my psychiatrist (addressed generically to any cardiologist asking them to assess me and advise on the medication) in which the most he confirms is 'his ECG is showing certain abnormalities'.

Neither the letter or the email state any urgent concern but they were very plain and did not give any information on the actual ECG. I've been thinking about it non stop since yesterday. I am a worrier so part of me thinks I am focusing on it too much, but on the other hand I've gone from thinking my heart was healthy to my heart showing some abnormalities. 

I'm assuming it cant be that bad otherwise they would have told me to seek urgent medical care? Or maybe if the ECG isn't perfect they refer you to a cardiologist before making a prescription to cover themselves and 'abnormalities' are relatively common? Would someone who understands ECGs have assessed the test or would my GP just forward them on to the psychiatrist? 

How concerned should I be? I'm going to call the GP on Monday but any advice to help get me through the weekend would be great.",1,8,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/htj6dk/how_concerned_should_i_be_by_an_ecg_showing/"")",2020-07-18 09:14:23,Physician Responded

htk7hs,Lump at the very top of gum line,"Apologies if this sub doesn’t do dental.

Details: 18M, 5’10, 160, white, non-smoker, root canal recipient 2 years ago.

Pretty much two years to the date I chipped my front tooth playing basketball. There was still the base of the tooth connected to the gum line, but the root was exposed. 

I went to dentist A to get a root canal done, and then a week or so later I went to dentist B to get a replacement tooth that is connected to the base that was left from my real tooth.

For the past two years I wouldn’t say the gum above the tooth hurt, but if I were to ever apply real pressure to that part like right below my nose, it would definitely be uncomfortable as opposed to anywhere else on my mouth. Also, it was always probably just slightly inflamed, but nothing too noticeable.

About a week ago, the tooth began to hurt, and now, all the way up my gum at the very top, there is now a large smooth lump. It’s not incredibly painful, but it’s unpleasant and definitely causes some discomfort.

I imagine it is some sort of infection with the root canal from 2 years ago. What are the most common ways to fix something like this? I can think of just simply draining the lump, or doing the root canal/crown all over again, but I am unsure.

My (32F) partner (30M) has PKD in his family. His sister was diagnosed very young (around 3 or 4, my partner was a baby) and at the time both his parents were found to be carriers.

Now his mom (60F) was just diagnosed with PKD. I looked on the Mayo Clinic website and it seems that it’s a 50% chance that he has it for ADPKD since his mom must have that version? Since she was diagnosed as an adult?

Mayo also says if both parents are carriers it’s a 25% chance of ARPKD which must be what his sister has? Since she was diagnosed very young? 

My question is this: how at risk is my partner for PKD? 30ish years ago his mom was found to be a carrier but was not diagnosed and now she’s been diagnosed. What does that mean for him? Could he get a false negative if he’s tested? Or have things advanced in 30 years? He claims he was tested as a baby so he shouldn’t need to now, especially since he has no symptoms (his mom and sister have severe symptoms-sister has lost a leg and needed transplants). Is that accurate? I think he should get tested and his mom is pushing for it but he says she’s “crazy” and that he’s fine.

The thing burst and the pus started leaking out, I cleaned it up with sterile cotton, and the thin layer of skin tore. After cleaning up all the pus I saw a hole with now clear liquid oozing out. ( the size of the pointy end of a safety pin ?) 
I started freaking out, I didn’t want it to get infected so I cleaned it with Iodine solution( Betadine ) and I put some iodine powder over it ( povidone) covered it with cotton and medical tape so the open hole doesn’t rub over my pants. 

It’s been a day and I checked the hole to see if any scab has formed over it so that I could remove the bandage. Opened the thing and more pus leaked, this time it was kind brown ( maybe caused by the iodine powder ? ) I cleaned it up again like before and taped it up. 
However I noticed that the hole was a tiny tiny bit bigger. I’m kinda freaking out, I don’t think I can go to the doctors since no one is available due to the increase in the Coronavirus cases.

htlrlj,"Bruising after injection is...different, and a question regarding what causes the feeling of muscles ripping.","[bruising](https://i.imgur.com/JWF0Ev7.jpg)

35F, Midwest US, 4’11, 119 lb, daily smoker, Adderall 15 mg 2x/daily for ADHD

Hope I attached the pic right.  I know a lot of people bruise after getting stuck, and I used to when I was anemic but that there is a new one on me.  It was a quick injection of contrast for MRI, hurt no worse than things like that ever do, and kept my arm bent up for several minutes after. The dots started small and it achieved maximum blotchiness about a day later.  Just weird, wanted to find out why it happened.

I feel like shit.  The MRIs were of brain/neck/IACs to check for tumors, MS etc. (issues with balance, nystagmus, pulsing ringing in ear,general nervous system shenanigans). No results yet (apart from some 1-2 inch lymph nodes in my neck, brain/IAC not uploaded yet) but the problem is I’m not sure any of that would account for the current hell that is feeling like my muscles are ripping when I move.

It’s not flu-type achey.  It’s “I flexed my bicep pretty good and now I’m gonna cry for ten minutes” ripping and burning.  I didn’t try that again.  All my muscles are like that, some hours/days are better than others.  Lot of times I have to take breaks when I chew or when I’m cutting up food. When that happens there’s a lot of trying to suck in as much air as possible. I don’t even feel like I’d have a low oxygen reading, I just wear myself out doing basic things to that extent.

When I sit after a period of being up doing the normal, the bone cramps set in and the muscles jump.  Whether up or down I get random localized brief pains like I’m being hit with a hammer here and there.  My muscles seem to “roll” under me when I shift and my joints are weak and easy to injure, like the springy things in them are sprung.  That’s just as close as I can get to an accurate description.  I’d had those giant twitches for a few months now (and also back during the onset of the symptoms that necessitated imaging) but the pain and weak feeling is new.  

I was anemic since I was a teenager from endometriosis and adenomyosis, but a hysterectomy 2.5 years ago fixed that.  My hemoglobin happily started to climb up after that, funny thing is, per the blood work I’ve had since then, it never leveled out or stopped.  My last test was in February I believe, and hemoglobin was 15.7.  That seemed high to me, and unless it chose that moment to finally stop climbing I’m a little worried I have iron overload.  Maybe that would explain the redness and burning in my hands and feet, and the fact that I feel like I’m dying of heatstroke 24/7.

Also those lymph nodes the MRI picked up have a pulse that matches the one in my wrist and I feel a surge there when I’m active or upset.  Totally fine probably.

If you’re still reading I’d just like some thoughts.  I honestly kind of have a bad feeling.  Monday I can get something done when I talk to the doc if need be but if anything I’ve said jumps out at a reddit doc, please let me know.  It’s going to be a long weekend.

htm1y1,Terrified - Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2D AND Neuropathy type 7,"As I write this I am absolutely terrified and having great difficulty organizing my thoughts. 

For sake of expediency, history has been truncated. Very long, complicated, winding road, lots of bad advice, bad doctors, significant time has been lost. 

Here go's.

(A few weeks shy of), 66M, Caucasian, Single, Live Alone, 2 story townhouse

Summer of 2009, declared disabled, working diagnosis, Idiopathic Neuropathy

EMG's

January 2013; Legs; Abnormal Study

January 2019; Legs; Severe, chronic poly neuropathy

March 2020; Legs; Worse, shows progression

July 2020; Arms; ""... evidence for axonal and demyelinating features ...""

April 2019 -  Nerve Biopsy, Left Foot, Left Side. Purpose: Rule out CMT. Neurosurgeon botched. Sample was to be submitted raw, he put it in some medium and submitted to pathology.

By reading the report, I discovered he botched the sample. I spoke with pathologist, she would not come out and emphatically state with absolute certainty all the information that could have been attained from a raw sample was gathered due to the medium obscuring the condition o the myelin.

 June/July 2019 - Genetic testing. Purpose Determine if CMT and/or other genetic problems.

Results. ""Three variant of uncertain clinical significance were seen.""

\- Recessive/dominant hereditary sensor  and autonomic neuropathy type 6

\- dominant CMT type 2D

\- dominant distal herditary motor neuropathy type 7

Genetic testing ordered by genetic counselor with the largest hospital system in this small state (don't know if allowed to state specifics)

Genetic counselor reviews the report with me and 2 of my family members. Told me point blank to my direct question, ""So, I do have CMT then?"" No. you do not necessarily have CMT. She left me and my 2 family members with distinct impression I do not have CMT.

Variant 3. Counselor said this is the most concerning, and this is where the majority of the review was spent. 

""... Vocal chord paresis has been reported in this condition. ..."" 

The counselor stated: ""We stressed that this VUS does not constitute a diagnosis of HMN7 ...""

Counselor advised I see a Neuromuscular specialist ASAP! She recommended her 'personal friend' Dr. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. At the same hospital. Per counselor, all Neuromuscular specialist have long wait list. I get a call there is a cancellation for this specialist, wait several weeks, and when i get there discover her conversational English is very limited. She does not think so. When I ask her about the vocal paralysis, she said, no that is not true.  As time goes on, my confidence in her abilities as a dr and ability to communicate are seriously in doubt.

Through my own research I discover CMT has a few ""Centers of Excellence""  around the country. Earliest appointment I could get was May 27, 2019 with Penn Med, CMT Center of Excellence. About 1-2 weeks prior to appointment, I get the, you've been CoVided call. Now, can't see the CMT specialist until the end of December 2020.

I asked my pain mgmt dr to call Penn Neuro and see if she could get me in earlier. I have this weird internal feeling I've never felt in almost 66 years, that all I can explain it as, as if my Life Energy Force is draining out of me. Sheo managed to get me an appointment with a different Penn Neuro specialist not affiliated with the CMT center.

The March 2020 EMG of my arms and hands occurred because I demanded my pain management dr. order it done. She had ordered the 2019/20 EMG's of the legs. Based on learning something during the 2020 EMG of the legs, I demanded the arms be done.

Based on the report of the arms, Yes, I do have CMT type 2D even though the Genetic Counselor 1 year before said no.

I have been complaining about pain in my hands and fingers. So I scheduled with Rheumatologist for lab work. Per lab results the pain in my hands can not account for the degree of arthritis the lab and x-rays show.

Thursday, July 9th, 2020, I still believe I do not have CMT. Late Friday July 10, 2020, I discover the arm EMG pretty much says I do. I look up CMT Type 2D. I had pretty much come to terms over losing my legs and feet, had just ordered a Rollinator, first one. And when I learn I am losing the use of not only my legs and feet, but also my hands and arms, I just break down. All this time. LOST! 

I can't get anyone from Penn to return my calls, I don't know what to be on the look out for regarding my hands or vocal paralysis. I don't know what, if anything, I can do to help myself. PT of what kind? (I am doing general PT 2x week)

I am almost 66. I live alone. I've always been independent and self reliant. and Now I discover my hands are going to turn into claws, my feet are pretty mangled already, and I will be wracked with pain in body and wont be able to even speak.

The hospital that was treating me with the genetic study, the neuromuscular specialist, physical physitarist, the neuro that did the 2018/19 EMGs ....they all CoVided each appointment 5-6-7 times.

I am trying to figure out what to do between now and September 4th when I see this other specialist and at the same time, I am planning my suicide because I can not live like that if it all is true! 

I don't know what to do between now and September 4th. I don't know how to help myself or what to expect or how to plan for life or death.",5,14,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/htm1y1/terrified_charcotmarietooth_2d_and_neuropathy/"")",2020-07-18 12:02:47,Physician Responded

I have another adjustment scheduled for Tuesday but she did not suggest whether I should stop the stretches that were given to me by the physio or not. After doing some research online I've discovered that the pelvic tilt that she adjusted for could be being made worse by the hamstring stretches that I'm doing!

Trying to reach out to someone or anyone who has had this or has known someone who has dealt with this.

Age 26
Weight 195lbs
Height 5 7
Race white

On tuesday I ate kimchi, that night i had a little itching no problem, ate it again the next day, horrible clusters of hives broke out everywhere and would go away when I would take benadryl.

Come thursday it was the same, so I took more benadryl. Then yesterday (7/17) I went to the er because my throat started itching and lips were swollen. Long story short I have now benadryl and steroids.
 What I want to know, is this long term? Is this from the kimchi? Is this a reaction to stress? What could it be.
I smoke cigarettes, I work out, I have had HPV flare ups before, the only thing I have had in my diet change is the kimchi. I drink coffee and red bull. Occasionally drink brewskis.
Just had a fibula surgery, roughly 6 weeks ago, non IV drug user also an EX drug user.
Also have been free from prison for less that a year, like 11 months. Have a bunch of tattoos from prison.
I also had a staph infection that I took antibiotics for and drained myself.

Not looking to be handed an answer but I'd like to pointed in a right direction.
Should I stop taking my multivitamin? Should I take in more vitamin c? Should I stop eating spicy food?

Complaint: inflammation found in colon, rectum, esophagus, and stomache. Active CMV infection. Chills, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, ulcers in throat, food intolerance, anal fissure, anal pain, bleeding with bowel movements, abdominal pain, pain in left upper abdomen, loud burping.

The album above has colonoscopy and endoscopy biopsy results, blood testing, stool testing.

This all started last year, I had an anal fissure and had been constipated for the past year. Anal bleeding with every bowel movement.
 
Colonoscopy Nov. 2019 : anal fissure and inflammation in rectum

Partner (37 male) started having symptoms of nausea,vomiting, anal pain, abdominal pain and the above symptoms in January of 2018.

We were living together and were exposed to mice at the time in our apartment.

February 2020: 
All above symptoms got intense for me in February. Saw colorectal surgeon and was referred to GI after my fissue didn't heal from diltiazem ointment and anal inflammation was still present. I started feeling full after eating, bloating, pain in abdomen, nauseated after eating, sometimes cramping while eating.

March 2020:
Gi saw inflammation in anus and fissure, ordered colonoscopy and endoscopy.

April 2020: 
Colo and endoscopy:
Biopsy reports are in album.
Chronic Inflammation found in esophagus, stomache, cecum, and rectum.

First opinion was gastritis and ulcerative proctitis.

2nd gi opinion was crohn's disease or indeterminate inflammatory bowel disease.

Both refused to let me see infectious disease specialist or test me for infections even though partner and I are having same symptoms.

Partner saw ENT because of pain in throat, ent find inflammation with no follow up.

May 2020
GP #1 orders blood work, tells me I'm crazy and that I  don't have IBD or infection.
Sends me to see his ""friend"" who is an infectious disease specialist.

I see infectious disease specialist a week later. He tells me there is no infection that would cause chronic inflammation.

He says it's a coincidence me and partner are sharing symptoms. 

June 2020:

Partner goes to GP, they find an ulcer in his throat and more inflammation.

I go to the ER because I'm desperate and want answers. I have stool studies sent.

I have results in album. 

July 2020:
Symptoms  get worse.

I start seeing another GP #2 to get more opinions. She orders more stool studies.

Fecal Leukocytes are positive.

Partner gets more testing and tells me he is positive for CMV infection.

I notify new GP and got tested yesterday.

I woke up this morning with my positive result and what looks like ACTIVE CMV.

Please help me, what could be causing this?

Is this a secondary infection that is activating our CMV?

What tests and infections should I be asking for and who should I see at this point?

I know I'm dying, I'm tired all the time and I can only eat saltine crackers and bland foods. I'm sick and in pain daily.

We both we from being healthy to this within the past year.

htpho2,My doctor has no advice for pain management,"About me

I’m a 29 year old Caucasian female. I’m 5’1 and weigh 93lbs. I do not smoke or take recreational drugs. I drink maybe once a month because it negatively impacts my nervous system. 

I’ve had a lot of weird symptoms since I was a child. I’ve been diagnosed with:
- Small Fiber Neuropathy
- Dysautonomia (POTS)
- ADHD
- Low bone density
- Migraines
- Asthma

Daily medications
- 4.5mg Naltrexone (Low dose naltrexone for pain)
- 500/50 Advair (Asthma)
- 20mg XR Adderall (ADHD)
- 0.05mg Fludrocortisone (POTS)
- Azurette (bones)
- calcium and vitamin d (bones) 
- salt tablets (POTS)


The problem

Last year I was diagnosed with Small Fiber Neuropathy via skin/nerve biopsy.

I take Low Dose Naltrexone daily. Aside from that, I don’t take anything else for it. 

Meds I have tried: 
- Amitriptyline (for migraines): That made me feel very off, maybe high. I had to stop taking it

htpq4r,Skin Tumour...Or a Weird Overgrowth of Tissue?,"Age: 24

Sex: Male

Height: 6 ft

 Weight: 79 kg or 174 lb

Complaint: Weird protruding scarring, and would like to have it removed.  It's constantly getting caught in my clothes, especially whenever I bump into random things with my elbow.

Duration: 3 weeks.  Inception period was a little flat scab, but later began to grow and split off, revealing inner tissue inside.

Existing Medical Conditions: None

Drink or Smoke: None

[https://imgur.com/a/DjT2fmb](https://imgur.com/a/DjT2fmb) Graphic Warning!

About 3 weeks ago, I somehow made a cut on my elbow.  I have absolutely no clue how I did it, as I never felt it, but suddenly the usual scab occurred.  As a healthy 24-year-old, I knew exactly what to do -- pick at it! Bad habit, yes, but after it healed, the scab grew, and so did the tissue underneath. 

Eventually, the scab split in multiple directions, revealing tissue split underneath.  Imagine a broccoli crown, where the little buds are the scab, and the stem is my flesh/tissue; this is precisely how my scar looks like now.  The outer layer is hardened, but if you separate the flesh inside, you can see the tissue split into multiple directions.

The pictures don't do justice, unfortunately.  I just recently picked at it, so it bled, hence the bandaid mark, but it normally splits up instead of being neatly contained.

htpx7k,Odd rash that appeared on legs.," \[27F\] 3 days ago I woke up with this odd rash. They are red and almost purple in certain lighting. They were itchy and almost seem harder under the slightly raised skin. I have checked my bed and sheets thoroughly so I am certain that they are not from bed bugs. This is the second time it has happened, I can't remember exactly when but I believe it was a year ago. There are only marks on my legs; 7 marks on my right leg with 2 above my knee (these are the largest ones) and 5 are on my lower right leg and 1 lone mark is on my left leg. I have not changed soap, or lotion recently, so I am at a bit of a loss of where these came from. Regular anti-itch cream did not provide any relief so after showering last night I used some of my mother’s hydrocortisone cream 2.5% (I know I should not use someone else’s prescription, but I was unable to get much sleep due to the itching) the cream helped as I do not feel any itching even hours later on the spots on my lower legs, the ones above my knee still itch but I think that has more to do with my clothing rubbing against them more than anything. 

Also, I do apologize for my prickly looking legs, but as I said the marks were very itchy so it was hard to shave the surrounding areas around the marks. If anyone can help me figure out what this rash is or if it is even a rash I would certainly be incredibly grateful.

htq1oj,Penis made a crunching sound during sex,"5 days ago while having sex, my penis slipped and hit my partners pelvis. There wasn’t any bending but there was a crunching sound. It hurt for a bit but we were able to get back to it about 15 minutes later. The next day it was a little sore but not badly and not noticeably swollen.

I’ve been able to get an erection with no problem but it has felt a little tender. When we tried to have penetrative sex last night for the first time since it definitely hurt once more pressure was applied so we stopped. I’m not sure if there’s anything to be worried about here or not. I’m seeing my doctors on Monday for something else anyway, do you think he’ll be able to do a decent assessment with a remote appointment? Is there a chance there is soft tissue damage without any kind of fracture that needs more serious attention? Thanks in advance.

Caucasian, do not drink or smoke or take any recreational drug.
I am on Buspirone 5mg, Prozac 60 mg, BC, and Clonidine .1 mg

I quickly went from 130 to about 180 in a short span of time.
Here’s a little timeline: I was between 120 and 130 in April of 2019. I ended up gaining about 15 pounds toward the end of the year and was unhappy about it therefore began exercising more and eating a lot better. 
The weight wouldn’t budge, only got heavier. I ended up putting on a little over 40 more pounds since January despite my efforts to keep it off. I don’t know what I am doing wrong. 

I do not understand why all of this weight has been piling on. I have been eating healthy and in appropriate portions, stopped drinking sugary drinks and sodas, exercise daily, and normally get enough sleep. I do not consume more calories that I burn.

It is very frustrating to be putting in work and getting no results, rather the exact opposite. I know that antidepressants and birth control can make you gain weight but I didn’t think it would be this drastic. Plus, I have been on some type of antidepressant or anti anxiety medicine for about 3 years now. 

I started the prozac about a year and a half ago, the bc about 2 years ago, the buspar about a month ago, and the clonidine maybe 2-3 weeks ago. Nothing really adds up.

If anyone has any idea what might be causing this, please let me know. It’s putting me in a bad place.

htsk2z,Concerned about Covid after I made someone laugh without a mask on!,"31 - Male - US

I had a electrician at my house today and we social distanced the entire time. They were on the outside panel of my house and originally had a mask on, and asked if it was ok to remove while they worked out there, I said absolutely since I wasn’t going out there. 

When it came time to pay they went to put their mask on and dropped it in a puddle and I said not to worry since I was wearing a cloth mask. 

We didn’t stand too close, but I forget what we were talking about, but I cracked a small joke and he gave out a decent laugh since I caught him off guard. 

Now I’m wondering if I was too close to him while he laughed without a mask. Or if my basic cotton mask would have kept me safe? It wasn’t wet, but I got a little sweaty since we stood outside for about 5-10 minutes as I was waiting to pay. 

Here’s a picture from my security camera on how close we were when he laughed. Should I be concerned about Covid?

httjxm,"I probably asked like 10 times on other subreddits and I haven't gotten any helpful responses, I'm coming to you guys as a last resort.","This is gonna be a REALLY long post to be able to explain everything so buckle up.

Anyone else do shit as a little kid and not recall anything you did for a long time until suddenly for no reason at all everything just kinda snaps backs into your head years later? That's what happened to me a few months ago when I was just watching some TV. So anyway, when I was relatively little (9-13 or 14) I used to take trips to Bulgaria to see my grandparents over the summer months and they had an apartment in a big city and a tiny house in a little village. And I would switch from going to the apartment and then to the little house, and back and forth every few weeks. There was a little shop probably not even half a mile away from my grandparent's house in the little village where you could buy food and other things (basically a convenience store.) I would often walk there by myself and back to buy a few things. I was pretty mischievous as a little kid and kind of a pyromaniac so I would often buy matches and lighters to burn things with secretly. I would eat the food I bought (a few small bags of chips and this jelly filled bread thing and a soda in a plastic bottle or cup.) And then I would go to this really close by abandoned park and burn some leaves or grass or cardboard I found with the matches and/or lighters I bought. I would also often burn the plastic bag or bags the food was carried in and the food containers and drink containers themselves as well. I've been trying really hard to remember how many times I've burned plastic containers and wraps and other shit but I really can't come up with a concrete number since somedays I would burn the plastic containers and wraps from the food I bought and other days I wouldn't. And because somedays I wouldn't even go to the shop at all. So anyway the reason I'm even writing this whole story in the first place is because now I'm 15 and I understand burning plastic releases chemicals and fumes you probably don't wanna breath in because they're probably pretty bad for your health. But back then I didn't understand what I do now so when I suddenly remembered a few months ago that I used to burn a plastic shit it came as a shock to me. I did some research online and I'm getting results about CANCER and a shit load of other TERRIBLE health effects??!! I'm getting so fucking nervous over this and I'm completely unsure whether or not I'm overthinking this entirely or if my nervousness is completely justified given what I've read online. I mean I didn't burn the plastic in a confined area instead I burned it outside and I'm pretty sure I usually stepped back a little. But still, what I'm reading online is fucking horrifying! Getting cancer or having cancer at this young of an age is unimaginably fucking scary, man. I just made this account probably 20 minutes ago to see if anyone on reddit who has some knowledge or expertise on my issue can help tell me if I'm completely and utterly fucked or if I'm completely blowing this shit out of proportion. (Also I just want to re-state this since I just re-read what I wrote and I don't think I did a good enough job of highlighting this) I have gone on a vacation to see my grandparents every year for the summer months probably since age 9-13 or 14. And I have gone through my same routine of sometimes going to the store to buy food and then sometimes burning the plastic containers and wraps on all of those vacations I took during the summer months.

httqxf,Mystery Poison Ivy???,"Okay, so.

33f, white, 5'7"", 190 lbs, I take adderall (20 mg), lexapro (10 mg), and toprol-XL (50mg). I drink socially (but haven't in months) and smoke cannabis semi-regularly. 

Last Saturday, I noticed a small rash on my left wrist and thought ""huh, looks a little like a poison ivy rash. That's weird, I haven't been anywhere near places that poison ivy grows."" 

The past several weeks I haven't been anywhere much but at home, in my backyard, which is not overgrown and has no big bushes or other brush that could hide poison ivy (what's more I've mostly been hanging out in my hammock, nowhere near any plants at all), or at work, at a preschool, which has astroturf on the playground even, no real grass at all. I couldn't think of any way I could have possibly come in contact with poison ivy, oak, or anything like that. I'm a former girl scout, though, and I've gotten rashes from poison ivy several times in the past. I'm pretty familiar with what it looks and feels like.

Sure enough, by the next day I was pretty sure that was what I had. Very itchy, small, clustered blisters, a gross, clear discharge. What's more, now there were rashes developing on my stomach, the back of my thigh, and weirdest of all, *directly* on one of my nipples. It is... uncomfortable.

I'm totally flummoxed. I have no idea how this happened! But I went to the pharmacy and got some poison ivy wash and some itch cream, and after some research I made sure to wash anything I knew I'd touched after I'd noticed the rash, in case there was any oil still on it. When I was a kid I was told that poison ivy could spread if you scratched it, but my research told me that's not true. Still, I've been trying hard not to scratch, since I don't want any scars and that just makes it feel worse.

Just now, though, I noticed a couple small bumps on the back of my hand. It seems like it might be spreading, or else I somehow exposed myself to poison ivy again, or I didn't manage to wash something that still has oil on it. Or maybe it isn't poison ivy at all???

I'm at a loss, I just want the itching and grossness to go away. Do I need to just... wash everything I own? Never go outside again? Rip my arms off to stop the itching?!

httrp8,Small Lump (slightly larger than a pea and solid 1-2cm) in my middle-left back,"I'm a 22 y/o Male, 166lbs who has had no previous health problems before and I am not on any medication. 

I noticed it around march but every time I asked someone to feel for it, they couldn't locate it. Almost as if the lump wasn't there and it was all in my own head. 4 months later (to now) and I again notice the same lump, what feels the same size (slightly bigger than a pea). However, this time I asked my mother to look for it, and this time she said she could feel it. When I stand up/ sit up straight I can't feel it but when I bend forward I can. It's around 1-2cm and it hurts a small bit when I push on it.

These past 4 months I have been laid off due to COVID, I've been mainly sleeping a lot, laying in bed or sitting down gaming for at least 20 hours of my day at a minimum, however, in the past month I've started playing soccer a lot too.

I'm trying hard to avoid the irrational Google search and inevitably freak myself out more. However, should I be worried and make an urgent doctor's appointment?

I guess it was just a matter of time for this to happen.
I remember that when this started I told my parents ""If I ever get hard to an 11 year old girl or younger I will kill myself"".
Today this happened, im not feeling anxiety, im not feeling anything. I was almost sure that I was a pedo, and now I have 0 doubts.
Maybe POCD just made me realize who my true self was. Heck, maybe it wasn't even POCD all the time, i was probably just using it as a form of denial.
I'll try to get some sleep and I dont know what I will do when I wake up, but I imagine it wont be good.
I dont want to kill myself, but at the same time I do.
I dont want to make my family suffer because of me, but I also dont have any desire to live knowing that I am a pedophile.
Maybe I will commit suicide, maybe I won't. I just dont think I can make a decision right now. Im numb, I feel like im already dead.
I was supposed to go to a psychiatrist next week for an evaluation session, but now I dont know if I want to.

And to top it off, I’ve had stabbing pain from from where the implant is, occasionally. I’m not sure what to do, I rang 111 and they told me to go to the doctors but I know full well that there is a huge waiting list.

He said it is most likely an allergic reaction to the antibiotics, however could also be a staph infection (although very unlikely). He said we will continue to monitor it.

hu297y,"There's a video of me just standing in the middle of classroom for 10+mins but I can't remember doing it, can it be a symptom of something?","I hope it's the right subreddit for this kind of question. I am sorry I am very new to reddit.

It happened a few years ago when I was 20 y.o. My friend was the one who recorded it for our uni event documentary video. I can't remember what I was doing but it was certainly me, my clothes, my height, and she stood up from the chair I usually was at. She (I) just stood up, walked a few steps and just stood there not doing anything for like 10 minute-ish (my friend even fast-forwarded the clip to make it even funnier on the final video, where I was just standing and everyone else was doing things in the same classroom), then walking back to the spot I was from. Everyone (and even me) was sure that it was me but I don't remember anything. It was like I suddenly went auto-pilot. I wasn't on any med, didn't drink nor smoke at all.

I sometimes also have drop attacks but it's not very often, though every time I have it I injured my knees severely, if it's related somehow?  I don't know what else information I should give, as I experienced this kinda like 'black-out' only once.

I feel this question is kinda ridiculous cs everyone thinks this is a funny story (because of how it portrayed in docu video) and it's not disturbing or anything but I've been so confused and scared as losing consciousness/awareness can be dangerous if it happens again. Do you know what this could be and if I need to go see doctor? Thank you.

**Update:** *Thank you so much for all the responses!! I didn't expect this much responses tbh so I need some time to go through them all in detail.

hu2l4f,"[24M] I have advanced fatty liver with fibrosis already, and no one can figure out why.","I am in decent shape. I’m no gym rat but I’ve always lived an active lifestyle because of my occupational background (art installation and welding). I’ve never had serious issues with my weight and I eat pretty well. My A1C checks out so I’m not even prediabetic. I live a clean lifestyle.. I don’t smoke or drink, and I haven’t been able to drink at all for a while (more on that later). I went through your stereotypical college student party phase for a bit, but I never drank myself to oblivion, never touched hard drugs, and that was years ago now. Since then my alcohol consumption has always been very moderate, and gradually declined to nothing at all as I started having worse and worse reactions. 

Anomalies in my AST and ALT were first noticed a while ago in routine blood panels to monitor the meds I take for bipolar disorder. Both have been elevated almost non-stop for a couple of years now, and no amount of medication tweaking has changed this, so thats been ruled out. Eventually I started experiencing symptoms such as joint pain, fatigue, sensitivity to heat, and my blood pressure started getting sketchy. Again nothing I have experienced has ever been able to be attributed to medication side effects. The “usual suspects” have all been ruled out. Aside from the liver enzymes, my bloodwork is always unextraordinary. Thyroid stuff is always normal, ANA is always negative, ESR and C-reactive protein are normal, CBC is normal, metabolic panel.. normal. 

Since there was apparently nothing wrong, things quickly fell by the wayside. Even though I wasn’t always feeling very good, being a busy twenty something with school, hobbies, work and social life always kept me pushing through it. In the last 8 months however, I started feeling a lot worse. Nowadays the fatigue is so extreme, I struggle to function. I constantly experience aches and pains, and the Texas heat makes everything worse. I’m beyond sensitive to heat. It makes me feel so bad and it doesn’t take much. I have a window AC unit keeping my bedroom at 60 degrees in order to be comfortable. To add insult to injury I constantly get these unexplainable fevers on and off. They just come and go like headaches. If I don’t sleep shirtless in my ice cold room, I wake up drenched in sweat. Even at room temperatures my friends consider sane, I just can’t handle it. That’s how sensitive I am. Another very strange thing that had started happening at least a couple of years ago (and this is what made me gradually stop consuming alcohol entirely) is that I experience pain when I drink. The pain is deep in my upper chest, below my collar bones on both sides and feels like it’s deep inside my rib cage behind the area where the deltoid meets the pecs. It has escalated to the point that if I even so much as have half a drink of anything made by anyone, I will experience pain within minutes lasting at least an hour. The last straw was a time when I did a single shot of rum for a toast celebrating with friends, and a few minutes later I was hiding in the bathroom writhing in absolutely excruciating pain. I was referred to a Gastroenterologist, which is what led to the discovery of the condition my liver is currently in. I’ve just finished up a whole round of new tests to no avail. I’ve been screened multiple times now for any type of viral hepatitis, everything for celiac disease is negative, and I was even tested for some more rare stuff like alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency and Wilson’s disease. The only stuff that came up is that I apparently have an iron deficiency, though I am not anemic. And as for Wilson’s, not only is my ceruloplasmin not too low, it’s almost too high. It’s literally just barely in the normal range by a decimal. Even though it’s technically normal, I don’t know whether there’s a +/- tolerance related to these tests, or whether it could be trending towards being too high later on, so I thought I would mention it. 

This is a very rinsed out version of things. I have so much more information I can provide but I’m keeping it short to start with. I just don’t know what to do anymore. It’s obvious that my doctors are stumped, and I feel horrible. Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas?

hu37a5,Sex and HPV... I just can't understand something (23F),"Hello everyone. 

I'm 23F, I never had warts, still don't have any. I just randomly wanted to get tested 8 months ago and found out that I have HPV 51,16,6.

Before knowing this, I was already in a relationship for 11 months and sometimes having unprotected sex. So my boyfriend probably has it, too.

I asked my doctor but couldn't get a solid answer.

I'm worried that I'll get throat cancer because we're doing oral. So, should I stop doing oral forever because there is a chance?

My doctor said that I'm too young and probably my body will clear it. But I'm worried about something. My partner is not young at all. So, I'm afraid, even my body can clear it, I'll keep having HPV again from my boyfriend.

And I don't think I can have sex with another person if we break up, because no one will want to have sex with me after knowing that I have HPV.

HPV and sex... How do you do that?

hu4ut5,Possible LEUKEMIA?! Random bruising despite normal platelet count.,"I am 19M, Indian and about 1 month ago, I noticed a bruise-like (painless) mark on my left arm except it wasn't round or anything but rectangular (not perfectly, of course), it was brownish when I first noticed it, later turned gray (and is still gray, hasn't faded after nearly a month), I noticed another bruise like mark on my right arm but this one was smaller and round. 

My mother has ITP so I was instantly alarmed at these, in fears they may be purpura. I got a CBC done the next day however my platelet count was perfectly normal (around 250k) and other numbers were fine too except for Lymphocytes count which was a bit higher than normal, it was 3.8 (normal range being 1.0-3.0). In fears that it might be leukemia, I asked my mother to ask her doctor about this (she had an appointment with her the next day), the doc said the raised count is because I probably had an infection recently (which I indeed did, it was a terrible fever and quite possibly COVID (lost taste and smell for 10 days) but I didn't have the chance to get tested, not like it would have changed anything anyways since I self-isolated myself already).  

Oh, she also said ""stop fucking searching symptoms on Google"" (a remark I often hear from doctors I visit)

So I went on my life, thinking these were random and not actually cause for concern but a few days back I noticed petechiae or so I believe, they were tiny pink spots but I didn't see any cluster like those images on the internet show, I had like 4-5 of these but all isolated (they disappeared quite quickly too). I still ignored it but then yesterday another bruise showed up on my leg.

This one is actually a bit weird in that it's not one bruise but 2, both parallel to each other separated by a thick line of skin. It's still kinda brownish (but different shade than what I noticed yesterday). 

I am gonna get another CBC done, to see if there is any change on there. 

I just fear it might be leukemia so I needed a second opinion here since my doc said last time it's nothing.

I had a very hard time sleeping which is unusual, unless I was high. Today I’m feeling a tiny bit better, I can feel that my throat is swollen (I don’t have tonsils either), milder hot &amp; cold swings, but I’ve been putting a cold wash cloth on my forehead. I haven’t been many places in the last 2 weeks and always social distance/wash my hands. I just didn’t have a mask. But I’m always in an out &amp; very cautious as to not get to close to anyone. To me this seems like a very normal short flu for me but I don’t know what I should do. I don’t really think it’s covid. Also, no loss of smell/taste.

No vomiting, no diarrhea, no fever, no weight loss and the only thing that seemed to start this was a fruit snack got stuck in her throat a couple weeks ago and it scared her. She went to her pediatrician after complaining for several days about her throat, stomach, and chest hurting, and he found nothing. He referred her to a GI who ordered an X-ray fluoro esophagram. Test results all normal, no reflux noted, organs and bones normal. He scheduled her for an EGD this Thursday if her COVID test comes back negative. He recently prescribed her 10 mg Famotodine, but we haven’t received it yet but should tomorrow. The question is, should we wait and see if the prescription helps first before such an invasive procedure on her? I’m certainly NAD, and just looking for advice. Watching her closely this past week while we were on vacation, she rarely complained about it as long as her mind was occupied and she was having fun. She would only mention it if she was bored or not otherwise occupied. It seems to me, knowing her, and seeing how she reacts to things that it may have something to do with anxiety. It could very well be reflux and it scares her when it happens but it seems like she fears it more than it actually seems to bother her. I just worry that the COVID test and EGD will scare her even more and may make future trips to the doctor more difficult.",1,12,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hu69a4/my_7f_daughter_47in_56lbs_is_scheduled_for_egd/"")",2020-07-19 12:17:53,Physician Responded

hu6td1,Expanding stomach (update and diagnosis),"If you've been following along... I have a massive growth on my ovary.

I got the ultrasound just a little over a week ago and they told me to see a specialist. We drove three days to get to Seattle (where I have insurance) and I saw a doctor last Wednesday. She did another ultrasound and finally told me how big the mass was. The original ultrasound put it at 22 cm. The new one showed that it had grown in the week since the first ultrasound.

That doctor sent me for a CT scan same day, and also got on the phone with a gyno/oncologist surgeon to get me into surgery asap.

She also did tumor marker blood test. Everything came back normal except one which was only slightly elevated, and that one can also be found when it's a benign tumor. So at this point we can't 100% rule out cancer till they do the biopsy. 

Two days ago I had a consultation with the surgeon and I am scheduled to go into surgery tomorrow morning.

At this point the mass is 30 cm. It is one ovary that is filling my entire abdomen, and the other ovary is swollen a bit too. So he has encouraged a full histerectomy at this point, so that's what we're doing.

He showed me the CT scan.... Damn. It's huge. No wonder I can't eat, and my breath is short constantly. 

He also said my liver, and everything else, looks healthy. The mass is mostly solid with some liquid areas, and because of the speed of the growth he said he is actually more encouraged that it is a benign tumor. He had a specific name, but it was all Latin to me. 

It's incredible that everything is going so fast, but that's good because my health has been failing pretty quickly too. I'm so tired. I've been eating more soft foods so I can get more calories in, but there's only so much I can do. I'm also dehydrated most of the time so I'm constantly sipping water, and the dizzy spells are getting worse.

Here's a rudamentary recreation of my vision from my eyes that I photoshopped. https://imgur.com/a/KCR86YY",3,6,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hubu1z/help_identifying_eye_disorder_that_i_have_had/"")",2020-07-19 17:53:40,Physician Responded
huc2ud,Weird question but I’m shedding skin in my genital area? More info in post.,"There’s no picture included but putting a NSFW tag just in case! 

19F, smoke, drink sometimes, no illnesses, no meds

English isn’t my first language but I’ll try to explain the best I can.

In the past couple days my boyfriend and I have had a lot of intercourse and now we’re both experiencing soreness in our genital areas. I’m literally shedding skin and not just around my vagina but on my clitoris too, the top layer of ‘skin’ is just coming off, and my boyfriend is shedding skin on the tip of his penis and experiences discomfort too. 

Now I know that having a lot of sex can cause soreness and rawness but this is the worst it’s ever been I mean my clitoris is literally shedding skin and it hurts a lot.

I’m 99% sure it’s not a yeast infection since there’s no smell or itching or anything and I’m 100% sure it’s not an STD.

I just need to know, what should I do know? Should I go see a doctor? Should I just let it rest or should I take extra care? And when would it be okay to go at it again? Thanks in advance.",2,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/huc2ud/weird_question_but_im_shedding_skin_in_my_genital/"")",2020-07-19 18:09:58,Physician Responded
huc581,"Need help understanding results. google is not my friend right now, &amp; my anxiety is getting the very best of me.:(","Hello everyone! Sorry for the long post. About a week ago I went to the ER for really bad pain on my right lower quadrant. They did blood work, transvag ultrasound, and a CT scan of my abdomen. After 8 horrible hours the DR told me i had enteritis and to follow up with pcp. The diagnosis made no sense as i had no other symptoms, and i left in tears, pain and empty pockets after having my iv ripped out and paying my terribly high Er copay:( 

I have a history of pcos, kidney stones, 2 abnormal paps, I’ve had elevated liver enzymes about 4 years ago. &amp; I also have chronic Gastritis, stomach ulcers, &amp; migraines. 

Okay so, today i was able to look at the results of the tests that were done at the ER. For my blood work the results that were in red(abnormal I suppose) were : 

LYMPHOCYTE #: 4.4 k/mm3 (H)
NUCLEATED RED BLOOD CELL : 0/100_wbc
RED CELL DISTRIBUTION WIDTH: 15.2% (H)
WHITE BLOOD CELL: 11 k/mm3 (H)
ALBUMIN/GLOBULIN RATIO: 0.9 ratio (L)
GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE : 81 
 
For the abdominal CT scan report, the things that stood out where : 
“Liver measures at least 20cm craniocaudal. Possible Hepatic steatosis” &amp;
“ mild scattered fluid prominence of small bowel with several air fluid levels. Loops of small bowel in the left upper quadrant measure up to 3cm, borderline/mildly dilated”

I may add that i didn’t have insurance for almost 3 years. I haven’t seen a Dr up until my ER visit.

huc74d,Swollen Optic Nerves - Is this a tumour?,"I am a 6'6 Indian male living in Canada, 22 years old, 310lbs (100lbs gained in the last 5 years). I am currently not on any medications, but I have been on three seperate 6-month long courses of Accutane between 2014 and 2017.

A couple years ago, in 2018, my optometrist noticed some slight swelling on the optic nerves. She did a visual field test, which had normal results, but still referred me to a specialist at the hospital. When I met the specialist, he dilated my eyes and did a quick exam using a bright light in my eye and decided that it wasn't serious enough to warrant any further tests or intervention so he sent me home.

Last week, during a routine eye exam, my optometrist did some retinal imaging and discovered my optic nerves were both noticeably more swollen. I did not have any headaches or noticeable visual loss or any other symptoms. She did a visual field test and noticed that my blind spot from the last visual field test was slightly larger and more defined, but I never noticed any difference. She referred me to a specialist again, and I am now awaiting their call to book an appointment.

Ever since the visit to my optometrist last week, I've made the horrible mistake of googling ""optic nerve swelling"" and letting myself get eaten up by all the horrible potential outcomes. I've even started to feel pressure behind my eyes and occasional headaches, even though this is something I did not notice AT ALL until the doctor mentioned it to me and I did my self-guided research (its probably just psychological or due to me quitting cannabis/nicotine use last week after 4/2 years of heavy use, but it doesn't help my anxiety). Now, I am awaiting a call from the specialist so that they can book me in for an appointment. I am incredibly scared that I have a tumour or MS or something horribly wrong with me. I've been having regular anxiety attacks when thinking about it and I can't help but feel like the headaches and pressure are real (even though I never noticed it AT ALL before this week). I was told the specialist will likely conduct scans of my brain to rule out any slow growing tumours or masses (since the swelling has grown worse over the past two years), and a spinal tap. This is all so frightening. Is there a chance this will go away on its own? Am I being too freaked out? Is this as serious as my research suggests?
I just want to go back to how I felt last week before I knew about all this. I feel so helpless.",2,25,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/huc74d/swollen_optic_nerves_is_this_a_tumour/"")",2020-07-19 18:18:00,Physician Responded
hucc3k,Bug Bite. Half a foot diameter. Affecting muscles. Help.,"19F.   
Happened in the Pacific Northwest near a wooded area at night.  Still a little bit of light out. Had swelled up to almost the size it is now by  the next morning.  I sat down in a chair after checking it, wearing leggings, and felt several (3-5 if i remember correctly) stings on the back of my thigh.  I swiped my leg and forgot about it.  As I said by the next morning it had almost taken up the entire back of my thigh, was **hard, red, hot**, and raised about **1/4--&gt;1/2 inch.**  I had to go home from work today because it was making it hard to walk.  The **muscles around it are sore** and I can't squat all the way down lest I experience a whole lotta pain.    


For the record I used to have allergic reactions to mosquito bites as a kid but that went away around age 12.  I've gotten a few bites this summer in the same location and they were tiny and went away quickly.  This is something else.   


It seems to be getting bigger and has taken up the entirety of the back of my thigh (width wise, but not all the way up and down if that makes sense) and I'm not skinny.

hucsc1,How long can someone last on dialysis?,"75; M; Caucasian, 6'2"", 190 lbs, Non Smoker, Non drinker, array of heart and kidney medications. Amyloidosis, Atrial Fibrillation, ESRD, artificial metal aortic valve. 

In 1998 at 54 my dad had heart valve replacement. In 2008 he was diagnosed with Amyloidosis effecting his kidneys. In 2018 with kidney function at approx 20% while taking Pomalyst an experimental chemotherapy medication to 'flush' bad protein from kidneys he got 'medication induced pneumonia'  and ended up in ICU with ARDS. While in ICU his kidneys basically stopped functioning and dialysis started about 6 months sooner than the expected timeline. He has being doing well for the most part since then, however this past spring he started retaining fluids in his long cavity and had one outpatient 'draining of the lungs' one week long inpatient hospital stay with multiple trainings and dialysis daily, now back to OP dialysis, he has had another OP draining this past week. During discharge from the inpatient stay they mentioned moving dialysis to 4 times a week rather than 3. 

My question is how hard is the additional dialysis on the body, and how bad does COVID effect ESRD and heart failure patients? I feel like he has already been given more time than expected. In 08 docs left us with the feeling that a year or two would be max with Amyloidosis. In 18 with IP stay I didn't think he was coming out of ICU and ARDS treatment.",6,20,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hucsc1/how_long_can_someone_last_on_dialysis/"")",2020-07-19 18:57:34,Physician Responded
hucuy9,i've been getting rashes on my body every evening for the past week?,"18F, i've never had this issue before. idk what could be causing it, and i passed it off as allergies as i was initially getting huge welts on my arms after leaning on my dining table (doesn't really happen anymore after i disinfected it). but now the rashes are coming onto my legs. the issue is quickly resolved after i apply some steroid cream and maybe take some benadryl, but it's a temporary fix. the rashes are huge patches of raised skin (they look like hives actually). i'm worried that it might be a bigger issue than allergies.
some more context maybe? last week i went to downtown LA to get a tattoo in a very clean private studio, but i think the pollution in the air (and laying face down on a massage chair for 3 hours) irritated my skin. the places that touched the chair are fine now, as is the skin surrounding my tattoo. not sure if this event could cause rashes to appear elsewhere on my body. i also started my period recently, and i'm for sure experiencing hormonal changes because i had amenorrhea for 6 months and this is my second period since fixing it. finally, i've been taking wellbutrin for like 3 weeks and idk if this could be some late onset allergy? any advice/leads will help, this is seriously stressing me out.",1,10,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hucuy9/ive_been_getting_rashes_on_my_body_every_evening/"")",2020-07-19 19:02:29,Physician Responded

huec1i,For my toddler.. Urology Question.,"My 3 year old was diagnosed with a large cyst in her abdomen while she was in the womb.  We were referred to a top 10 ranked hospital, since this is very uncommon.  When she was a couple weeks old, they needle drained a tennis ball sized ovarian cyst.  This was in lieu of surgery, trying to hold off till she was older.  Unfortunately, a couple weeks after that, the cyst refilled and they had to open her up to repair it.  It had been torsed.  They were unsure if the ovary would be viable.  That's just some background info that may/may not be relevant.

She is 3 now and was slow to potty train until  she got it down this February.  She was doing great, no accidents, for the first 2-3 weeks.  Since then, she has to relieve herself every 20-30 minutes.  There is no shortage of urine in the bowl, sometimes some reddish floater particles.  She has frequent accidents, wet underwear, or pull-up.  So, a few months ago we took her in and they diagnosed a UTI.  We did the full course of antibiotics, but it never fully got better for longer than a day or two.  It's just as bad now, but two weeks ago the UTI test was negative.  The pediatrician said it's probably behavioral.  

She doesn't complain of pain, but we are concerned they either missed the infection the 2nd time or there could be some sort of complication from her newborn surgery.  Should we just ""keep at"" our pediatrician and keep bringing her in for the symptoms?

Light headedness/fuzzy head - finding it hard to concentrate, not focusing and it's like my mind is cross eyed. I honestly don't feel super comfortable driving and like my reaction time is off. 
I feel like I'm not getting a good amount of air into lungs, it's not super noticeable. But when I sit down I feel like I need to breath more deeply to get a good amount of air into my lungs. 

This is on top of my usual dizziness, which has an unknown cause.

Duration of complaint: a few days

The other day, I had what felt like a blister on the underside of my second last toe on my left foot. The next day it had spread to the two toes next to it.

The next day after that, I noticed a red rash-looking thing on my right big toe. I put hydrocortizone on the rashes last night and the one of my left foot seems to have gone down a bit.

I noticed my left thumb is also starting to get the same feeling I have with the other rashes and is starting to become red.

I have also noticed the rash beginning on other toes on my right foot.

What could it be? And how do i treat it?

So, I know this may seem odd but I'm confused and slightly desperate. I'm wondering if it could be hives, a rash, or genuinely just mosquito bites. But as someone who has had allergies their entire life, it's easy for me to worry. So I have a *ton* of mosquito bites all on my upper legs, but only in the back, and they end before my buttocks. 
I do sleep on my stomach / side.
Now what's weird about this is I've been wearing t-shirts and shorts, but when the first few appeared, I switched to sweatpants, but that didn't help anything. As to why I don't have bites on my arms, back, lower legs, or feet is confusing, especially considering my arms are fully exposed. 
Which is why I'm considering hives or a rash, but I don't see how that could mimic mosquito bites- but I'm not a doctor (thus why I'm here) and need to know if anyone has seen anything like what I'm describing and can tell me what it is? I'd include a picture, but it seems semi-inappropriate.
I don't think bed bugs, because 1. The bumps aren't red, no red dots, no circles, just bumps that turn slightly pink if itched (but I'm trying really hard not to 😖 not easy!!) 2. I haven't been anywhere to get bed bugs, been in lockdown for months, my entire family hasn't left either 3. I've searched my bed up and down just in case (because I was worried) and couldn't find any trace of these pests 4. Why wouldn't they bite my exposed arms, feet, lower legs that are easier to get to, neck even?
So basically, my main fear and concern is rash, but it's not red, nor pink, just a lot of itchy bumps on the back of my upper legs.. any thoughts?

* Height: 6'1'/185-186cm 
* No existing medical issues or medications
* No smoking, drinking or drugs AT ALL

Hello there docs! I'm a 22-year-old healthy and fit male who just went and took a blood test to check for general health markers. I had fasted 13-14 hours prior to the test and had drank no water at all. I normally don't fast for that long periods of time and drink lots of water after each meal and inbetween meals.

Right after the blood draw I felt dizzy and apparently fainted for 10-20 seconds. During this time my body got some seizure-like movements, and three lab assistants had to hold me in place. I had no consciousness during the episode and felt a strong sense of terror.

After the episode, I woke up and they made me lie down, and gave me some snacks and salt water. I  felt better within 10 minutes of me drinking the salt water and eating the snacks. I've never had a seizure before ever, nor have I fainted.

Now - did this most likely happen due to my sodium balance being off-whack? Is it something to ring alarm bells and immediately go for a checkup at my physician?

hujyx8,Acne perscription/treatment question,"So before the coronavirus lockdown (UK) in march I went to see the doctor about acne and he gave me a 2month perscription (Lymcecline) and although it didnt fully 'cure' my acne it certainly helped a lot and my skin felt better overall. Sometime during that 2 months I went to the pharmacy to pick up a different perscription and seems the doc had sent over another 2month supply of Lymcycline so I used that also.

So a few weeks after that 4 month perscirption ended my acne came back I think just as bad or possible slightly worse than it was initially. My local doctors office is asking people not to come in but can fill in an online application for different ailments, which I did (and asked the questions I'm about to ask now) but all I got was a reply saying that they had sent another 2 month supply of Lymcycline to the pharmacy to pick up.

So the question I have is: will the acne ever be cured? Or will I have to keep on taking this Lymcycline perscription every day to just suppress the effects until it clears naturally over time (which I guess could take years - im 25M)

My second question (which I suppose is mainly focused on UK GP/pharmacy practices) - the perscription I have is not a repeat, does this mean I'm going to have to go see the doctor every 2 months to get a new perscription? Or will they likely make it a repeat perscription if I need a new one again?

&amp;#x200B;

PS - I know I could probably get some of this information by phoning the GP but with the current pandemic situation I think they're really busy (which is probably why I didn't get a more in depth answer from the webform) and don't want to waste their time with a non-emergency ailment.

huldgn,18F should I be worried about a possible vaginal infection?,"18F, 5’10”, 140lbs, Caucasian

Experiencing discomfort, unusual discharge and slight pangs of pain when bladder is full

Duration is one week

No existing medical issues

Currently on oral birth control (Alesse)

Use recreational marijuana occasionally 

So a week ago I used a dildo on myself (vaginal insertion). As far as I know from reviews online, the dildo is made of body-safe silicone (Dildo is made by “NS Novelties” if you want to look them up). I have used the dildo before without any problems, but this time several things were different that might’ve caused the problem:

- I usually clean the dildo with anti bacterial soap and water before and after each use, but this time I accidentally used a scented hand soap to wash it beforehand

- I used a different lube than usual that contained propylene glycol, which I read could be an irritant

- I accidentally fell asleep after using it (I was high) I had removed the dildo before falling asleep but did not clean the lube off myself. 

I woke up 6 hours after I used the dildo and cleaned myself up, as well as taking one pill of pms nitrofurantonin. My doctor has prescribed that I should take one after having sex/ inserting objects because I am prone to catching UTIs, and taking one early can stop infection. I don’t know if it would be effective after 6 hours. 

When I woke up I felt dryness/burning/irritation in and around my vagina. However, no pain during urination or blood in the urine. Also no feelings of needing to pee all the time but the irritation/discomfort was constant throughout the day, but just mildly uncomfortable. I have had UTIs before and I have an idea of what they’re like, so if this is one, it’s pretty mild compared to ones I’ve gotten in the past. When I have a UTI the pain during urination is agonizing and I feel I need to pee all the time.

However, these feelings of mild discomfort have persisted for a week. Despite getting much better about 2 days after the incident, there are still slight feelings of burning/irritation around the opening of my vagina/inside. 

I hadn’t had any unusual discharge until 2 days ago, where I found light brown discharge in my underwear. It was a very small amount, and similar in colour to the dried blood discharge that I get before/after a period. However I am on birth control and my placebo week is still 7 days away. I usually only get brown discharge early if I miss a pill, and I have been taking them on time. However, as I said, this discharge occurred in a very small amount. When I miss a pill there is more discharge and it will be constant for a few days. 

As well, I have had some cramps similar to period cramps, but very sporadically, and pretty mild. I have also had these cramps occur when my bladder is full, just a little twinge of pain, and when I went to pee I actually did need to urinate a lot, so it wasn’t the phantom need to pee that often comes with a UTI for me. And again, no pain when actually peeing. 

I’m wondering if these symptoms are enough to warrant seeing a doctor? Because of the pandemic I’m hesitant to go out for any reason and it feels dumb to go out for this stupid mistake I made that’s causing me mild discomfort. I’m gonna see if I can get a virtual appointment with my doctor but I don’t know what she could diagnose from a phone call.

humjwt,"25M - White dry patchy tongue, extremely uncomfortable and destroying my mental health","Hi, I'm reposting this for visibility. This will be the last time I repost, I just wanted to get more opinions.
I have had white patches on my tongue for four years, with white swirls at the tip. The tip of the tongue looks scarred and raw. The shape and pattern of the patches generally change over time. I have been to see several doctors, and none have ever made a conclusive diagnosis. There have been guesses of candida or leukoplakia (although ive never smoked, and take excellent care of my mouth with only 1 cavity in 25 years) They have prescribed Nystatin and other antifungals, none of which work. Also, the white patch cannot be scraped off, rather it is an issue of the skin.

Interestingly enough, I had a heart procedure at the beginning of last year. The day after the surgery, my tongue was back to normal and healthy. For one year, I wrote off the tongue issue as a result of hypoxia that would never return. Now, about 3 weeks ago it had returned worse than ever. It makes me very depressed and embarrassed, it is uncomfortable and ruining my mental health. I just finished my prescription of Nystatin after two weeks, and it didnt help.

Does anyone have any suggestions for this issue? I am hoping someone can offer advice. My mental health is at an all time low and I cannot focus on anything but this issue.

After work Friday night I came home and felt pretty under the weather. Didn't hit me until late evening but it hit pretty fast. Felt exhausted and went to sleep.

Saturday I woke up and felt mild scratchy throat and started experiencing hot/cold flashes with mild nausea. After a couple hours of that, I actually felt pretty good. Still went to bed early and took it easy.

Sunday I felt the best I have. No real symptoms other than a headache and feeling a bit rundown.

This morning when I woke up I immediately felt congested, very subtle ear pain and mild light-headed feeling. Also a very mild runny nose. So not sure wtf is going on.

Called my doctor and he recommended rest for a couple of days and we will revisit then. Took a COVID test 2 weeks ago and was negative. No fever at all. Pretty much had a constant headache.

Today, there is a visible area where I was bit, and around it is a swollen red area. The area is about an inch in diameter. It’s weeping a clean, sticky substance. I’ve been bit before with no adverse reactions. I cannot find anything online about this.

hupb6b,Swollen submandibular gland,"Good afternoon,

35M, 5'7"", 148 lbs, Caucasian, 5-6 drinks a week, non smoker.  For a few months ( and possibly even longer) I have had a lump under my jaw line. It does not hurt or cause any discomfort. I've had an ultrasound, CT scan, and CBC done, all of which came back normal. My local ENT has diagnosed it as a swollen submandibular gland. I've tried everything suggested such as warm compresses, lots of hydration, sour candy, etc, but it still remains the same. I also took a steroid for a week to try to reduce the swelling, again no change. 

My question is; should I just let it go for now? The ENT along with 2 separate radiologists have all said nothing seems abnormal. I just can't shake the thought that there is another reason behind it being enlarged. Should I push for a biopsy of the area?

hupc1n,"Low T levels as a young, fit, and healthy guy causing me health problems.","
I’m in my early 20s and noticed some sexual dysfunction starting a couple months ago. This has never been an issue for me so I got concerned. I went to the doc and had all kinds of blood tests done and I was normal, in fact I was in my best shape ever. This was coupled with some other random health problems such as bouts of itchiness at night, fatigue, and muscle weakness. I got a testosterone test done and I came to 433/dL. I lift 4x a week and do cardio regularly. I eat high protein and nutritious meals. I take multivitamins, omega-3s, as well as ashwagandha. I get 7-9 hours of sleep regularly. I do not know what is going on. I know 433 is supposedly in the normal range but I do not feel my normal self and especially with sexual arousal, etc. I would ideally want to be in the 550+ range. I am at around 12% body fat as well so it isn’t caused by too low body fat. I am at a loss as to why my test is so low for a guy my age. This started happening about a month and a half into isolation so I don’t know whether that is a factor here but that is the only thing I can think of. I can only imagine that it is some kind of psychological response but still I am not sure.

hupc28,I broke my neck 14 years ago and found out today! Can i get treatment?," (my age at the time 13)
so 14 years ago I landed on the back of my head on a trampoline. I was rushed to the hospital unable to stand or walk. They did a CT scan. 

About 12 days later I was finally able to walk about 20m (it was extremely painfull and my right shoulder got automatically lifted 30cm higher than my left) that day I was told by the doctors that I will have a full recovery and I am free to go home.

The next few months I remember little of. Mostly I was laying in a bed in our living room unable to go to school. 

2 years later I did a MRI scan (I was still struggling alot with pain in my left arm, upper back and neck) the response from my doctor was that I had a herniation and I just had to live with it.

Fast forward to 1 year ago I was feeling extremely tired of all this pain! So I tell my new doctor about my journey. (To my luck he is both my doctor and a chiropractor) so he told me the old pictures were to old for him to cnow anything about the condition of my neck) 

I got the results today and quite frankly I'm in shock!
My neck was broken in c5 and c6 and my nerves are pinched in both places

huqs60,Bacterial or viral conjunctivitis or something else?,"27/Male/70kg/5'11/Caucasian 

Current medication/conditions: Omeprazole for reflux

I get eyelashes in my eye a lot so last night when I felt something I did the usual methods to try getting out including washing with eye drops. Before I started I noticed the left of my eye and underside of eyelid (palpebral conjunctiva?) was quite red which found unusual as never really happened before with eyelash. I tried for a while but couldn't get anything out. This morning I woke up to a lot of dry yellowy/green gunk and my whole eye is bloodshot and looks much smaller than other. I tried an eyewash bath a few times in case was a lash but no success. Feels like something is stuck under my top lid and my whole eye is sore and watery, though I assume there's probably no lash?


I've had what feels like a mild cold the past 4 days (a bit snotty, slightly sore throat, slight cough and a slight headache/pain in the same eye). Still have congestion/watery nose snot and a little bit of a headache. I'm getting quite a bit of green-yellow muscousy discharge that builds up often to the corner of my eye. Could this be caused by a virus because of my coldlike symptoms or bacterial because of the gunk? I've been using a Chloramphenicol eyedrop every 2 hours, but might this be causing harm if it's not a bacterial infection? Symptoms only in one eye.

\*general urine exam

\*general blood work (im translating from Spanish so let me know if it doesn’t make sense) which includes hepatic profile,lipid profile, the one to do with blood cells (red blood cells, white and the other one) and quimica sanguina which I can’t translate...checks glucose, urea, gives a broad idea of how things functioning etc

hurfas,26M lichen simplex + skins appearance not returning back to normal," 

Hi,

I went to a dermatologist because I was always itchy downstairs on my scrotum, and wanted to get rid of this thick leathery skin I got from scratching. He said it was **lichen simplex** and got it from scratching and so the skin becomes thicker and even more itchy. The cream worked (advantan ointment, Methylprednisolone aceponate 0.1 w/w) and itching stopped. At the time of the consultation and the ones after I asked if the skin will return back to normal and he just kept saying thats not the goal, the goal is to break the itching cycle. I said, yes but will the skins appearance go back to normal after treatment, and he just replies with, thats not the aim here. So the itching stopped many months ago, I have no idea if I should still be applying the cream, and if the skin will return back to normal. I am applying it anyways because I read it may thin the skin. Couldn't get answers from the dermatologist so hoping someone here can. Thanks much appreciated

huso4i,Anyone able to help me understand these results on my liver?,"I had an ultrasound done on my abdomen this time last year and I didn't see my chart until I was browsing through it just a few minutes ago. I originally went because of a strange feeling about where my liver/gallbladder is. Like something is there. Maybe a muscle issue or something else but it isn't painful. Doc and I wanted to see if I had gallbladder issues. She said the test came back fine. I went to the ER around the same time because my postpartum anxiety made me think I was dying and I had a blood test done and one of the doctors said I might have a little bit of fatty liver. Anyway, with that info out of the way, here are my results for my liver from the abdominal ultrasound:

TECHNIQUE:
Ultrasound of the abdomen was performed using gray-scale and color Doppler flow.

INTERPRETATION:
LIVER: Diffuse increase in echogenicity, suggestive of hepatocellular disease or hepatic
steatosis.
There is no focal hepatic lesion.

Then at the bottom the overall impression of the ultrasound was this:

IMPRESSION:
Ultrasound evidence of hepatocellular disease versus hepatic steatosis

I googled hepatocellular disease and all I can find is results on hepatocellular carcinoma. I even tried googling what HD meant and if HD means HC or if they are two separate things and HD could potentially lead to HC. Also, what does ""HD versus hepatic steatosis"" mean? Isn't hepatic steatosis fatty liver? Does the versus mean they think it is HD rather than HS?

hutufv,29F - skin cancer?,"Hi all!

I’m a little concerned about the mole I have on my right hip.. I’m a bit of a hypochondriac and I’ve already made an appointment with my GP, however they’re booked out until September. I had a dysplastic nevus removed from my lower back about 4 years ago and I’ve been extremely cautious ever since. I recently discovered that nodular melanoma exists and I’m absolutely terrified.

I’m a 29 year old Caucasian female, 5’5”, and 180 pounds. Current medications are Paxil 30mg and the combination birth control pill. I don’t smoke or do drugs. I average maybe 3-4 alcoholic drinks a month.

Duration - I’m not sure the exact time I’ve had it but it’s been at least 7-8 years, possibly even longer. No changes that I know of. It is slightly raised and about 1/3 of the size of a pencil eraser. It doesn’t hurt and it’s never bothered me. I’m more concerned now because I have a history of using tanning beds (age 15-22). Thankfully I wised up as I got older. I just hope I don’t have any repercussions for my poor choices.

huu1n1,Bleeding after anal fingering,"23 female, 1.65, 80kgs, no medication(except birth control pills)
Tonight my BF and I wanted to try anal fingering. We haven't used lube(I know, silly thing) and now I went to the bathroom and when I wiped I saw mucus mixed with little strings of blood. It is kind of an insignificant amount but I am concerned as my bowel movements weren't the greatest in the last week.

huu4x9,33F with iron deficiency anemia. Is Ferrous Sulfate 325mg tablets safe?,"Background: 33 years old. Female. I have had Crohn's since 2011 and it is the cause of my iron deficiency anaemia. I just started Stelera last month as treatment for my Crohn's after Humira (which I had been on since 2012 until June 18, 2020) stopped working well enough. To give Stelera time to get working and to help calm a flare, I'm currently on a tamper schedule with prednisone (I'm currently at the 35mg week, going into the 30mg tomorrow).

So, it's probably the prednisone talking, but I'm feeling worried and I tried looking up if Ferrous Sulfate 325mg tablets are actually safe and just got ""iron can be dangerous!"" warnings. I've been taking one tablet a day since June 5, 2020 and wasn't concerned, but I can't get the worry out of my head that I might overdose. I know there are lists of symptoms, but the early warning symptoms are the same as the typical Crohn's symptoms, so here I am asking:

Am I in danger of overdosing on iron with these tablets? I don't think I have a very iron rich diet (I think I get 30-60% of my iron from my diet), but I have no clue.

PS I'd call my physician, but he's on a much needed vacay and won't be back for a bit.

huuhq7,Is it safe to go under for a colonoscopy + endoscopy with these holter monitor and echo results?,"29F/5’1”/92lbs. TLDR &amp; holter monitor + echo results found at the end of this post.

I’ll be undergoing colonoscopy and endoscopy next month due to LLQ pain that’s been persistent for the past 4 months.  I’ll be knocked out for it, and because I’ve also been getting these new weird palpitations, I was wondering if it’ll be safe to undergo both procedures. I know this sounds ridiculous, but I’m super nervous about dying, or something going wrong bc of my heart, during the exams. I’ve never went under for anything, never had surgery. And with these new/different palpitations, I’m even more nervous about it.

I’ve had palpitations since around the age of 18/19. My then-cardio diagnosed me with MVP, for which I was put on propranolol for five years, 80mg for the last two-ish years of those five. Another cardio said they were PVCs and that they may end up shortening my life? So no definite answer, really.. anyway..

For the past month and a half, I’ve been getting these really intense, stronger palpitations, different from my “normal” ones every day now. Feels like my heart is doing some crazy insane gymnastics. The feeling sinks deep towards my back. They flutter maddeningly, sort of like a butterfly struggling really hard to fly through and out of my chest.

I had a holter done in June due to chest pain and lightheadedness/dark vision/brief fainting from standing up, but because I didn’t have any palps or other symptoms recorded while hooked up, I don’t think my cardio and her NP believed me lol. But from my described symptoms alone, they are *suspecting* POTS and gave me fludrocortisone (which I have not been taking at all as she wants me to try exercising first).

I also had an echocardiogram done on June 1st.

I went back July 1st for the follow-up, mentioned these stronger palpitations, and convinced the NP to let me do another 24 hour holter test. Lo and behold, I had a total recorded number of 15 palpitations while hooked up to it that day. For those that have had these tests where symptoms would go AWOL, you’d know this is like striking gold.

So when the NP called with results she said yes, they have observed that there were indeed ""symptoms"" and hooked it up to the EKG for more info. Good news was, she said, that my heart during the symptoms were at a normal heart rate at 80bpm and that there was no evidence of arrhythmia, murmur etc. But she doesn't  know what could be causing them, these palpitations, or “symptoms” as she kept calling them (she seemed hesitant to call them palpitations). She wants me to get involved in daily cardio exercise, drink a lot of water, eat three meals a day and see if that helps and then come back for a follow-up in 3 months..

I would rather have heard from my cardiologist, but because she  couldn’t make it in time for my appointment that day, I only saw the NP.

&amp;#x200B;

**June 1st Echocardiogram** results of just the impressions since its kinda long:

1. **Left ventricle**: normal LV size and grossly normal systolic function.
2. **Right ventricle**: normal RV size and grossly normal systolic function.
3. **Atria**: normal biatrial size.
4. **Aortic valve**: normal valvular function.
5. **Mitral valve**: normal valvular function. (Also if this is normal why tf was I told I have MBo for the last 10 years of my life??)
6. **Tricuspid** valve: trace regurgitation.
7. **Pulmonic valve**:  normal valvular function.
8. PA Systolic pressure could not be estimated secondary to insufficient tricuspid regurgitant jet.
9. **Technical difficulties and limited study.**

&amp;#x200B;

**July 1st Holter Monitor report:**

The patient was monitored for a total of 22:32 hours. The total time analyzed was 22:28 hours. Start time was 9:42am1. There was a total of 103718 beats. Less than 1% were ventricular beats, there were 0 Superventricular beats, and patient is not paced.

\-Underlying sinus rhythm with rates from 50 to 131 bpm.

\-Rare VE beats noted.

\-The patient recorded diary events \* of palpitations and flutter\* the rhythm was normal sinus rhythm.

So about ten years ago I began having abnormal heartbeats occasionally. It was a skipped beat, followed by a heavy beat and then a fast, shallow heart rate for a few seconds after. Doctor told me it was nothing to worry about so I just dealt with it. 

This slowly progressed into episodes where the fast heart rate would last longer and longer, at this point it can last up to an hour occasionally. I have recorded my heart at 220 bpm during one episode with a handheld device. I get very lightheaded and confused, sweaty and my chest feels like it is very tight. It is not an anxiety attack, I have felt fine before an episode numerous times. It seems like it is aggravated by anything. If I am tired, too hot, dont eat enough, drink too much coffee, smoke too much, stressed out, exert myself too much, laugh too long, and numerous other things. Bending over or crouching seems to trigger it as well. Usually the only way to make it stop is for me to lay down and hold a deep breath. My heart will feel like it stops for 3 or 4 seconds, followed by a very heavy beat and then return to normal function. 

I have had an ultrasound, no abnormal structures found. Thyroid is fine. Blood sugar is fine. ECG is normal. Stress test was fine (Actually excelled, but had an episode on the ride home afterwards, lol). Have had numerous halter monitors but have been unable to trigger an episode in the short time I'm allowed to keep the equipment. Anytime I've had a prolonged episode, it has quit right before I arrived at the hospital. Have been unable to get an episode recorded on anything but my handheld monitor. 

It has gotten to the point where I'm afraid to go anywhere where I won't be able to get out quickly if I have an episode, like hiking or boating which are my life. I work carpentry and it really affects my ability to perform my duties and puts me at risk when I am in situations where getting dizzy could get me killed.

huxao8,Is it safe to have contact with my friend who appears to have recovered from Covid? There are one or two complicating factors.," My friend, who appears to have recovered from covid, has asked me to come over to her house. I need to figure out whether it is safe. There are one or two complicating factors.

My friend has had chronic fatigue syndrome for many years. She goes through periods where she has low energy, brain fog, pain, appetite changes, weight loss, changes in white cell count, and other symptoms. Often, when she catches a contagious disease (She recently had impetigo, for example) that would be no big deal to most people, it takes her out of commission for weeks or months. 

The worse her CFS symptoms get, the less she works. For the last year or two, she has been working only a few days a month. A few months ago, it got so bad that she had to stop working altogether. The reduced income and inability to do housework forced her to move in with her mother and stepfather. 

Towards the end of June, the stepfather developed symptoms of covid and tested positive. On July 1st, my friend began to experience symptoms as well; shortness of breath, fever, etc. On July 3rd, She went in for her own test. On July 9th, her results came back; She was also positive. But by that time, the worst of the covid symptoms seemed to be over. She continued to improve. Her last fever was on July 10th. Today is July 20th.

According to a document titled
*Isolation and Quarantine Timeframes for COVID-19* issued by our state health department, isolation of the covid patient can end...

""(1) at least 10 days from onset of symptoms and
(2) at least 3 days (72 hours) after recovery.""

It has been 20 days since my friend's on-set of symptoms. It has been 10 days since her last covid symptoms, such as fever. But can we really be sure that she is symptom free? I am not entirely confident on this point because she still has all of her chronic fatigue symptoms. She's weak, tired, has brain fog, etc. Is there any way to be sure that these are not covid symptoms still hanging around? As far as she can tell, this is just a return to the pre-covid status quo, but how confident about this can we be? I know that Any illness can leave a person feeling worn out, but I don't feel like I know enough to make a judgment In this particular situation.

huy9p9,Are there any causes of melasma that aren't related to pregnancy or sun exposure?,"Hey guys. Typical uninsured American here to just ask a couple questions. Over the last year I've developed what I believe is melasma on my upper lip. [Before and after pictures here.](https://i.imgur.com/IybI0UL.jpg) I read it can be caused by hormonal changes typically caused by pregnancy or prolonged sun exposure, but I'm not pregnant. The only hormonal change I think I've gone through (knowingly, anyway) is that I still have a Mirena IUD that's been in place for right at 7 years now but I haven't been able to get removed. I'm guessing that if it's lost effectiveness that will affect my hormones, but I wouldn't imagine it would affect it much? I dunno. I'm also not experiencing any kind of prolonged sun exposure. I don't work outdoors or spend any significant time there, especially with the pandemic now (so no swimming, etc). 

Just curious if there's anything else that can cause this? It isn't painful, doesn't seem to be getting any worse than it is currently, and it's not happening anywhere else on my body or face.

Also, anything I can do to make it better? I hate to bleach my skin or anything but I really dislike it. Thanks in advance!

20F, white non-hispanic, 5'3, 144lbs. I have Raynaud's disease and heart PVCs with no found cause (might just be anxiety, my cardiologist thinks). I have generalized anxiety, PTSD, depression, insomnia, and I have just recently recovered from anorexia. I take 150mg trazodone for sleep and I have prozac but I am currently not taking it and stopped it a long time ago. I have always had problems with sugar, but recently my problems have been getting worse. While driving yesterday I completely lost focus, I was shaky and my anxiety was through the roof. I had to stop my car multiple times. It feels like I'm about to start convulsing, or pass out. Sometimes it is a hunger issue, but other times I am not hungry. It gets hard for me to eat foods like chicken or fried rice, and instead I most often crave bread but recently it just feels like I can't eat anything, or I'll reject anything I eat. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like I'm melting. I am scared and confused, any help is greatly appreciated. I do not drink or smoke, and I do not consume anything with caffeine. Taking a glucose test hopefully soon.

edit: Frequency is usually about 3 times a day I will feel my sugar drop. I haven't changed my eating schedule, I eat normally twice a day. Tonight I ate a grilled cheese, and when my sugar dropped had a protein bar but my stomach is having a fit with it. It hurts to eat out of my ""schedule"" recently.

huzgcr,"21 Year Old Male, 205 lbs, 5’10” - Potential lisfranc fracture","Hello everyone,

About 2 weeks ago I was playing soccer and landed on my toes and heard several cracks. My foot swelled up a decent amount with bruises occurring by my heel and at the very beginning of all my toes. After elevating my foot and icing it for these past 2 weeks the swelling is almost completely gone, no more bruising, and my foot doesn’t hurt anymore. Also, there was no bruising on the bottom of my foot (which I understand to be a clear sign of a fracture).

Went to a podiatrist today and he took x rays and said that there are some irregularities in the bones on my left foot, so he ordered an MRI. He tested all the motions of my foot and I could do them all without any pain at all. 

However, around my 5th metatarsal there is very slight pain (a little less pain than if you were to press against a bruise). 

He then told me to keep doing what I was doing (icing and elevating, as well as staying off the foot completely) until I have the MRI. 

Is this a potential lisfranc fracture? Or something else perhaps?

huzo1i,Any therapeutic ways to control my fast heart rate at rest?,"Hello, I apologize for posting again. I'm 21 years old male Asian who is 171cm tall and weighs around 77kg, thus obese.

So, after several ER visits and the consultation with a cardiologist, I've been told that my heart conditions seem perfectly fine and my continuous episodes of heart palpitations, chest tightness, and breath shortness over the past week all must have been panic attacks. They recognized that my fast hear rate (95-110 at rest) is a bit concerning, but they didn't find any serious issue from any of blood test, chest x-ray, ECG, and stress test. Thus, they concluded that I will be fine as long as I gradually lower my heart rate through healthier lifestyle.

However, my consistently fast heart rate is still disrupting my daily activities quite a lot as I tire out and run out of breath easily. This is especially interfering with my attempt to exercise more. My heart rate easily shoots above 120 and even 130 when I merely walk for a bit. Is there any natural therapeutic ways (or even medications) you recommend to control my heart rate?

Also, I really enjoy watching sports and movies (especially horror), but I know those will make my heart race. Given that all the test results came out normal, do you think it's fine for me to resume watching them again? Or should I still put them on hold as a precaution until I improve my heart rate and overall health?

hv029y,[Ethics] 35F Donor Asks to fake organ compatibility?,"Hi,

I'm watching Hospital Playlist (2020), a TV series about the daily lives of several doctors.

One of the scenarios was a husband with kidney problems and need a transplant. Since the husband's parents are old and the husband's siblings have a previous illness, the husband's family asks the wife to donate her liver

The wife agrees. However, as soon as the wife is alone with the doctor, she requests to flag her organ as incompatible?

What must the doctor do in this case? Should he lie to the family to protect the wife or uphold the truth (i.e. wife doesn't want to donate) and risk the wife being ostracised?

P.S. The TV series doesn't actually tackle this dilemma directly. It just happens that the wife was not incompatible, to begin with.

I have had these lines that grow into my nails for the past year and a half. They seemed to go away at the begging of quarantine but have started coming back again.

It is only ever been on my thumbs except for about a month I had a couple indents on my index finger on my left hand. I have gone to the doctors multiple times. One thought iron deficiency which I did have at the time but I was on 300mg iron supplements and my iron levels have been normal ever since then so it can’t be iron deficiency. Then they found I had a missing calcium enzyme or it was very small or something. They don’t think it had anything to do with it but I’m not sure. I have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and I’m lactose intolerant. The nails have not caused any health issues but I would really like the look of my nails to go back to normal. I hadn’t changed any routine in my life when they got better at the begging of quarantine besides the fact that my stress level has gone down since I was off school. But I haven’t been stressed and it’s starting back up again. I’m at a loss to what it could be and doctors seem to have no idea.

I though the radius came from the thumb side and the ulna the little finger side. So why would I have so much pain on the ulna side if that's the case? The backslab seems wrapped around the little finger side too and not the thumb side. The thumb side isn't even really covered with plaster. I'm worried the ER Dr didn't do a great job and I've now got up to a 2 week wait to see someone at the fracture clinic.

I'm 26 now, and the migraines have gotten better over the years and have started to be just simple headaches that could be prevented with Ibuprofen, again shortly before my period. Always around a week. I'm due for the next one in about 3-4 days. I am 100% not pregnant. 

Yesterday while on a walk I ""looked at the sun wrong"" (thats what I felt at the time) and had a distorted line in my eyes, didnt matter if I closed them or only had one open or whatever. I was then suddenly, and I mean within 20 minutes, extremely fatigued and tired. My head started to hurt and I felt nauseous and slightly confused, mainly I simply felt unwell. I layed down at around 7 pm and tried to just relax, browse reddit or watch youtube but even that was too much. I was super sensitive to light &amp; sound, everything bothered me. By around 8 pm I fell asleep. I usually go to sleep around 12 am. I woke up at 6 and felt very slightly better but still ko. I laid back down, fell asleep when my regular alarm woke me up at 8 am. 

I forced myself to get up and went through my regular routine with coffee and so on but felt it was impossible to completely wake up. Its 12 pm now and I'm still extremely tired and I just don't feel like myself. Everything is too much of an effort and I just want to sleep until this goes away. Putting my ""symptoms"" in webMD gave me migraine as a possible result but the migraines I used to have when I was younger felt very different. Or maybe I remember them wrong, but I know that they went away after a nights sleep. I'd compare it maybe to a rough hangover, but I haven't drank since a year ago. I am however on a diet, I eat 1500 cals daily. Its been 3 months of that now and so far its been fine.

11yrs ago I broke my tib and fib in a motorcycle accident. Someone pulled out in front me and I dropped the bike, slid into a curb and somewhere in that event in broke with bones protruding. I have a rod down my leg with 4 screws.

Since then I have developed arthritis in my ankle. The arthritis isn't what is causing most of the pain. There are two screws in my ankle that ""move"". They seem to pop in and out and during the times they are out of their normal place, it is unbearable to walk. It can last up to a few weeks to a few months and I'll know when it'll pop back into place as there is this extreme relief all of a sudden. The pain will radiate up to the 2 screws below my kneecap at the top of the rod. No doctor has taken me seriously as they can't prove the screws have changed position but the pain says otherwise.

Is it possible to have the screws removed? I want them out. I can't deal with this pain anymore. It has gradually gotten worse as it acts up the arthritis and causes me to walk funny which inflames my DDD in my lower back.

I've had this issue off and on for perhaps a year but maybe 2+ years, maybe more, the symptoms only really come on when I start eating carbohydrates (I normally eat 20g or less carbohydrates). I get urge to urinate frequently, some pelvic/bladder pain, slight ache in my penis, testicular pain that comes and goes. These symptoms will temporarily clear up when I take a supplement called D-Mannose (with cranberry extract).

This lead me to believe it's a UTI or STD like gonorrhea or chlamydia, however, I recently had what looked like candida in my stool after doing a 4 day fast and taking lots of ""candida cleanse"" type of anti-microbial supplements. Also on my longest carb ""binge"" to date (6 weeks long) I started to get very achey knees and joints (systemic candida?).

Lastly I go to sleep around 10 or 11pm, and often wake up at 3:30 or 4:30 am and almost never fall back asleep (unrelated?).

So just to reiterate I typically have no symptoms when I stick to my low/zero carb diet, they simply pop up when I start eating carbs again. However this recent time was much quicker to show back up again, as I've only had some yogurt for 2 days, totalling 90g of carbs at most, and my urination symptom is back, and my pee smells a little bit off.

Also I have had some odd red marks on my body which look kind of like a rash but they disappear within hours and pop up randomly.

hv7ijl,Yet another wrist sprain or fracture question...,"36 F, 5'6"", 115 lbs, only medication is the pill, cannabis smoker

 Hi there! I wiped out on my longboard yesterday and fell on my outstretched right hand. I broke this wrist about a decade and a half before. I believe it was a distal radius fracture but I forget. It was either that or the ulna.

Right now my wrist is swollen, mainly on the outer hand area, just above the bend and slightly off center towards the thumb. If I feel around the bones and pinch them between my fingers, I don’t feel much pain, maybe just some tenderness more towards the pinky side. I don’t have any pain when I move my fingers around or bend then but I do have limited motion when bending my wrist back/forth and then side to side more so on the pinky side. A bit of limited motion and pain when going from palm up to palm down but not too much.

I sent a message to my doctor for a referral to a hand specialist but I’m obviously antsy and wondering what the reddit world thought.

hv7vyr,High RBC from too much iron?,"\[20f, 5'2, 103 lbs\]. I have well-controlled type 2 diabetes. I was on metformin for years, recently came off of it and now take jardiance.

3 months ago, my ferritin was 4. I wasn't anemic, just iron deficient. I've struggled with iron deficiency for years, and my docs have attributed it to me being a woman (I don't have heavy periods, but my diet was poor until fairly recently). I used to have a fair bit of gastric distress, and my b12 levels would keep plunging when I was on metformin. Things have been 100% better since I came off of it a few months ago.

Anyways, I started taking iron pills twice a day. I just got some blood work back, and my RBC is slightly high (5.41, reference range 4-5.10) and my MCH is slightly low 27.2 (ref range 27.5-33). It's not unusual for my MCH to be a little low, but I'm panicking because that RBC value is unusual for me. Everything else in my CBC is fine. My new ferritin result hasn't come back yet.

Is it possible that the RBC count could be from too much iron? I recently had an ECG done, and my heart is normal. I've never had any lung issues. If it's relevant, I've started working out in the past few months (I'm skinny, but was never that active before).

I'm seeing my doc next week. I know some of the responses are probably going to be ""wait until your ferritin comes back"", but I'm freaking out right now and would like to know if it's possible this is all just because of iron, and not something more sinister.

hv7wge,Louisville NICU Nurse vacationing out of Country during COVID Pandemic without diclosing.. do I report to my Department Chair?,"(She is 24 year old female) 

right now with the pandemic going on, i understand that everyone is making sacrifices and altering their lives. however a friend of mine, i work with her, is a NICU nurse. She planned a last minute vacation to Jamaica with her boyfriend and is planning on returning back to work next week. She took personal time off but did not disclose she was leaving the country. i understand that we take safety measures with taking our temperature and safety gear however i have a very uneasy feeling about her returning back to work without being honest with our department head about where she was.

i just know that as a parent of a baby in the NICU i would not be okay with knowing a nurse caring for my baby in the NICU i would not feel comfortable knowing they were just out of the country especially with COVID symptoms/high temperature not showing up for 7-14 days after exposure. 

i have talked to 2 doctors outside of our hospital and they said not disclosing where she travels during the pandemic, as a NICU nurse is extremely dangerous and that it would be irresponsible of me to not report it to my Department. 

She is 24 and a first year RN and recently employed by our NICU Unit. I don’t want to get her in trouble, however as a nurse I also know it my responsibility to take care of my patients and their health. Especially Babies in the NICU... I signed up to take care of people, not put them in further danger..

hv89pq,Itches and skin lesions resisting several doctor and dermatologist visits — Please help!,"I am posting this on behalf of my friend (they don’t use Reddit). They are getting pretty desperate for a solution because this has gone on for almost 3 months at this point. This is gonna be long, thanks in advance to anyone reading through. Tl;dr under general characteristics.

Here is their basic information:

Age: 31

Weight: probably around 100lbs (they don’t check b/c of ED history)

Height: 5’2”

Sex: F

Race: white/caucasian

Primary complaint: itches all over body that developed in painful rashes and skin lesions all over body (including groin area; palms of hands and soles of feet seem less affected)

Duration: nearing 3 months at the time of writing this

Existing medical issues: Borderline personality disorder, asthma, allergies (mammals, in particular cats and ferrets; wine; lime tree; Acari; all with asthma symptoms; possible intolerance/allergy to caffeine). Occasional migraines. Had low B12 on blood samples (they’re not vegan, but have struggles with eating enough) at the beginning of this ordeal and has been taking B12 supplements daily since.

Current medication: Seroquel 25mg (for BPD).

Hydroxyzine 10 to 40mg daily at bedtime; Reactine 20mg; prednisone 5mg (started on 6x daily, currently on 4x and supposed to reduce to 2x in a week); ibuprofen 400mg every 6 hours; clobetasol 0.05%; Glaxal Base cream (for current issue; they don’t seem to do much except provide temporary relief).

Short showers with cool water twice daily.

Has an IUD.

Tried but only moderately or not really helpful: sodium bicarbonate baths, wearing loose clothes or staying naked, no shaving whatsoever, keeping nails short.

Drinking/smoking/recreational drug use: habitual smoker (6 or 7 cigarettes/day), rarely drinks, no recreational drug use

Other possibly relevant things: Sexually inactive for at least 2 years. Got HPV in 2013 but was declared clear 3 years later after getting the vaccine. Owns 2 pet birds (doves); their cages were moved out of their room on June 28th. Used to tan on a semi-regular basis but hasn’t for a few years. Their skin hasn’t had any particular reaction to products before. History of ED, sometimes struggles to eat twice a day, but has been able to for the last few months. Lives with two roommates, both unaffected by the issue at hand. Has no A/C in their room directly, but roommates have it so they’ve tried to keep the temp under 27°C when possible.

Tl;dr My friend’s symptoms and timeline fit the scabies diagnosis to a T, except the doctors who examined them couldn’t find burrow tracks, and we are honestly completely puzzled as to how they could have contracted the infection, since they’ve been in lockdown since March with limited contacts with their two roommates, who are both unaffected. One of the roommates has leukaemia and is undergoing chemotherapy, so they’ve been very careful about mutual contact to prevent sharing COVID-19. Last dermatologist seen said it seemed to be an insect-caused problem, but my friend searched high and low throughout their room and moved and examined furniture and clothing looking for any signs or strange insect, and they couldn’t find anything at all. Bed bug traps came up empty. I suggested them to push very strongly for a skin sample to be taken during their next visit. Should they do this, and is there anything else they should push for?

On July 15th: https://imgur.com/a/H6su5NL

Today: https://imgur.com/a/W5sAT7D

Here is a detailed timeline of the symptoms development + consults and treatment attempts:

— Around May 1st, itches around anus area and butt after changing panties. Personal hygiene wasn’t best, had probably not showered in a week when it happened, and hygiene of their birds could have been much better.

— May 14th, itches have now spread to back of thighs and bottom of stomach. The itches keep them from sleeping throughout the night, so they get an in-person consult with a nurse. The nurse doesn’t see anything on the skin. They get a phone appointment with a doctor who prescribes Glaxal Base, Cerave and Benadryl. Laundry detergent changed to fragrance-free Artik Power for sensitive skin and soap for fragrance-free Aveeno.

— May 25th, new phone appointment because the itches have spread further, they now affect pretty much their whole body save for scalp, palms of hands and soles of feet, neck and face. They get prescribed Reactine and a cortisone cream (they don’t remember which one).

— June 9th, still no relief. Pimples start appearing on skin.

— June 11th, new phone consult. They get a blood sample taken and a urine test. This is where they saw the low B12 (we don’t have the full results but can probably procure them if absolutely needed). They also see some sort of allergic reaction from the blood sample, so the doctor advises to keep using antihistamines. They get a script for Aquaphor cream.

— June 15th, in-person consult with the same doc as June 11th. Under bright light, they see some redness all over their body, but it’s too pale to be seen in the daylight. The doc inspects for burrow tracks for scabies but she doesn’t see them. They get a script for B12 supplements.

— June 28th, I helped clean the bird cages and move them to a separate room in case the allergic reaction was to the birds. Doesn’t seem to have changed anything.

— June 30th, pimples are much more numerous than before, at least 30 spread all over their body, but particularly on butt. They get a consult with a dermatologist, who thinks it’s a case of bacterial folliculitis and prescribes doxycin to treat it, as well as clobetasol 0.05%.

— July 13th, a rash has gradually appeared on their thighs. Pharmacist suspects an allergy to the antibiotic and requests stopping it.

— July 15th, rash keeps spreading and is painful. Pimples have become dry and have formed scabs. The rash is very very itchy and painful, so they go to the ER. The ER takes the issue seriously and transfers them to the dermatology clinic of the hospital.

— July 16th, they get a consult at the hospital’s dermatology clinic. Dermatologist says that since lesions have formed on places where there is no hair growing, it is probably not folliculitis, but an insect-borne problem. He says a skin biopsy is not advisable because the skin is too inflamed so they won’t be able to see or deduce anything from it.

— July 19th-20th, deep cleaning of their room, moving around the furniture and inspecting clothing; they don’t find any bugs or insects, and the bed bug traps they have installed come up empty.

So at this point we’re starting to exhaust most possible avenues, but my friend is still living in hell because they can’t sleep properly and the symptoms don’t show any sign of improvement.

Any idea we could throw at a dermatologist to test for or try a different treatment for would be helpful.

Reading the facts about herpes online might answer my own question, but I’d still like to put my concerns here for input - Am I gonna be ok? Does this pose a serious threat to my health? What actions (short and long term) should I take moving forward? I also kinda just want some reassurance

PS - my doctor advised that I make an appt to discuss treatment, but if it’s incurable and I’m not experiencing symptoms, what “treatment” could I get?

EDIT:
Guess I should’ve studied the SAT vocab a bit more in high school: Since the result wasn’t a definite negative I (mis)understood the word “equivocal” to mean a positive result when it’s really just uncertain.

hv9es3,"“Buffalo Hump” on back of neck, is it due to morbid obesity or could it be from scoliosis? Can I treat it? [PICTURES]","Information:
• 23 years old

• 5’6 
• white/USA 

Medication:
• Celexa 30 mg 
• Pepcid 80mg 
• Propranolol 40 mg (for migraines/daily headaches) 

So to begin I have always had this “Buffalo hump” on the back of my neck and it has been something I’ve lived with but have been embarrassed of my whole life. I always pushed it off as a fat deposit from my obesity (currently 40 pounds down and working on major weight loss). But more recently I have wondered if it is causing or playing a part in my daily headaches and occasional migraines. Often times I have to crack my neck to release tension and pressure in my head even if I don’t have a headache. I also always notice that from the base of my neck to the hump there is a significant amount of curvature in that spinal area. Could it be bad posture? I remember when I was a kid my middle school was doing “scoliosis checks” and called me back a second for re-evaluation by staring at my back and seeing how it aligns. I never got diagnosed with it but I still wonder or worry about this hump and the curve to it. 

I have some pictures I took to show you how the spine feels under the skin and also the “Buffalo hump” for your help in assessing if it looks worrisome or not.

hv9ju0,"""Hypertensive Emergency""","Since I'm a cancer survivor (cancer age 35, now age 36), I'd really love to avoid hospitals and further checkups. I'm about 1 year out of chemo.

Last night I had a terrible ""hypertensive"" episode where my blood pressure was 163/106, as I was going through some intense IBS flare-up and potential food poisoning. As I was feeling unwell in the body (felt like the insides of my abdomen were frothing and bubbling like a witch's cauldron) and seeing the blood pressure, I panicked and my blood pressure shot up to 188/106, where it stood for about 22-23 minutes. By the time paramedics arrived, the BP returned back to its ""previous"" value of 150s/mid90s, where it stood for many hours. I eventually refused a trip to the hospital, as the paramedic didn't see the 180s, as it took them a while to arrive, a very long while. My additional symptoms were a mild (1-2/10) never-before-had headache, and blurry vision in the right eye for about half a minute.

So I decided to read on super high blood pressure and read up that it can cause organ damage and the 3-year survival rate of that is somewhere in the 50% range? So... what do you, as a doctor, believe this could be or how serious was it?

I made an appointment with my GP, but he's busy so it'll take some time to see (days, virtual anyway). So I'm posting here. How serious was this 20+ minute hypertensive binge?

hvahzl,Should I be concerned about my baby,"Should I be concerned about my baby?

My baby 0F (3 weeks old), white, no medications or preexisting conditions, approximately 8lbs and 20.5 inches, seems to have been breathing oddly for the past week. I have mentioned it to the health visitor who brushed it off as “babies breathe weird” and didn’t address it any further. My concern is that her breathing rate is usually quite high, over 70 breaths a minute, even when sleeping/relaxed. The way she breathes also looks odd to me. Her chest puffs out with each inhale and her belly sticks out with each exhale (they move opposite from each other).

hvak8g,Could treating my grandmother's kidney disease help her rapidly progressive dementia?,"Grandmother's info: 5'2"", \~120 lb, 75 years old, smoked for 50 years. About a year ago she beat oral cancer caused by smoking. She has to use a feeding tube now because eating is painful.

I'm  not involved in the doctor's appointments. All of the information below  was relayed to me through a family member with no medical training. I'm  seeking information about how the dementia and kidney disease might be  related and how it affects her outlook.

A  few weeks ago the family found out my grandmother had dementia. I'm not  sure about the circumstances under which they learned this. Within the  past couple weeks, things have gotten much worse. Today she went missing  and was pulled over by police with no idea who she was or where she was  going. About a month ago she seemed totally fine. To me, this sounds  like some kind of rapidly progressive dementia. She has also got kidney  disease that is causing a lot of swelling. She has not been able to see a  kidney specialist recently due to scheduling issues.

I  was told that dialysis may somehow help with the dementia. Is this  true? My light reading on the subject of rapidly progressive dementia  shows many people don't live long after diagnosis. Could it be treatable  for her given its possible relationship to her kidney disease? Or is  this just her new reality? I feel so sad for her. It must have been so  scary to forget who she was and what she was doing.",2,12,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hvak8g/could_treating_my_grandmothers_kidney_disease/"")",2020-07-21 09:30:41,Physician Responded
hvalip,Can therapy help with malunion?,"I have a 9 y/o brother who broke his arm last week. Based on the diagnosis it is supracondylar fracture and the doctor said he needs surgery to place pins on the bones (based on my research– CRPP). My mother doesn’t want my brother to undergo this surgery, because she said she can’t bear to see my brother having metal sticks on his arm. She cries just thinking about it. I asked my brother and he also said he doesn’t want surgery as well, same reasons. I don’t think I can convince them both to undergo surgery. And my mom says she’s fine with malunion, but not with pins sticking out of my brother’s arm. I just don’t want my baby bro to suffer bullying in the future. I know malunion can be corrected surgically, but knowing the procedure, I doubt my mother would wanna do that. I have a cousin who also went through this exact scenario years ago and her mom said she underwent therapy instead. And my mom is clinging to that. I am also hoping therapy would help… Any insights please? Thank you so much.

hvaltg,I (24M) was diagnosed with appendicitis and tested positive for COVID-19. Why did the surgeon send me home without operating?,"Age: 24
Sex: Male
Height: 6’1”
Weight: 245lbs
Race-Ethnicity: Latino

I spent Sunday evening into Monday afternoon in the emergency room for pain in my lower back that I thought was related to my kidneys. After a CT-scan and some bloodwork, the ER doctor told me that while my kidneys were fine, I did have appendicitis, and that I would need to schedule an appendectomy to avoid perforation.

While initially hesitant, I agreed and waited for the surgeon to respond. At some point in the night, they swabbed me for COVID, and it did in fact come back positive. I was sent to a different pod in the hospital for positive patients while still awaiting the surgeon’s response. 

Late Monday afternoon, the surgeon finally came in. The entire time, the nurses had been prepping me for surgery. When the surgeon arrived, he assessed me and let me know that after he reviewed my results and scans, he did not feel that surgery was immediately necessary. He went on to press down on the area and asked if there was any pain. There was some mild discomfort, but no pain.

He didn’t overtly say that the reason he didn’t want to operate was because I was positive for COVID, but even the nurses seemed to be relieved when they heard that I wouldn’t be going in for surgery, which was a little anxiety-inducing.

I am resting at home now, bearing in mind to monitor my symptoms and watch for any pain (all I feel right now is bloated). The surgeon had told me to return if I feel any pain, and that we would reassess at that point. 

Ideally, I would have just gotten it over with and had the procedure, because I was reassured over and over again that it was minimally invasive and was one of the most routine procedures out there.

What might have caused the surgeon to decide not to immediately move forward with surgery?",5,24,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hvaltg/i_24m_was_diagnosed_with_appendicitis_and_tested/"")",2020-07-21 09:32:54,Physician Responded

I am kind of frustrated with my spouse because I feel that she is not giving the answers correctly about my daughter and early intervention and the pediatrician seem to not be concerned yet, but I am. If she does have autism I want her to get help asap. Are any of these signs concerning to you?

\- does not point. I’ve only seen her point maybe three times and that was directly after I pointed, didn’t seem to have a purpose. When she wants something she will reach for it, cry/whine, and try to climb to get it sometimes (she does touch-point with pictures in her books)

\- inconsistently doesn’t respond to her name. I would say maybe about 50% of the time and if she’s playing with a toy she doesn’t bother responding

\- Social interaction: she plays peek a boo and runs after other kids but doesn’t really know what to do after that. She sometimes pushes kids her age which I read could be normal. She doesn’t really glance at us when playing with her toys and mostly looks at her toys and carries them, sometimes putting them in her mouth, but I personally don’t see any pretend play.

Pretend: She will sometimes roll cars if she sees me doing it but typically picks them up, inspects them, and places them somewhere

&amp;#x200B;

Things that she does:

&amp;#x200B;

\- appears to be good with eye contact and will look us in the eye sometimes

\- brings books to us and sits on our lap

\- gestures in response to us by clapping and waving

\- Appears to love people, she stares at people and sometimes smiles to get her attention

hvcdz9,Dyshidrotic Eczema flare up question,"I am 25F, white, 5'5"", 200lbs,  No other known underlying health conditions other than ADHD which I take ritalin for--but didn't start the ritalin until about 6 months ago.

No alcohol use. Little to no marijuana use. No other drugs use 

[I began having dyshidrotic eczema](https://imgur.com/gallery/PQLBDob) on the outer side of my index fingers (both hands) about 6-7 years ago. It was very mild for the first 2 or 3 years. Occurrences were only about once a year for a few days, fewer than 5 blisters, and it went away on it's own. 

3 years ago it began to appear in larger clusters, still on the outer side of my index fingers. It also began appearing on my middle and ring fingers. All of the blisters are the probably less than 1mm wide (basing this off my approximation of the point of a pencil). It also for the first time was mildly itchy. Usually was for a couple of weeks where they would come and go--was prescribed ""Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream USP, 0.1%"" which I think helps?

Last year it appeared on all of my toes, a ton of them, mildly itchy, not painful unless I scratched too much. But it did not appear on my hands at all.

This year it has started to appear on the palm of my hands. Same size blisters, far itched than it ever has been. Also painful. 

My question: I noticed that they only appear in the summer time. Around mid-June is when I start seeing them. Last year they lasted until mid august where clusters would come and go. Does the heat of the summer have anything to do with the flare ups?

I have always been too-hot when other people are cold. I can walk around in the cold of winter (the 0° F kind) and have hot hands and feet. When I was a kid my feet were always sweaty and I had skin peeling all the time. Even now my feet are too hot if I put too many layers on them. So I'm wondering if my intolerance for heat has anything to do with it? 

My siblings have also told me that they get these blisters too. But they haven't noticed a seasonal pattern. And they've only ever gotten them on the side of their fingers, and they don't have the same over-heating problem that I do.",1,4,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hvcdz9/dyshidrotic_eczema_flare_up_question/"")",2020-07-21 11:04:35,Physician Responded
hvcnj2,My PCP just gave up on me and need advice,"Female. Age 29. 5'8"". Weight 116 lbs. Body fat 14-15% (caliper method). Avg BP 100/70 mmHg.  Antibodies: ANA = 1:80, speckled. SCL-70 = 1.2

I'm positive I have a rheumatological disorder but keep being dismissed. How likely do you think it is that I have one? How would you proceed in my situation?

I saw a lot of specialists in childhood for arthritis. Every doctor I saw, including Rheumatologists, said that I have an autoimmune disorder and they just didn't know what it was. The arthritis isn't as severe now and I don't seem to have joint damage. I get a sunburn-like rash in the malar area, have Raynaud's, frequent low fevers, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, ocular cysts, neurological problems (migraines, potential TIA, neurocardiogenic syncope, slurred speech, confusion). I used to have iron-deficiency anemia, profuse nosebleeds, and amenorrhea. 

Ibuprofen relieves many symptoms. My face rash is much less frequent after having taken 400mg Ibuprofen twice daily for 2 months.

My fiance's mom is a doctor. She told me that my current chest pain, which worsens when I inhale deeply and causes a dry cough, is pleurisy. I get this fairly frequently. 

I lost 6 pounds this past week despite not changing my habits. I consistently eat &gt;2400 calories/day and I'm certain of that since my mom is a dietitian and has been helping me. Now I'm underweight and I feel weak and cold. My doctor suggested that I just wasn't eating enough.

I spent March and April in bed this year with very slow labored breathing, new heart palpitations and sharp chest pains. My BP was chronically very low, sometimes 80/40 mmHg. I was so weak that I literally had to crawl on the floor to get to the bathroom. My doctor said that the low BP didn't matter and that the rest of it was caused by ""stress"". For the record, *I* didn't tell him I was stressed. He made that up himself.

In response to my concerns about making zero progress on obtaining a diagnosis in 7 months, my doctor said: My antibody levels were insignificant because they'd be seen in 5-10% of people without a rheumatic disease. My heart workup (which was completed 2 months after having heart-related symptoms) looked normal. My EEG was also ""only borderline abnormal"" (that was completed &gt;4 months after neurological episodes). (Normal MRI).

The rheumatologist totally blew me off without asking me a single question. I think the dermatologist lied to me; she told me that a lupus rash had to have a plaque. The eye doctor said I had an unknown systemic problem causing my intermittent blurry vision. The cardiologist and neurologist said they just didn't know.

My doctor told me that he sees no value in pursuing a diagnosis and suggested I seek medical counseling instead. I don't see the logic in waiting until I DO have organ damage. -And I only started  functioning somewhat because I take 400mg Ibuprofen twice a day, which I can't do forever.",3,14,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hvcnj2/my_pcp_just_gave_up_on_me_and_need_advice/"")",2020-07-21 11:18:05,Physician Responded

hvdv7k,When should I be worried about a low heart rate and low blood pressure?,"27yo male, 5’-10”, 150lbs

I’ll start by saying I’ve experienced chest pain in the past, but not lately. It may or may not have been anxiety induced, but I’m not convinced that’s always the case. Two years ago this caused me to have two separate EKG’s done, an ultrasound and something where they put nodes on me while I ran on a treadmill. Not sure exactly what these looked at, but they said everything looked healthy, nothing to note or be concerned about.

Currently, my resting heart rate is usually mid to high 40’s. In the middle of the day its usually high 50’s-low 60’s. I had a physical last week and my blood pressure was 102/60. The doctor expressed some concern that it was low and since my heart rate was mid 50’s she said it may be worth seeing a cardiologist (she doesn’t know I saw one two years ago and I didn’t tell her). 

I run pretty often, about 20 miles a week, but have only been consistent with this since March. I don’t lift weights. I’ve never gotten into a serious exercise habit until now, I’ve only dabbled. I try to optimize my sleep and my diet is pretty clean. I’m not very flexible. I occasionally binge drink on weekends. I smoked for 5 years but completely quit almost 2 years ago. My mother has been diagnosed with low BP and my father has been diagnosed with high BP, both smokers. 

I don’t really deal with common symptoms of low BP (faintness, dizziness, nausea, etc). I deal with fatigue and lack of concentration relatively often and am always extremely tired and stiff in the mornings, even though I usually get about 8hrs of sleep. I often have GI issues (which I figure is due to drinking or not eating well). When it’s cold my extremities get cold and numb very quickly. 

So, is it worth seeing a cardiologist again after they said I was fine two years ago? Is this something I should even be worried about?",4,10,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hvdv7k/when_should_i_be_worried_about_a_low_heart_rate/"")",2020-07-21 12:21:15,Physician Responded

Hi everyone I am a 24 year old Male with Celiac disease and partially tore both shoulder labrums a few years ago,  
  
I’m really hoping someone can at least point me in the right direction here. I’ll give a brief background on my situation for context. 
  
When I was 18 (24 now), I started bodybuilding and was in the gym basically every single day for around 3 years. Being young and stupid, I ignored stretching/sufficient warm ups/massage, which took a real toll on my body. When I was 20, I partially tore both of my labrums deadlifting. My ortho said it wasn’t really severe enough for surgery or PT so I basically just rested them for a few months. I slooowly got started lifting again, and even got back to my pre-injury lifts, but then I started noticing a twinge in my elbow, and then a few weeks later, wrist pain and finger pain.  
  
I was frustrated and basically ignored it thinking it would go away but it just got progressively worse and now impacts my daily life. I haven’t even been in the gym for almost a year now, and I know my muscles are starting to atrophy because of how weak I am. Even just opening a door causes pain all down my arm. I also have Celiac disease which was not diagnosed until last year, so inflammation from that probably exacerbated the problems. I tried acupuncture, which helped the pain, but seems like its not helping the deeper problems.  
  
My question is, do you think that Physical Therapy is still a good option for me, even though I have so many issues? I feel that I wouldn’t even know where to start.  I really don’t want surgery, but I’d do anything to get the constant aching and soreness to go away.

They aren't painful...although they do end up itching after being present a while. They don't grow any. There's no history of trauma to those areas when they form.

Here are pictures. Some have been there since I was a teenager, and others since a few years ago. You may also note the white things on my skin that aren't in clear focus.

hvgbyd,[18F] Painful pimples really deep in the skin,"I [18F] get pimples that are really really painful on my face (usually on my chin, but sometimes on the sides of my nose). They are too deep in my skin for any spot cream to be effective. The surface of my skin sometimes gets a little red but most of the time you can’t see them.

I often get them around the same time as my period. I never get any other acne - my skin’s always been pretty clear. But when I get a pimple it is so painful that I can barely move my face without it hurting. It often goes by itself, but it can take up to 3 weeks.

hvgjdm,Can/Should I [22F] insist on an X-Ray?,"Back in 2017 I had a big horse kick my knee. It was Boxing Day and thus A&amp;E was full to the brim with drunks, so I went home and put my leg up instead of being seen. It was agony and badly bruised for weeks. I had to walk with a cane for about two months.

It cleared up and the pain lessened, but it was still extremely painful, especially going up and down the stairs.

It still hurts to this day, just as bad.

I’ve been convinced since it happened that my knee was broken, but the doctor has refused to x-Ray it and say it’s probably just a tissue injury. I can FEEL something weird with my knee, as if something is missing or dented.

I know that they can’t do much for me, but having a diagnosis would let me apply for some disability money, which I definitely need, as it is significantly limiting my mobility. 

I cannot walk for longer than a minute or so without excruciating pain and, as I mentioned earlier, using the stairs is ultra painful.

It has also affected my hip, with it feeling as if it has dislocated at times and causing my extreme pain. When this happens I am physically unable to move my entire leg until the pain eases up. 

The biggest issue came two days ago when I was making my way upstairs, trying my best to move in a way that lessened the pain, when I put weight on my right leg (with injured knee) and felt a popping sensation. The whole knee felt a red hot gush of pain which then turned icy cold. It swelled up like a balloon too but the swelling was down my the morning.

It made me nauseous and I had to climb upstairs to bed by sitting on each step and lifting myself with my left leg. 

It’s been sore even when I am not standing now and I cannot find a comfortable position for my leg regardless of sitting, laying down or standing.

Should I demand an X-Ray? I’m getting really fed up and frustrated not knowing what is causing my pain.

I’ve attached pictures of the bruising from when I first injured my knee here;

Drugs: i smoke weed quite frequently, though I haven’t smoked in about a week. I usually smoke 4-7 times a week 

About a week and a half ago I noticed a red blotch developing underneath one of my breasts. It started very small. At first I thought it was a bug bite or acne, but it’s gotten larger and more developed. Everyday it seems to get worse, they’ve now started to appear on my neck &amp; face. I have no idea what this is. I asked my doctor if he knew anything, but he’s on vacation so I can’t see him. He recommended I take Benadryl every couple of hours for 48 &amp; see if anything changes. It’s been about 24 hours since I starting taking it and nothing has changed. 

They are not painful, but itch when it’s very hot out. They’re not really raised, but they are dry &amp; scaly.  It could be allergies, but if that’s the case I have no idea what I’d be allergic to. Could it be from heat or the sun? I have one small one on my leg but other than that they seem to only appear from my chest &amp; higher.

hvgpou,"Concerned about CBC blood test, body changes","Hi, am 22F, 5'6"". 1 year ago in May I graduated college and at that time I weighed \~120 pounds for roughly 2 years. I take adderall every work day now (5 days), while in school I took 3 times a week. Have been prescribed adderall 15 mg XR for about 4 years. I am less active out of school but drink and eat about the same amount. By January, without trying, my weight was down to 108 pounds and have maintained that till now. I have not weighed that little since I was like 13, but aside from the scale I feel healthy / my body feels happy.

I eventually went to the doctor because I got paranoid about that, among also seeing new hormonal acne in February, which I didn't get before. She ran a lot of tests and thinks its a lifestyle change/the adderall. I looked at my blood test compared to online reference metrics and am concerned about my lymphocytes and monocyte % because I see they are slightly high, despite the actual count being normal. The ""absolute pmn"" was low confirmed by test/doctor. I am attaching a link to the picture of the test because I am confused about how all these parts play together and if the % matters or just the actual count.

I dont want to make a big deal out of anything to my doctor because she clearly thinks there is no issue and I do trust her opinion, but I also feel like I know my own body and know when something is off. I am overall a somewhat healthy eater, have no medical issues, and drink a shit ton of water. Should I be concerned or is this normal???

I do not do drugs or smoke. I am currently on the medication spironolactone, which I started 2 months ago, but this has not changed my pulse nor blood pressure.  I have had this combination of high pulse and low blood pressure (with the same measurements) for at least two years, and probably longer. Two years ago, my heart had been checked out by a cardiologist who only did an ECG, and they said I had an innocent heart murmur, which isn't a cause for concern.

I'm pretty sure I still have a heart murmur. Is this what is making my pulse high? Should I get checked out again in case there are any other underlying issues?

Gender: Male
Height: 5ft
Weight: 130lbs
Don't smoke and the only medication I was taking at the time was Nexium for my acid reflux


This happened awhile ago but ever since it happened I've been worried it would happen again.

So when I was 12 I had gotten up to get ready for school. Felt fine when I got up and on my way to the bathroom. I used the bathroom, washed my hands and then started putting toothpaste on my toothbrush when I suddenly felt extremely nauseous. I look up in the mirror and I was completely pale and just looked awful. I then got really dizzy and sweaty and had to brace myself on the counter so I wouldn't fall. As I was looking in the mirror my peripheral vision started to go black and slowly got darker until I was completely unable to see. I yelled for my mom and when I did I could barely hear myself. It was like listening to my voice at the end of a tunnel and my hearing was slowly going out too. By this point I'm curled up on the floor freaking out because I don't know what's going on. My mom ran in and her voice sounded so muffled I could barely understand what she was saying. She helped me up and guided me downstairs and to the kitchen. As I walked I slowly started getting my vision and hearing back but as soon as we stopped it went away again. My mom has first responder training so she sat me down and started checking everything. I laid down on the couch and after awhile, I don't know how long, my vision and hearing came back. My mom had said that I had absolutely no color to my face and that when I couldn't see my pupils were completely blown and she couldn't see the colored part of my eyes. She took me to both my doctor and eye doctor and neither could find anything wrong with me. 

After that had happened I was still really nauseous and sick feeling. I barely wanted to eat and had to stay out of school for a week. I still felt bad after that but my mom didn't want me missing anymore school and told me to call her if I had any issues. 

A test after that I had a less severe version of this . I was playing on my ds when my mom called me so I went downstairs and halfway down the stairs I got dizzy and started losing my vision so I sat down on the stairs. My mom and sister helped me to my room and in my bed. My vision came back quicker that time but I had a raging headache and any sort of light made it even worse.

Since then every once in awhile(probably like every few months) , at seemingly random times, I've had that dizzy feeling and things will start to go dark so I'll sit down for a few minutes and it'll go away. Sometimes it'll leave me feeling nauseous for the rest of the day.

If anyone knows what this could possibly be that would be great. I've looked it up online and asked on other websites but haven't found anything. It's not like it's something thats constantly happening but I'm worried it may happen again and possibly worse. It's not something that I would want happening in public or while doing something that could become dangerous because of that.

hvhwmi,Should I be concerned about momentary low oxygen saturation?,"22 M 5' 9"" 160 lbs. 

A couple of months ago, I bought a pulse ox to measure my oxygen saturation (Contec CMS50M). I bought it because I got sick in late march/early april and had covid symptoms. I figured it would help me recognize if anything got serious. 

Honestly, it's very hard for me to describe how I feel. 

Ever since then, I've had a feeling of tightness/stiffness in my chest that comes and goes. Usually, I can feel it most when Im sitting down on a couch and bent slightly forward (this is the position Im in when Im on my computer). When I feel this way, I check my pulse ox and it usually gives me a good number. But over the past week, there are moments were my pulse ox had dipped to 90% and then goes back up in a couple of seconds. 

Sometimes, I feel other things with my chest. I do breathing exercises, and if I take in a deep breath, there's a pinching pain in the center of my chest, and a couple of days ago I felt a constant need to sigh. Today, I had a feeling that I can only describe as feeling like my lung was bleeding (it felt like something was ""oozing out""). I just got up from my bed and felt light headed. 

However, I have never really felt ""short of breath"", as most people experience it. I can walk around, run, Im not hyperventilating, etc. My chest just feels weird and sometimes my oxygen is low. 

I have good insurance so I can visit doctors at one particular facility frequently. Ever since Ive gotten sick, Ive seen multiple doctors from there, both in person and online, had x rays, an MRI and multiple covid tests. Im always told that Im fine. (If any doctor wants to look at any of these, I can privately send them). 

I've told them about my low oxygen levels, and they usually dismiss it as just an anxiety attack or say that my pulse ox probably isn't working. I'm scared to ask for help from them again because they always treat me like I'm crazy. 

But I know Im not crazy. I feel *something*. My chest just doesn't feel normal.  Also, the last time I was there, I compared their pulse ox to mine and they read the same numbers. Furthermore, it isn't always low when I have anxiety. I have anxiety attacks and I know what they feel like. This is not it. The last time it read 90%, I was actually distracted from reading it because I was doing work on my computer. I've read tons of times the things that can affect pulse ox readings, like nail polish and dark skin,  and I just don't have any of them. I feel like I know something is wrong and I just cant get any help. 

I had asthma when I was 3 or 4, but I outgrew it. I remember needing an inhaler once for about a year. Other than that, Im not in any high risk category.

hvhxcc,22F Repeated Heavy Epileptic Seazures,"My sister is 22 years old.She was diagnosed with epilepsy 10 years ago after brain injury from a car accident that also left her in wheelchair.

For about 7 years her seizures were rare and light (she would have them 2-3 times in a year and she would just lose conscience for 5-10 seconds).The last 3 years have been really bad because she has heavy epileptic seizures more often, sometimes 2-3 times in a month.
Her seizures last 2-5 minutes where she tightens the jaw pretty hard and her head&amp;hand are heavy shaking.

We've been instructed by doctors to use diazepam rectum gel and to take her to ER if she has more than one seizure in a night.She has been to the ER about 10-15 times in the past 3 years and they just give her more diazepam and leave her home.

We live in a 3rd world country with a shitty medical system so i would like to get some opinions on how can we help her control seizures.
99% of her seizures happened durring the night when she was sleeping.

Felt better for a week and then sore throat, swollen gland on left side of neck,  low grade fever 99.5 at 3pm everyday with sweating armpits even in AC. Usually run low 97.6-97.8. Still happening to this day minus the sore throat. Presented in ER with those symptoms and was having heart PVC’s. ER could not find issue with me but today my neck is swollen and sore, can’t lay on that side. I can see my jugular pulsate visibly in the mirror. Chest pain off and on, on same side of neck bothering me. Should I go back to the ER? All tests results below. They did no test on my neck. 

Also, I have a lower back molar on that side that doesn’t hurt, but the gum around it looks white and it’s swollen and the gum hurts. Eating and drinking bothers it. Neck seems to hurt when I look down, if it’s straight isn’t as bad.

hvl8rb,[F] Lump on Bikini/Groin Area,"\[23\]\[F\] Height: 5’7 Weight: 117 Asian Non-Smoker, rarely drink

Hi,

So I’ve had this odd looking lump on my bikini/groin area for about two years now. At first I assumed it was a deep in grown hair, and kept exfoliating, but nothing ever happened and it wasn’t getting any better. I have yet to see a hair follicle. After doing some research I thought it could be a cyst, but if it is how would I go about popping it? 

There’s no itching, pain, and a little bit of redness. Approximately the size of a dime, give or take. I do think that it happened from a shaving mistake years ago, but I cannot be sure.

The outside of the package, which I smelled, is paper. The inside is aluminum. It had been sitting about an hour. 

I immediately panicked, because I had not yet disinfected the package. Is this a possible way of transmitting from surface to body? Or would I need to actually penetrate my nose by touching the surface then scratching the inside of my nose or something.

hvop20,Central vision is blurry after cataract surgery and retinal detachment surgery,"Hello there. I (20F) had retinal detachment surgery November last year after getting the curtain symptom. My right eye went through PPV with silicone oil and scleral buckling, and my left went through lasers. Because of the pandemic, the oil removal was pushed to just recently, late June, and I got a cataract along with it. So after the oil removal and the cataract surgery, my eye has been healing but it's about 4 weeks in and I told my ophthalmologist that the central vision isn't clearing up but the peripherals are sharp. The retina is completely flat he tells me. He asked if my right eye was a lazy eye before or if it had a tendency to be one, I said it didn't and that my right eye was the stronger one before the detachment. He told me to go through an OCT scan to check on my macula. And he also gave me lutein supplements. 

What could be the worst and best case scenarios that have happened to my right eye? What could be the most likely scenario? Should I be worried that my central vision won't be as crisp, I'm already very thankful that my vision was restored in my right eye.

My 7 year old son initially said he was having back neck pain and started knocking his head backwards. I applied many ointments and hot and cold massages. Nothing helped. After 2 weeks, he is having involuntary lower jaw movements and movements near eye brow. My GP said it might be tic disorder and have referred to a paediatrician. Appointment is three weeks away and they said it will be behaviourial assessment. I have never seen any other issues with him, except soiling his undies sometimes. It has reduced now.

When I asked him, why he is having jaw movements, he says he is having difficulty breathing. But, I don't see he is struggling to breath. While we wait for behavioral assessment, could this be due to any other issues like muscle spasm due to his back neck pain?

hvphwc,Does my situation sound like lymphoma?,"Hey guys,
Normally I would just, you know, see a doctor. But with the global pandemic and all, I am hesitant. 

So here’s my situation: 30year old female. I had my first urinary tract infection at 28 (A real one, E.coli), and have had what appears to be interstitial cystitis since then (leukocyte esterase high, cultures negative) I’ve also had yeast infections that return as soon as I stop treatment for the past six years. I have bone pains, and weird sensations in the sides of my face sometimes. I also have feverish episodes where I get the chills, but my temperature never rises about 100F. My lymph nodes swell like crazy when I am sick, and sometimes seem to swell slightly and get itchy at random. Only one small lymph node in my face stays pea sized and never changes.

Testing info:
HIV test negative, immunoglobulins well within the normal range, complement test normal, no elevated IgE. CBC normal except MCV creeps up towards 100 sometimes. Recently had a CTurogram for the interstitial cystitis stuff. Two small kidney stones, one kidney cyst. Nothing else reported. 

Does it sound like I need to see a hematologist again? I haven’t seen one for years, not since my weirdness first started. Could undiagnosed, untreated lymphoma cause the yeast infections? Would lymphoma likely have showed up on the CT urogram? I mean, they infused me with dye and took pictures of my entire abdomen. What should I do?

hvqdv8,Would a TENS machine hypothetically speed up your period?,"Asked in nostupidquestions, as this is indeed a stupid question, but they may remove it for medical advice.

I am 24, female, 75 kg , 165 cm and have no significant health issues (other than severe period pains, but no disorder or illness that causes it) and don't smoke.

So the crazy theory is:

....

ok so Ive heard that people use small TENS units to kill the pain. But, will placing the pads so that the utreus contracts speed up your period by shedding the lining faster?

I have a bigger TENS unit meant for the full body, and have a high pain tolerance (though my period pain can go above my tolerance level, making me throw up and feel faint, sometimes despite painkillers and heating pads).

Am currently trying it on my uterus now and can def feel something like movement/ contractions with i,  in addition to some visible movement. My uneducated theory is that it will essentially squeeze the lining out faster than natural cramps would, if it is adjusted strong enough. Essentially bleeding more in shorter time.

I think the mini TENS units for pain are not as strong, and so don't have this effect  (and also the higher strength defeats their pain killing purpose).

&amp;#x200B;

I dont think it will rush everything out in an hour, obviously, but maybe shorten it by half a day?

- Diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa in 2016 after a peripheral vision test. (Patchy peripheral vision). 
- Also have stigmatism (can’t remember what my eyes are)
- I am currently not taking any meds for RP

My eye specialist mentioned one of the symptoms was floaters. 

Floaters in both my eyes has gradually increased over the time since I was diagnosed, I only really notice them when I’m bored and looking nowhere and the bigger structures whenever I move my eyes. 

Today, I noticed that there were loads of them (including hairlike structures, one that looked like anaphase in mitosis/meiosis, and a ton of small circle like surrounding the bigger structures). 

I only really noticed when I was trying to focus a microscope and couldn’t determine whether it was my floaters of the specimen on the slides. 

I’ve just started a university paper (and potentially another paper) that involves a lot of microscope work and obviously the floaters will be a big problem with my results (and I’ll likely go into the field where I need to look through microscopes after I eventually finish uni).

hvrm0m,[28F] My doctor says my GI symptoms are actually normal. Should I believe her?,"28F, 5'8"", 130lbs  
Otherwise healthy, no other related symptoms  


This has been going on for 4 months now: **my morning poop is always Bristol 6!** It's not exactly diarrhea, because I just go once, max twice in the morning. It happened after a day of food poisoning, I believe.  


Later in the day I have a **Bristol 4-5** poop, max 2, or sometimes even none at all.  


No pain or bleeding. Not terrible urgency in the morning, but some. Sometimes I fart a bunch, but it doesn't seem excessive compared to my siblings for example.  
Blood test came back fine for inflammation, thyroid etc - only **tiny** iron deficiency (I do have heavy periods and an iron poor diet).  
I feel fine and energetic. Sometimes I get weird nerve/muscle pain (for about 4 months again) in my left abs/obliques, and some left knee pain (all my life), but this seems totally unrelated to me and my doctor.  


But the pain and poops do make me anxious, and my doc thinks **that** is related. I do eat some of junk food, but on healthy food days, no difference.  


I vape and drink coffee, but the famous morning poop happens before any vaping and coffee.  


Anyway, I'd like to have **solid shits.** But my doctor says that having one (or even two) mushy stool a day is **normal.** She is a well known and regarded GI and she says my symptoms are caused by anxiety (I do have mild anxiety, especially about poops nowadays), but wouldn't that affect my poops throughout the day or something? She basically put it down as **IBS,** even though I have **no pain.**  


Should I just live with my porridge poops? Should I go to a different doctor?

[Here are some images of the area.](https://imgur.com/a/o8Zrw3T) It's been there for nearly two years now. It's visibly there on my hand and in some cases will be so dry that it cracks and bleeds. It's also quite itchy some days. Roughly a eight months I went to the local MedExpress to have it looked at and they diagnosed it as eczema along with prescribing me a tube of Triamcinolone Acetonide. After using up the entire tube with nightly applications over the coarse of four or so months it did indeed seem to help but only marginally. The skin wouldn't crack anymore and wasn't as painful/itchy but it was still visibly discolored and different feeling than the rest of the skin. Any period of non-application would return it to it's previous state. Now that the tube is empty it's back to cracking and, in some cases, peeling.  Dry skin will start to peel off leaving tender skin under it. This cycle repeats roughly every three weeks. On some days it also seems to weep a transparent liquid from small bumps.   


A possible cause for this may be that a few weeks before I first noticed it two years ago I was cleaning engine parts with a harsh cleaning chemical. The chemical attacked the latex gloves I was using and ended up getting on my hands.

hvta74,Lyme? Second Opinion? Desperate,"Hello, I'm on a throw-away account because I'm THAT embarrassed.  

32F, 5'3, 135lbs, white, and my primary complaint is whole body inflammation that has been going on for about 2 years now.  I'm absolutely miserable and my pain as well as other symptoms has gotten completely unbearable since the beginning.

Symptoms:  HIGH inflammation. My body is constantly throbbing.  Stiff joints in all of my fingers in the mornings or when I wake up.  It gets better throughout the day, but it makes getting up and hobbies difficult.  Muscle weakness, taking a shower is really difficult.  Brain fog.  Fatigue so bad that most of the time I'm sleeping upwards of 20+ hours at a time and STILL feel dead tired.  Hair loss.  Heart palpitations.  Cold hands and feet while the rest of my body is smoldering and drenched in sweat.  Pain inbetween shoulderblades that comes and goes.  Pins and needles down arms into hands a couple of times a day.  New symptoms from the past month or so - chest pain, it feels like something is crushing my entire rib cage and breathing is uncomfortable.

I'll try and keep this brief - at first I thought I had the flu because of muscle pain (felt like a cold in my body and was just achey for 2 weeks).  Went to a doctor and had blood work done.  I had a minor flag for lupus so he sent me to a Rheum who did more blood work, but he couldn't find anything and said it was probably fibro.  Pain wise I was put on gabapentin (sp?) but it wasn't doing anything for the pain.  The original doctor encouraged me to get my medical marijuana card and so I did, but none of it helped and actually made my pain worse so I haven't used any of it in the past year.  I know, weird.

I went a few months trying to deal with the pain but wasn't having any luck so I found a different doctor who after going over my symptoms was convinced I had lyme disease.  I was tested and came back with bands 23 and 41 reactive but NOT the 5 bands needed for a legit diagnosis, but the doctor is treating me for lyme anyways.  The only thing that is consistently showing up in blood work is high c4a levels.  When I was tested almost a year ago it was 18,000 and recently it was up to 64,000.  Its supposed to be on a scale of 0-2,000 apparently.

My medication list is Disulfiram 125mg once a day for lyme treatment, Tramadol 50mg 3x a day for pain, Celebrex 100MG twice a day, propranol 10mg for the high resting heart rate.

I'm not seeing any improvement and I have no idea if I'm even going down the right path.  I'm afraid of starting over or being dismissed by doctors for being a ""crazy woman"".  I'm not looking for pain pills, I'm looking for the right diagnosis and treatment plan, but I have no idea how to get it or where to begin.  I'm afraid of asking my doctor for a second opinion because what if they drop me and I'm left with no one who will even give me the time of day?",12,51,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hvta74/lyme_second_opinion_desperate/"")",2020-07-22 05:55:45,Physician Responded
hvtht3,Any idea what this rash is on the inside of my elbow? 22F,"Age/sex: 22F 

Height: 5’7

Weight: 145lbs

Ethnicity: Indian

Primary complaint:

I have a pinkish/brownish rash on the inside of my left elbow (only on one arm). Sometimes it’s more brown like a scar. Sometimes it’s more pink and inflamed. Sometimes it has little pink bumps, especially along the outer edges. Sometimes it’s whitish and flaky like dry skin. It usually doesn’t feel like anything, just like dry, tightish skin. But at times will feel itchy, and very rarely stings or burns (accompanying pink bumps and irritation). 

Duration: Several months. I don’t remember exactly when it began but perhaps 5-6 months back. Very very slowly increasing in circumference

My hands have gotten really wrinkly and rough on the dorsal side these past two years.

Physicians have said it's no big deal and sais my fingers look fine, but I've met no-one with similar skin. It feels velvety and lacks normal skin pattern on the fingers, just looks like a bunch of small dots. What if anything could this be?

The fear is crippling and the anxiety and insomnia makes me truly believe I have one, especially since the insomnia began out of the blue.

hvw9uj,Possible abdominal aortic aneurysm,"Hello. I'm a 31 year old caucasian female, 5'5"" tall, 114 lbs. Former smoker: from age 18 to 22. I have had three vaginal deliveries without issue (4/2012, 11/2015, 10/2018) and still nurse my youngest, though we're in the process of weaning. I exercise regularly and have healthy eating habits. I had my annual well visit on 7/16. My primary doctor felt my aorta when she was checking my abdomen and ordered an ultrasound. I have noticed that I am occasionally lightheaded when I stand up and I've noticed a pulse in my abdomen, both before my annual exam. I have a copper IUD that causes painful cramping and I experience pain when I ovulate, but haven't noticed any other back/abdominal pain that didn't coincide with my menstrual cycle. She did say that my being so slender could possibly be the reason she felt my aorta. I have lost 20 lbs in the past three months, but assumed that it was related to weaning and the fact that we hike often during the spring/summer months. Because of this weight loss, my doctor decided to have my thyroid checked along with my regular blood work. Due to the pandemic my ultrasound appointment is not until 7/29, and my blood work appointment is this coming Saturday. 

From what I have read (trying not to fall into the Google trap), it's almost unheard of for a woman my age to have an AAA.

Hi guys. I am currently traveling in another country (Italy) and I don't know if what I found is urgent or not.

I have a sensitive skin and a high amount of moles. Recently I got burned by the sun in the upper part of my body and I got some skin shed. I am normally very careful about the sun but this time it seems it was not enough. 

Today my gf found this thing in my back next to the right arm. It seems like a wart but it has a very weird color (dark red). The size is around 6 millimeters. It doesn't hurt or itch. 

Any idea about what it could be?

hvwmlq,Antibiotics have left my skin red and itchy down below - please help!,"Male, 28, non-smoker, 167lbs. 

Anon for obvious reasons! Experienced pain in groin and swelling in testicle 1.5 years ago - it was misdiagnosed as a UTI as initial course of antibiotics removed the swelling (temporarily) so proceeded with another 5-6 courses of various tablets over the following months.

It was then (finally) discovered I had a hernia so whilst still not totally resolved; had an operation at the end of the year which has improved some of the issues.

Anyway, I first started getting redness on scrotum and inner thighs about 1 year ago - believe Amoxicillin may have been one of the antibiotic courses prior to this happening - I went to the doctor at the time and he prescribed Hydrocortisone if I re-call correctly which had no effect. I've also tried Clotrimazole 2-3 times since (on doctor's suggestion) and currently applying fairly liberally 3 times a day but again no positive effect.

Due to COVID situation, not possible to arrange an appointment. Also, it's not life threatening but some mild itchiness and not particularly aesthetic means would like to get it resolved.

I‘m being assessed as a potential kidney donor and have just completed the first round of testing. I can see the results online but they won‘t be discussed with me until a few weeks from now (waiting for the results of the Pap); so I‘m hoping for someone to give an opinion here. 

Abnormal results in urine tests (fasting, taken in the morning on two consecutive days):

1st test:
Leukocytes: 25 (normal range &lt;25)
WBC: 6-10 (normal range 0-5)

2nd test (unlike the other sample, this was the first urine in the morning):
Appearance: SL cloudy
Hemoglobin: 25 (normal range: &lt;10)
Leukocytes: 25 (normal range: &lt;25) 

Note: I have never had a urine test before. No history of UTI, not sexually active. No symptoms of a UTI.

Could these results be a false positive (maybe I did the collection wrong)? 
If not, would a UTI permanently prevent me from donating, even if it clears up either by itself or with medication? 
What treatment would be recommended given these results? 

Blood tests, ECG and blood pressure are all completely normal. 

I‘m hoping to be able to donate and really hope they don‘t just say no because of these slightly abnormal results.

Long story short it's to the point I'm considering going to the ER tonight just to get something done, I know something is wrong and I don't know if I can wait much longer because of the pain.

Is this issue trivial enough it would be selfish to go to the ER because they are busy with real issues like COVID?

At first there was no discomfort and no redness underneath any of my nails, but now both of my thumbs, and my left index/right middle finger nail area do feel sore and a bit of pressure/sensitivity as well. I use the VA for my health care, and last month they suggested I go to an urgent care, so that a doctor could physically see what's going on. He was stumped and so far the only treatment I have done is the use of a heavy moisturizer (Vaseline) on the area a few times a day and before bed, which has not helped, and the issue has continued to worsen.

I did see my dermatologist out-of-pocket this week, and I'm awaiting approval for the VA to conduct some blood work. At this point, it's really starting to worry me, as it is growing more uncomfortable, and I'm a little afraid that they won't ever heal properly if I don't get it addressed! I'd like to gather any feedback or suggestions, even if it's information to present to my dermatologist, as she was pretty stumped as well.

hvxms2,I am low on iron. Would there be any safe way to drink animal blood to increase my iron levels? Is it a bad idea? 18f,"I know it's a weird question, but it's been really making me wonder if it would work. I've been on iron supplements for two years and my iron is still so low that I'm starting to really give up.

Firstly, is there a safe way to prepare blood to drink? Would boiling blood remove pathogens and keep the iron in it? Does the animal blood matter (is pig better than cow)?

Secondly, how much would I have to drink for it to work, and how much would cause hemochromatosis? I would probably only take about 30ml a week (if it turned out to be safe to drink), I definitely wouldn't be going overboard drinking gallons.

From my research, I know some people drink animal blood if they are anemic, however this is anecdotal and I've seen no real studies on whether it's safe. I also know many cultures drink animal blood with no problems, but again, I want to make sure before I get some disease or cause a pandemic.

For example [this article](https://www.healthline.com/health/drinking-blood#is-animal-blood-safe) says that in small quantities its good, and in large quantities it's bad. They don't say the dosage and so I am confused as to whether it really is safe.

Sorry for the long post, I just have so many questions regarding this topic.

And to be clear, I am very low on iron to the point where I am getting the extreme symptoms of anemia. Can you get hemochromatosis while being anemic from iron deficiency?

Edit: Some of you are acting like I am crazy, but there are several cultures that drink animal blood and have no problems.

Hi,

My little brother’s ( male, 10 years, about 100 pounds) eye has been itching him daily for weeks. It seems to get worse around night time. He constantly complains that he feels something in it and at times, maybe I’ll see a strand of what looks like pus but many times, I don’t see anything. His eye looks more red, I can’t tell if it’s from the constant rubbing, something else, or a combination of things. He’s always trying to wash his eye out but still feels irritated. 

He recently woke up the other day having a hard time opening his eye because he said there was a lot of “gunk” around it, keeping it closed. 

I feel like he may need medical attention but my parents think it’s not a big deal or that he’s just watching TV too much. They’ve given him some eye drops that helps slightly but for the most part , he still has this issue

hw1j7v,Developing seizures from a fall?,"I’m a really paranoid person who always assumes the worst about me, I always overthink and analyze things that happened years ago. My memory taunts me.

I have to ask: Is it possible to develop seizures from falling backward?

I have a half-brother who’s one year older who I guess has Fragile X. All this time I thought it was autism but I guess it’s Fragile X. He doesn’t look like he has it. Anyway, I remember when we were kids, I’m not sure how old(Maybe 13 and 14?), we were in a bookstore with our dad. It had a carpet floor.

Our dad was off elsewhere and taking forever and I was bored. Me and him were looking at other things. I said, “hey I’ll race you from that end to this end.” And we ran from one end to the other. Then I said “let’s do it again but run backwards.” We did it and he fell while running backwards. He got up. Just got up. I asked if he was ok and he said yes.

A couple days ago I asked my dad when my brother started to get very occasional seizures and he said in his teens, he believed.

Ugh. Did that fall have anything to do with it, or is this the result of Fragile X, or something? He didn’t have to go to the hospital, he didn’t feel bad or sick or anything. Next time I saw him, he was fine, and all these years later he’s fine. We’re 28 and 29 now. He’s self sufficient. He can’t drive but he can walk to the store and get groceries. He looks and is fine for the most part. Again, he just had medicine in case he has a seizure, I guess. Or maybe he takes it every day or every once in a while to prevent seizures? I don’t know...

But yeah he’s basically been mentally deficient since he was born, I am just wondering about his seizures. 

His current stats are:

29 years old

Male

5’8

190lbs

Location: noggin

hw2lkv,"I quit smoking 1.5 packs a day with juul, was this a good choice or is my health still in grave danger?","I am a 24 year old male, 6 feet 190lb. I smoked 1.5 packs a day for 5 years and quit last week.
I am on 75mg metoprolol xl every day for high blood pressure which is under control with the medicine and 100mg sertraline for panic disorder which is not well controlled.

So last time I went to the doctor complaining of lethargy and shortness of breath going up stairs. Blood pressure normal, heart rate slightly elevated but otherwise unremarkable. Pulse ox normal. Upon auscultation she said the bottom of my right lung was developing a wheeze presumably from heavy smoking and also attributed the breathing issues to smoking too. She highly recommended I quit because the smoking was causing my symptoms so I tried to use nicotine gum for a couple days but it wasn't enough.
Anyway I heard about the juul so I tried it and within a couple days I quit smoking completely and now only use the juul vape. I have no cravings for real cigarettes but am still nicotine dependent. This was last week and I feel as though my breathing is better but I don't know if I made the right choice for my health. Should I go back to see the doctor and ask them?

Currently on Xolair 
USA
Have been on everything minus eucrisa- topical steroids- protopic-methotrexate-now Xolair 

I had a biopsy done on a very itchy rash that developed a year ago this month. The biopsy was done when the rash was only present on the right testicle but has since spread to the entire genital area including shaft/scrotum/foreskin. 

The rash to me resembles nothing on spongeotic dermatitis that I can see. In the year it has never responded to any treatment. It is constantly red and does flare to purple, but never has regressed or gone back to its original color (white). The rash itself is not scaly, and does not puss or have any fluid build up or bleed. It simply is extremely itchy and irritated. I did patch testing as well and nothing came back

I’ve been asking my derm to do another biopsy as I feel either a) there isn’t a treatment for this that works or b) we are treating incorrectly. 

The derm I’m seeing now is not the same that performed the original biopsy. 

To me, it just doesn’t mimmick anything I’ve read on spongeotic.

hw3n9r,Is this jock itch or herpes?,"24F, 5'5, 135lbs, hispanic/white, US, California

Primary complaint: itchy red bumps near groin/vulva, on the upper &amp; inner thigh and left corner of vulva. They leak pus every now and then and it keeps spreading higher toward my pelvic region.

Duration: a little over a month now. It first started with two bumps on my left lower butt cheek, then they disappeared and about a week or so later I got an itchy pimple-looking bump between the fold where the thigh and labia majora meet. I thought it was an ingrown hair, so I let it be, but then it started spreading slowly and leaking so I've been applying rubbing alcohol in that area ever since (but it doesn't really work)

Sexual history: unprotected penetrative sex with one person in April. And unprotected oral and penetrative sex with another person in June.

Other possible causes: shaving (I might've shaved against the direction the hair grows), tight jeans/shorts (I've gained a bit of weight and my shorts have gotten tighter in that area more so when I sit down)

I don't currently have health insurance and my local planned parenthood locations only offer HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea testing.
I looked up pictures of herpes sores, but only seem to get severe cases and looks nothing like what I have. I've also heard herpes aren't supposed to be itchy. I'm hoping it's just some fungal infection, but don't want to treat it as such if it turns out to be something else.

My son [10M, usually fit and healthy) had a fever, cough, chest pain, lethargy and loss of appetite at the end of March. Called our doctor who advised to keep him out of hospital as he was still breathing well, but they “strongly suspected” covid 19. (We’re in the UK and this was their guidance for potential covid 19 infections). The fever went after 5 days, then a few days later he came out in a itchy rash on his arms, legs and face that looked like chicken pox but disappeared after a few hours. After that he broke out in cold sores and swollen lips, sore eyes, low appetite, fatigue. Then a random nasal infection! He’s been through it! 

He’s back to normal now, still a bit low energy compared to how he was before, but much better than last month. However, today he borrowed my Fitbit and I noticed his heart rate was between 94 - 111 when he was resting (sitting down). I know it’s not massively over where it should be for his age, but is it something to keep an eye on?

hw8zim,Weird red blemish on lip,"For the past few years (I want to say maybe 4-5 years) every summer I have been getting this weird red blemish on my upper lip. In the beginning I’m sure it was on the opposite side (the right side) but now it’s on the left side and it appears to be bigger. This gradually appears in the summer after sun exposure, and this time I’ve noticed it’s starting to form on my bottom lip as well. 
I’m very much someone who applies sunscreen often (SPF 50 minimum) and also apply to my lips in combination to a SPF 30 lip balm. I’m prone to getting rashes/bumps on my arms and hands from the sun, but after seeing a dermatologist about 9 years ago, she wasn’t really concerned, and didn’t give me straight answers. I left with a prescription for some very expensive cream, and no idea why this all of a sudden started happening to me, and at that time there were no marks on my lips. The bumps I get on my arms and hands start to get itchy and although I try not to scratch them, I assume I do it in my sleep because they eventually break open and turn to sores, and eventually turn into the red bumps that stay until around mid October. The red marks on my lips do not hurt or itch, but I can see them get bigger over time and my skin starts to peel around them.
I thought this had something to do with my freckled skin, as I do have freckles on my lips as well.
Does anyone have any idea of what is going on?!

hw93mu,What should I do about (what I think is) an abscess?,"17M, 5'8"", \~120lbs, no existing medical issues, no medications, no substance usage

I've had a small abscess before, a little over three years ago, on the upper part of my left arm. I know self-diagnosing is bad, but I'm fairly certain I have another abscess. Two days ago, I noticed a bump on the edge of my left armpit. Since then, it's been uncomfortable and slightly painful like before. And like before, it's right above what I think is a lymph node, feels like a rigid sac filled with pus (assuming it's pus because of how the pain feels), and is \~1cm in diameter. Last time, I visited my doctor \~2 weeks after I first noticed it, and he just pressed down really hard on it until it was cleared (mostly blood came out) and gave me an antibiotic/steroid: ""Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim DS: 800-160 mg, take 1 tablet by mouth twice a day x 10days"". I have a small raised scar where that abscess was. Also like last time, it's basically like the color of my skin (the pus isn't visible) and there's no visible hole where the pus would leave. I would really not like to have another scar; would draining it early prevent me from getting one? And is doing it at home without taking antibiotics afterward okay? I'd like to be safe and visit a doctor, but I'm fairly certain it's an abscess again, and with COVID it will probably take a long time to see one (like last time). Thanks for any responses in advance.

Additional info: The medical records diagnose my previous abscess as ""Cellulitis of left upper limb (L03.114)"". I googled Cellulitis and it seems to be a similar infection but maybe more severe. This might've been an accident (or maybe the terms are interchangeable?), considering my doctor only ever addressed it as an abscess when I visited him.

hw9s0n,Cold or Covid-19?,"Last Thursday my 5 year old daughter started showing classic symptoms of a cold: runny nose, sore throat, fatigue and just feeling crummy. By Friday, she was running a low fever (99+ degrees). She got RSV as a baby, and now every time she gets a cold, it goes to her chest: wheezing, trouble breathing, etc. so we have a supply of albuterol and nebulizer. By Saturday we were gave her a few rounds of albuterol. By Tuesday she stopped having a fever and feels much better, but still has a nasty sounding cough.

Friday I started feeling sick in my stomach which turned into diarrhea. By Saturday I had a bad sore throat, running nose and aches and pains. By Sunday and ever since I have had an ongoing cough. My nose is still a little runny and my throat a little sore. I took my 2 kids into backyard to play this evening, and after about 20 minutes I felt super nauseous and fatigued and had to go back in.

My 2 year old son started getting a runny nose yesterday and has been very grumpy (and typically he has a very cheery disposition). My poor pregnant wife started getting sick yesterday: very bad sore throat, running nose, mild fever, and starting to cough a little bit.

I would say its most likely a cold since we live in Kansas City MO and there aren't really that many cases. However our neighbor with whom we share a backyard came down with severe covid symptoms on Saturday, and found out today she is positive. Her daughter and my 5 year old daughter play regularly, and several times last week. Her daughter hasn't been sick. The mother who tested positive had a really bad cough and during the night suddenly couldn't breath she was coughing so violently. They had to call 911 and she was taken to the hospital and discharged the next morning. She said that was her only symptom and by Monday, she has no more symptoms at all. Feels perfectly fine.

So it would make sense that my daughter has covid, but what I have read is that runny nose isn't that common, and yet all 4 of my household has had it. The symptoms in my family are all very similar, and differ so much from our neighbor. A week ago last Sunday, about 4 days before my daughter got sick, she spent time with my niece who was recovering from a very mild cold (they think it was a cold, my brother said she has some nasal issues and has a runny nose off and on frequently so they didn't make much of it).

hwb52o,Retained tampon - risks??? - so embarrassed,"Backstory: For the past week I’ve had a grayish discharge. I’ve always kind of had a lot of/weird cervical mucous, so I didn’t think a lot about it. Then it started to smell funny. It’s been stupid hot, so I thought maybe I was just extra sweaty down there or something, so I showered more. The last 3 days I’ve had wicked “period cramps” but it isn’t my period. 

Today: the smell was noticeable to me as I sat at work, so I started googling and worried. I landed on a list of “smelly discharge causes” and one said “retained tampon or foreign object”. I thought “nah, but might as well check to make sure tp or something else wasn’t maybe just stuck”, and OMG THERE WAS A STRING!!!! 

I flipped out and pulled it out and *gag* there was a nasty, fat, grey, tampon!!!!!  The smell wasn’t rancid or anything, but metallic and distinct. 

Question: I washed up and laid down for a bit, but omg am I going to get TSS???? I have no idea how this happened. It’s been in there for at least 10 days!!!! I’ve been using tampons for 17 years and this has NEVER happened - even when I was a stupid kid and didn’t know what the hell I was doing, I never just forgot it.

hwc9c4,[F27] Should I ask my doctor to do a contrasted CT instead of non-contrasted?,"Female, 27, 167cm, 50kg, non smoker. 

I have had swollen lymph nodes on my neck/under my jaw and a hard lump under my chin/jaw for a while now. My GP and haematologist haven’t found anything on my previous tests but the haematologist wants to do a CT scan of my chest and neck just to be on the safe side. She quickly mentioned she was slightly worried about me being exposed to the radiation, because I had a CT scan of my abdomen (for separate issue) earlier this year, and because I’m young, but she still wanted me to do it to make sure we haven’t missed anything. 

So, the last time I had a CT scan I had a bit of a weird reaction to the iodine. I started trembling a lot for a while after and then the same night and the day after my skin was very itchy (but I didn’t have a rash), to the point where I went to my previous GP to see if it was normal. He just told me that it was from the iodine and to get anti-histamines, which I took and it went away 1-2 days later. 

I didn’t realise that this would be a problem for future scans until I went to get my new scan done yesterday and they told me that because I had a slight reaction before I might end up getting an even worse reaction this time. They were very kind about it and told me to talk to the haematologist and ask her to give me pre-medication (I think he said it would be steroids), because they preferred to do the contrasted scan. 

I called the haematologist today and spoke to the receptionist, who then passed it on to the the doctor. The receptionist called me back later and told me to just do the non-contrasted one “for now”. I told him what the radiologist said but he just said the same thing, so I accepted it. But now I’m not sure if I should call back and tell them that I would actually prefer a contrasted one so that I just get a clear picture straight away and avoid having to do it again in the future and again be exposed to radiation. I find it weird that she said that especially because she was worried about the radiation from the beginning. 

Anyway, I don’t even know if the contrast is super necessary for the areas that I’m doing, so I just need some advice about whether I should call her again tomorrow or just leave it. She’s obviously the professional (and one of the best in the field where I live) and I don’t want to be annoying and make her feel like I’m questioning her decisions.",1,6,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hwc9c4/f27_should_i_ask_my_doctor_to_do_a_contrasted_ct/"")",2020-07-23 01:48:35,Physician Responded

Time passed and everything was fine, then when I was around 10 I noticed a small lump under my skin that was oddly sharp and shaped like a stone might be. And I remembered that was where I fell when I was younger.

Then I watched a tv show, in it somone had an arrow in them and the doctor spoke about how his body is fighting the foreign object, they need to get it out before antibiotics will fight the infection.

hwhvgz,No sensation in penis,"I am asking here as I dont know who else to ask. At the age of 12 I was circumsized due to tight forskin . I am unable to remember the sensation before the circumcision, however, post surgery I did not believe there was anything wrong and always believed it would feel different during intercourse. at 16 I became sexually active and was very underwhelmed by the sex due to a complete lack of sensation. While wearing a condom, putting my penis in a vagina gave a similar sensation to dunking it in some warm water. It was at this point that I found that there may be something wrong with me and started to notice it more through masterbation. After looking for some solutions I was unable to find any sort of information that helped and eventually gave up. I am 19 now and the problem has not gotten any better. I feel it is effecting the way in which I can connect with people and enjoy intercourse/masterbation. 

I am able to ejaculate and do feel a brief moment of pleasure around 20 seconds before I do so. My glands are numb and on the brief occasion I am able to feel any sensitivity, it is a sharp uncomfortable feeling. I do not believe that it is just the glands that are numb due to the fact there is no pleasurable sensation on any part of my penis that I touch. sex without condoms did help, however the ""pleasurable"" sensations where still not present and was only improved as I was able to slightly feel the texture? of the inside of the vagina. I masterbate what is I assume a resonable amount (5-6 times a week) but am now reducing this to try and increase sensitivity. I also have began working out for extended periods and will soon be taking zinc in the attempts to boost my testosterone levels as I have heard that this can help with penile numbness. I dont believe there is any external damage to my penis other than the scars left from the operation. Any help that could be provided would be a great help as I am slowly becoming more frustrated and feel as though Im missing out on what everyone else has.

hwiqud,Would getting a cane be excessive?,"Good morning,

A few years ago, I had a bad ankle sprain on my left ankle.  Due to the way I sit, my ankle was very flexible inwards and had two hardened skin patches where the bones were.  But I was careless, jumping on one foot, making my ankle go further inward to sprain than the average person's ankle.  I was in crutches for a few months, but it didn't help that my freshman schedule was all back-to-back across our mountainous campus, so my ankle never got the rest of needed.  To today, it takes an hour or so of activity or standing to cause some discomfort in my left ankle.

Recently, I made another careless mistake, walking off a couch, and getting a, what I feel is, mild high ankle sprain in my right leg.  I didn't go to the doctor for it, given that I didn't see it urgent enough during the pandemic, but it's been a bit over a month and my calf still has times where it hurts.  The high ankle sprain was self-diagnosed after research on why an ankle injury would lead to my calf hurting, along with the test for putting the ankle back into the position it got hurt in, causing pain to resurface in the calf.  Like my left ankle, my right calf will start to hurt after prolonged activity or standing.

As for a personal history, I am 21 years old, female.  I have PCOS and didn't have a period, up until recently, with birth control assistance.  Thought I was lucky to not have a period until I realized I was heading to Osteoporosis lane.  When I got my wisdom teeth removed, the pain was excruciating for a month before it finally started decreasing.  To my surprise, that was not the case for the people around me.  I was also malnutritioned and my body was in starving mode for the past 3.5 years.  It was only until the past couple months, with the assistance of my mother, that I was able to finally get my body out of starving mode and into a healthier range.  Hopefully I'll be able to keep it out of starving mode from now on, that state's difficult to beat.  I have fainted a few times and regularly had minor black-outs due to these struggles constantly keeping me on the edge.  I just required a little nudge sleep, food, exertion, or temperature-wise to push me into fully fainting.  Not very fun.  You can probably guess that I've lost my muscles and have become significantly weaker after all this time.  I'm hoping to build myself back up.

Now, with all this in mind, I've been debating getting a cane to use for my left ankle and right calf.  I'm hoping that will somehow alleviate the pain and allow me to increase my physical activity outside of the home.  I'm just afraid that maybe bringing a cane with me everywhere is overdramatic, since I don't have any serious reason to.  I want to increase my activity, become stronger, and be able to last as long as the next healthy person with simple activities like walking around or standing for 30 minutes.

Should I invest in a walking cane?  Would it be okay for me to use a cane whenever I'm outside of the home?

hwis2h,How Do I report Medical Professionals for Not Wearing Masks?,"I'm not sure where to ask this. I tried a couple subs and it was removed. If this isn't the place, I'd be grateful if someone pointed me in the right direction.

Basically, I went to see my endocrinologist today. Multiple workers were not wearing masks, including two receptionists, three back office workers, and one other employee who was walking the halls and handing paperwork to patients. Several other employees were wearing masks but only their mouths were covered. Even the doctor had their nose uncovered. Only 4 or so workers were wearing properly. 

I had a growth on my thyroid, so I felt like I had to have the appointment, regardless of mask wearing. I refused to go to the receptionists who were not wearing masks at all and said why, but I didn't talk to anyone else about it. 

The more I think about it, the more upset I am. All of the patients were wearing masks properly. Our temperatures were taken at the door. Why weren't staff complying? I'm already immune compromised and afraid of thyroid cancer. It just feels totally wrong. I get more and more anxious the more I think about it.

hwk4r6,How to measure underarm temperature,"\[23F\]

So this might sound obvious but the logic thing to do is to turn on the digital thermometer, put it under the arm and wait until it beeps. However, I noticed that if I ""pre-heat"" the thermometer under the arm for a few minutes and then turn it on the reading a bit higher.

This particular device seems to beep after 10 seconds of not measuring any increases, which seems a bit too fast, and I'm wondering if it's meant to compensate some inner workings or if the ""real"" reading is the one that doesn't change if I leave it in a while longer. I don't imagine doctors wait 5 minutes to get a temperature reading, so do they compensate for this? Or are expensive brands more efficient and give a faster, more accurate result?

If I turn it on and wait for it to beep I get 37.4ºC which is a bit warm but not really a fever, but if I wait a few minutes and turn it on again I get 38ºC, which is definitely a low fever. I've been having mild respiratory symptoms for a few weeks so I'm waiting to see if I can get tested for COVID-19, but I'm wondering if I have a fever or not.",1,8,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hwk4r6/how_to_measure_underarm_temperature/"")",2020-07-23 10:39:09,Physician Responded

Hello, not sure where to begin with this one. I've had a rash at the base of my penis for maybe half a year now, maybe more.

I'm posting about this as I won’t see my Dr. for another couple of weeks and this might be gone by then (she specializes in PH and was contracted by gov’t for COVID, now has reduced hours). 

The “rash” seems to be very tiny vesicle/blistery like spots, you can almost scrape them off. They are red but the skin around them is not red. They are not particularly itchy, but that could be due to the small size and spacing. They began showing up a couple of days ago. Nothing in particular about my diet/life/skincare/etc has changed that I can think would cause this. I want to stress that I’ve had this before, I tend to notice it right under my eyebrow on the inner corner first, but it tends to come every few months maybe, sometimes worse than this. Also, I’ve had perioral dermatitis and these lesions do not feel the same.

For my general medical history... I have many bizarre symptoms overall, so really tough for me to know what is normal/abnormal and what might be relevant if anything. I currently have a few things on the go with my GP, so I will try to outline everything briefly. If you don't feel this is important, please skip ahead.

A lot of things seem to be positional or at least worse when vertical, including high HR (had a 24/hr Holter &amp; also track on my apple watch), migraines, vertigo, tinnitus, light-headedness, blood pooling in feet (swollen and blueish-purple/red), brain fog. Some of these do also sometimes occur regardless of position. My Dr. most recently mentioned POTS being a possibility but has ordered more bloodwork and said we can go from there.

I also have large tonsils and recurring tonsil infection (waiting for tonsillectomy), recurring ear pain, recurring rashes of varying types and locations (cannot pinpoint the cause of any of them), flushing, temperature sensitivity &amp; Raynaud’s, nerve pain, random gastrointestinal pain, really heavy/painful periods, joint pain and weakness.

hwp14d,"Sore uterus, especially with pressure. Periodic for the last week or two, but becoming more constant and slightly more intesnse. (it doesn't feel like cramps.) Possible IUD issue?","22F, 5'8"", 160-165 pounds, white. 

For the last week or two, I've been feeling periodic soreness around my uterus, only lasting about 10-20 minutes on average. It's becoming more and more frequent (like from every other day to daily), and the last two days have included longer durations of the soreness. I felt a pretty strong pain about three hours ago, and it's been sore ever since. I think it's slightly more intense, too, but it's nowhere near unbearable. It does hurt more when I press on it: directly around the area of my uterus/cervix/vagina, and even to the sides, but not any higher or lower.   


I've had an IUD since June 2018 with no problems, no period, very very minimal cramping maybe once every 4 months, which is about what I had prior to the IUD. I had chlamydia in November but have remained with the same partner since; we both received treatment. I've also had two yeast infections since April.  


I'm sexually active, drink a few times per week, and don't smoke. I regularly exercise and eat healthy. I'm not currently taking any medications--the last medication i took regularly was isotretinoin for a little over 4 months, ending in March.

 Also all of the food I’ve had before these 3 days where eaten by my other siblings who are perfectly fine. I’ve researched and taken tests online and the results have no correlation.

Age 16, 6’1, 160 lbs, male, no medication, no smoking, I had asthma or some breathing issue at age 3 but it has gone away as I got older, aside from that no medical issues.

Anyways, onto my issue.

Just after I finished supper yesterday, I rubbed my right eye with the palm of my right hand in a circle motion, and while I was moving my hand up, my eyelid followed and I pushed directly on my eye with the palm of my hand.

There was no seemingly serious or threatening damage done, however the sclera (white part of eye) was extremely red and it was causing me slight, yet irritating pain. 

A little over 24 hours later, my eye is no longer red, however the slight aching pain is still here, and it occasionally feels like I have an eyelash stuck in my eye. The pain hasn’t gotten worse, but it hasn’t gotten better.

Will the pain ever go away? Is there anything I can do to help make it go away? Should I keep my eye shut? Any and all advice/info is greatly appreciated since I value my eyes/my vision greatly.

So, I'm on my way to having orthognathic surgery. For the NADs in the audience, it's essentially a realignment of the jaws. There is no real downtime after the surgery. You can - and are actually encouraged - to get up and walk around shortly after the surgery. Clots most certainly happen with this surgery, but they are confined to the sinuses and usually come out on their own.

I have heard of some research stating that cessation of HRT isn't always necessary in transgender patients. I'm wondering if I can potentially continue my transition throughout the process by using bio-identical progesterone (zero clot risk) and injectable bio-identical estrogen (extremely small clot risk) and simply getting up and walking around every so often.

hwsg0r,"My wife is a medical Anomaly, and in pain. We've exhausted our resources. PLEASE HELP","TLDR at the bottom, but I assure you, you need to read the entire thing to understand.REPOST FROM:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/hwk71m/my\_wife\_is\_a\_medical\_anomaly\_and\_in\_pain\_weve/](https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/hwk71m/my_wife_is_a_medical_anomaly_and_in_pain_weve/) (Was advised to post here as well)

&amp;#x200B;

May 2019, my wife (27) woke up to use the bathroom. When she had finished using the bathroom, her stool was mainly blood and some type of white fatty tissue. This was very random and she had no prior history of poor bowel movements. (picture [https://imgur.com/lv8g9pk](https://imgur.com/lv8g9pk))

) She wanted to go to the emergency room. I thought she was over-reacting, so I dropped her off at the ER since she seemed fine and wasn't in any pain but wanted to get it checked out, and I went to work.

Fast forward about 90 minutes, and I'm getting a phone call from the medical staff that shes going in for surgery and that they already started drugging her up for surgery so she could not sign her own paperwork and that they needed me to come in.

I rushed to the ER in a panic. She had about 10 interns around her super excited to get into surgery, at the time I thought it was odd to be excited to crack open a 27 year old woman. I was informed that during her CT scan that there was a mass found and that they needed to make a 3 inch incision and take a biopsy of the mass, and that the surgery should only take about an hour. I agreed to the surgery and signed the paperwork.

3.5 hours later, my wife comes out of surgery. They had informed me that there ""was no mass"" and believed it to be Intussusception (where your intestines slide into each-other, wont allow food to pass.) They decided to make another 8-inch incision vertically up her abdomen and pull out her intestines to undo the intussusception. Their findings were that there was no intussusception, and that if there was her body had fixed itself.

the medical documents on these findings read ""patient self-corrected"".

the entire past 14 months have been my wife in agonizing pain, all things that were non-existent prior to her double surgery. She can barely keep food down, she throws up anywhere from 3-8 times a day, sometimes just bile because she cant keep food down. She constantly burps, and not tiny i-just-ate belches.. Enormous gut wrenching ""worst heartburn of your life"" releases of air, this happens all day, everyday, from the time she wakes up, until she goes to sleep. The belching is always consistent and gets worse after attempting to eat. She also suffers from severe abdomen bloating anytime she eats anything, no matter how small, no matter how ""healthy"", and also suffers from unruling consistent nausea.

my wife had NOTHING wrong with her prior to that day, she was your healthy average 27 year old girl.

We contacted a lawyer and to save you all the trouble of reading ill sum it up.. They cannot pursue a case, they agree, and the medical experts that reviewed her case say that the medical staff DID JUMP THE GUN on the surgery, but that isn't enough evidence to hold up in court because medical opinions vary.

We've seen the best Gastro doctor in our city, and he sent us a letter telling us not to come back because he exhausted his testing, and cannot assist us further. The doctor we saw performed an Endoscopy, Laroscopy, Colonoscopy, and a Capsule endoscopy and also agreed that the staff jumped the gun on her surgery and to get a lawyer, but that he could no longer help as all her tests came back fine.

So here we are, over a year later, with an enormous medical bill that eats a large percent of our income every single month (thanks insurance!). We lost our residence because my wife couldn't work after her surgery, causing us to lose our home..My wife STILL not knowing whats wrong with her, my wife being in overwhelming daily pain, and myself just having to sit by and watch her get worse and worse by the week. Her hair is falling out, and she is losing weight consistently.

I am a veteran from the US Army, and with the way things are going I'm going to have to drop out of college (my entire reason for joining the military) to go to work full time, as she cannot even work some days due to how nauseas she is on a regular basis. We are overwhelmed and I just want my wife to be healthy again, I'll stand by her forever, but its hard not being able to do anything we used to together. Some days we cant even leave the house together because she is in so much pain.

We think it was the surgery, but I'm not a doctor, and the lawyer says we don't currently have enough evidence to prove that. I feel helpless just watching her every single day, only being able to do things like rub her back and tell her its going to be ok and that we will make it through this.

I will be more than willing to answer any further question and provide information, after 14 months of exhausting resources, I figured you, the good redditors of the internet, might be able to help.

Thank you so much for your time and for reading her story.

TLDR: Wife went to the ER over bloody stool, they said she had a mass, they performed surgery. No mass, they performed an additional surgery I didn't agree to or know about, that proved inconclusive as well. Now my wife suffers from adverse effects every single day.

I used to think it was interesting how independent she was and never put two and two together that she doesn't involve me when she plays with her toys. She sometimes brings books to me to be read and hands over things when I ask but that's about it

It also hit me that she always must have something in hand (whether it is a rock, a blanket, a ball) and hardly ever goes without anything in hand

But most of all, she is non communicative. She rarely gestures (waving, clapping), hardly ever points, and does not know how to communicate what she wants other than getting behind me to push me to something OR reaching for something she wants and whining/crying without looking at me to get it. I can tell she gets very frustrated by this. This is what lead me to look into early intervention, and as I dug deeper I read about asd symptoms.

However she does smile when I smile, follow my point, and does like and play social games like hiding and peek a boo. She also loves her aunt's and uncles and does approach other kids with smiles

hwupc2,Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as a treatment for gastroenteritis?,"16M, 5'8'' 60kg

Hi r/askdocs. I'll make this short and concise. I'm currently having gastroenteritis and my GP prescribed to me activated charcoal, an aluminum hydroxide suspension antacid, and a five-day course of pantoprazole — a PPI. However, I recall reading that PPIs can exacerbate or even cause bacterial gastroenteritis due to the fact that they reduce proton pump activity. So I found it weird that it was one of the prescriptions. Is it a viable treatment option that I should resume, or should I stop using it?",1,10,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hwupc2/proton_pump_inhibitors_ppis_as_a_treatment_for/"")",2020-07-23 20:51:47,Physician Responded

hwur4r,I have gynecomastia and it hurts,"30 year old male, hispanic. 5'5"", 168 lbs


My left chesticle is pretty sensitive and hurts a lot when compressed (body armor, laying in bed on stomach, etc). I can feel the mass under/behind my nipple area. Some days its smaller than other days which I find weird. I had x-rays/mammograms which ruled out cancer or anything too bad. 

What can I do to get rid of or mitigate this issue without surgery? Are there any home remedies or vitamins? 

Will shaving off weight get rid of it ? It really didn't bother me until about 6 months ago where the discomfort transitioned to pain and it became noticeable. I work out habitually, but I also drink a lot. I don't really take supplements aside from protein and creatine from time to time.

Hello, so my wife took our little girl, who is healthy in every way, to get 4 month shots. Well the nurse goofed up and gave her a tetanus shot that she didn't need. Her first tetanus shot was at 2 months.

The pediatrician came in shortly after and told my wife they had to go through a process to report the mistake but that there shouldn't be any issues for our baby. She will be following up with us.

This freaked my wife out pretty bad. I am a little annoyed, but thought I'd ask here for people' take on any risks there might be from the extra shot.

I have a small lump that needed to be tested to see if it is cancerous. The Doctor took out about 4 to 5 of tissue samples out of my breast. I have relatively small chest (32A size) and I am concerned that if core biopsy may have changed the size of my breast or flatted it due to taking out too much tissue from my small breast. I can feel my right breast is relatively smaller than my left breast and became smaller than before. Is this possible? I hope this is not the case since doctor told me it shouldn't change the shape, but it feels like my right breast has become smaller after biopsy was done. When I compared my right breast to left side, the right breast was visibly smaller/flatter than the left breast. I can even feel my right breast smaller than left side when i touched them. Can someone please tells me if it is possible to disfigure the size of the breast by doing biopsy!!!

hwvt8m,"24, Female. 37w pregnant, High BP &amp; swelling","37w pregnant, high BP &amp; swelling

Medical Background:

-My BP is normally low and runs around 102/70

-2018 I was diagnosed with a kidney disorder and had corrective surgery. Even though my right kidney swelled 5x the normal size and sustained damage I still am in the normal range for kidney function. 

-2019 became ill with chickenpox and experienced a loss in pregnancy at 12 weeks

-Dec. 2019 got pregnant again!!!

-June 2020 (33 weeks) went into preterm labor which resulted in a 3 day stay. Drs stopped the contractions with meds 

Saturday night I began to notice reduced urine output and swelling in my hands and feet. The swelling has progressively got worse. The frequency to urinate is still present, but the output has dramatically reduced. 

I have also began to experience nausea and headaches that come and go. 

Wednesday night the swelling went to my hands, feet, and up my leg. My knees were so swollen I could hardly bend them. I called my OB and informed him of my symptoms and asked if this warranted me going to the ER now or if I could wait until the following day and have him check me during my scheduled apt. He told me to wait to see him during my apt. 

Thursday during my apt my BP was 138/102 and my OB had me go to the hospital for monitoring. 

At the hospital my BP remained in the 130s. My bloodwork and urine came back great clearing me of preeclampsia. They sent me home with a BP cuff to monitor myself at home. 
The instructions they gave me while in the hospital:

-If my BP is 140/90 or higher wait 15 minutes and take again

-If my BP is 150/100 or higher wait 15 minutes and take again and if it’s still 150/100 go back to the hospital 

-If my BP is 160/110 immediately go to the hospital 

I took my BP at 5pm it was 138/90
Went to bed at 7pm and woke up at 9pm to SEVERE SWELLING and took my BP it was 144/76 waited 15 minutes and it was 154/92 I wasn’t sure what to do so I called my OB and spoke with a Dr on call. This Dr then told me:

-Dont worry about the BP until it is 160/110 and if it is 160/110 then wait 15 minutes and take it again. If it remains 160/110 then to go to the hospital

-Not to worry if it is in the 150/100 range and not to take it again after 15 minutes and to only do that if it is again 160/110

????? I’m very confused now. 

What is the healthy range for BP at 37 weeks pregnant? I feel like I’m being forced to sit and wait until something goes wrong before I can go to the hospital for a c section (baby is breeched).

hww4qa,Had a abdominal surgery last week due to car crash need help,"M, 21, Caucasian, 180 pounds, height 6”0 

So 10 days ago I was in a high speed car accident in my friends car, I was in the backseat, went off a embankment into a big tree going about 100, lucky to be alive and thankful.

The seatbelt tore my abdominal wall halfway off and caused some serious damage to my abdomen as well as general chest muscle tests arm muscle tests and a cracked collar bone, luckily no major organs were hurt “very fortunate and lucky” I had some pretty rad seatbelt burns across my chest, my waist was destroyed on the outside and still is but it’s healing, the surgeons couldn’t see that I had internal bleeding in the CT scan but from my stats they knew there was some.

undoubtedly they had to do a emergency incision from just below my nipples to below my belly button just above my crotch, “not pretty”, turns out the bleeding was coming fro the little veins in my abdomen, thus they fixed it saving my life.

On the second day in the ICU my lung collapsed due to muscle issues from the seatbelt in my chest and the fact that I couldn’t cough out phlegm due to the immense pain in my abdomen so they had to suck it all out, fast forward 7 days later I was eventually able to walk and they released me, in two weeks I have a appointment to get my stitches removed and for the next month or two I have to wear a abdominal brace.

They’re praying and hoping that my abdominal wall and abdomen will repair itself in the coming months.  if it doesn’t I have to go in for a reconstructive/ plastic surgery to repair it. I’m also at about a 95% chance of getting a hernia or a few small ones in the meantime. 

Now to why I’m here. I had a cathider in which was removed two days before my release.
I’m wondering if that could be contributing to the pain well I pee the lain well I pee is very minor I only notice it when the streams coming to a end. , I also have incredible pain well orgasming “yep sucks”  minor pain well pooping which is getting better as well and not a issue  ejaculating is still causing some pretty rad pain spikes until I’m done and I’m really worried about it, they told me I’d have issues with peeing and popping for a few days dude to the operation on my abdomen, they never said anything about ejaculation but they cleared me for sex just be gentle obviously no thrusting. what could be causing this could it be just because of my abdomen and the fact I had major surgery 10 days ago? 

ALSO, I noticed my penis has a  bruise on it, could be from the seatbelt but I’m not entirely sure no pain when touching my penis or doing the deed just ejaculation it it’s a cramping feeling in my stomach, any thoughts or suggestions?

Since April I have had symptoms of red marks on my skin, pressure in my neck, the back of my eyes, my temples, basically throughout my head. It feels as if my nerves are bothered around my body.
Sometimes my legs or arms will start to shake too 

When I press on the top of my 7th tooth I can feel a lot of pressure around my face and right now it is intense
My 6th and 7th molar are protruded in the top of the gums.

I went to the doctors in May to do bloodwork to confirm if it was sinusitis but they said it was not.
I was given amoxicillin twice and it seemed to have soothe the symptoms but after I finished the prescription the symptoms have came back.

It seems as it is fungal infection and or something with my tooth like my wisdom teeth. 
It is scary and worries me.

hwz5su,Started taking my brothers gabapentin without any help from a physician and am having a rough time with what I think are withdrawal symptoms.,"Let me start by saying, my brother no longer takes this drug. The first time I took it was to help me sleep after a rough LSD trip, and it worked like a charm. The pills are 600mg. That was 20 days ago On the bottle it says ""take one pill as needed for anxiety"" so I figured that I could take it whenever and be fine. The second time I took it (about 8 or 9 days ago roughly), 1 pill did wonders. Having been taking various drugs for bipolar (which we now believe was a misdiagnosis), and never having tried anti anxiety medication until now, I got excited about it what it was doing for me, so I kept taking it. the thing is my tolerance built up very quickly, and I did a quick google search and found out that people are sometimes prescribed up to 3600mg. Being the genius I am, I started taking 5 pills (3000mg) at a time, sometimes 4. So yesterday I started my day and didn't take any (not that I've been taking it every morning, like I said, I've been using it ""as needed"") and I started having what I'm pretty sure are withdrawal symptoms: increased agitation, pounding heart beat, and restlessness. I went back home since I felt like crap, and decided it'd be better to take more to make the withdrawal symptoms stop. I took 3 (1800mg), and that helped mostly. Anyways, I feel really worried and I don't know how to get off of these things, nor do I know how much I should be taking, or when I should be taking them. I'm sort of freaking out here. Who knew anti anxiety meds could cause so much freakin' anxiety haha. Also, I am 20 years old, weight about 175, 5'10, and I take Lamictal (100 morning, 100 night), adderall as needed (which I took yesterday when I had those withdrawal symptoms), and i use marijuana frequently in small doses.

hx20sq,What did they see in my X-Ray?," 

Hi all, I was admitted to hospital for suspected meningitis which was luckily just a reaction to medication. During this admission I had an X-ray of my chest (I’m a 28 year old female with Pectus Excavatum) after seeing a good deal of pressure on my lungs they requested another X-ray to be taken from the right side. I was discharged the next day and a month later I have now received a letter asking me to come in for a follow up X-Ray as the radiologist requested it. This letter came from the Endocrinology department and CC’d my family doctor.

hx38ei,Stillborn Pathology Report,"I 33F lost my daughter on June 6th at 31 weeks.
Below is the pathology report. I don’t understand.

 Does this sound like a cord accident only? What does autolysis of the cord indicate? What is remote membranous bleeding?

My number 1 question: based on what you read here, was this an unfortunate accident? Is it likely to happen again?

——
Sections of placental tissues reveal mild autolysis, mostly of the umbilical cord.  Sections of the latter show unremarkable 3 umbilical vessels and Wharton jelly with no features of inflammation; few nucleated red blood cells are present within fetal circulation but the number appears to be within normal limits for gestational age.  Sections of fetal membranes reveal meconium laden macrophages within amnion and unremarkable chorion; decidua shows focal hemosiderin laden macrophages, consistent with remote membranous bleeding.  Sections of placental disc show early thrombus in one stem vessel and postmortem artifacts, including luminal reduction, obliteration and recanalization of stem vessels, stromal overgrowth in placental villi and focally decreased number of intravillous capillaries.  Basal plate appears unremarkable.  Placental disc tissues are negative for inflammation.

Other Comments: Hypercoiled (approximatley four coils per 10-cm interval). The cord is diffusely dusky tan-purple throughout. Towards the proximal end is a kink that is located 7 cm from the cord insertion site. The dusky purple discoloration is slightly more pronounced distal to this area of kinking.


Placental Disc
Weight: 311 g.                             
Size: 14.5 x 11.5 x 2.3 cm.                                    
Shape: Oval.
Fetal Surface: Blue-grey and unremarkable.                     
Fetal Vessels: Unremarkable.                  
Maternal Surface: Complete.       
Parenchyma: Spongy, red-brown, and unremarkable.         


Preterm, singleton placenta, induced labor for IUFD/spontaneous delivery:
-Placental disc weighs 311 g, at 25th percentile for gestation.
-Hypercoiled, trivascular umbilical cord with a tight curl at 7 cm from the placental insertion site.
-Meconium staining, fetal membranes.
-Features of focal chronic membranous bleeding.
-Early thrombus in stem vessel.
-Postmortem artifacts are present.
-Negative for features of inflammation.

Here is a link to a photo on imgur: https://imgur.com/a/lEzH1c2

Does anyone know what this bump on my thigh could be caused by? I’m almost certain I have it because I was scratching this area intensely the other day, I’m not sure if I injured a muscle or what because it was as though I could feel the bump physically rise and it hurt a bit when I walked. It doesn’t really hurt now unless I’m deliberately touching it but the bump is still there. Is there a name for this? I just wanna make sure it’s not something serious

I have asthma (not triggered very often unless I run intensely or if there is a severe pollutant), food allergies (all nuts, eggs, certain beans, and certain fruits), and eczema (at this point i’m pretty sure it’s it’s a combo of genetic susceptibility and heavily environmentally triggered, ever since i moved back with my parents it’s been exacerbated despite my new eating habits and i’m convinced it’s something to do with my house- idk if it’s paint or what). Family history of diabetes on my dad’s side which I haven’t shown any signs of that I’m aware.

This is just a quick question but I’m wondering if it is normal for bug bites to last longer than a week?

That bonfire was on the 13th and I’m just wondering if it’s normal for bug bites to last this long. I’m worried that if it’s not normal than these may not actually be bug bites but a rash of some sort. I’m pretty sure I was bitten by mosquitoes or sand fleas if that helps. The bites also have become lighter over the past couple of days but they’re definitely still there. They were never really that itchy either.

**Sex**: M

**Height**: 5' 10""

**Weight**: 145lbs

**Race**: White

**Duration of complaint**: rapid onset, lasted several minutes

**Location**: Chest

**Any existing relevant medical issues**: none that I know of

**Current medications**: Valacyclovir 800mg PO x1

**Include a photo if relevant**: None

I want to give a brief summary of the last few months and list everything that has changed to be as concrete as possible.

Over the last 6-9 months I have slowly lost about 15lbs which I can say was due to me eating less than usual. I struggle to eat breakfast normally but there have been several days where I wont eat for 8+ hours and have my first full meal around dinner time which I know is very unhealthy. It has seemed like my appetite just isn't the same as it used to be and I find myself getting full quicker than usual (there are some days where I struggle to eat 1400 calories).  I know that fasting and having very low-carb diets can result in Ketosis, and after reading I decided to buy some urine-ketone test strips that will be here very soon. Knowing that Ketosis and Ketoacidosis are similar but ***vastly*** different I wanted to check my blood glucose this morning (8:30am pre-breakfast) and it was 103 which doesn't stick out as alarming (I did eat dinner late last night). 

Now to get into marijuana and how it affected my heart; I have been smoking weed for about a year and a half and there has been three occurrences in the last three months to where I have smoked and within 5-10 minutes my heart rate climbs to &gt;150bpm. This never happened previously and I am not *attributing* it to weed but smoking was what brought the issue to my attention. Before I go further I want to say I have stopped smoking in the mean time while I figure out what is causing this. The most recent time my heart rate jumped up was this last weekend 7/18 (this was another day where I hadn't eaten in 8+ hours). I smoked a blunt (weed rolled in tobacco leaf) and within a few minutes my heart was racing, and I suddenly felt nauseous. I stood up to go to the bathroom because I wasn't sure if I was going to throw up or not and I just sat on the toilet trying to catch my breath. I have never felt my heart beat like this before and I was really worried at the time (being high and thinking you are having a heart attack would only made my anxiety worse). I didn't have any chest pain and didn't feel any radiation to my arms or jaw. After about 5 minutes in the bathroom I came out and started sipping on water and eating tortilla chips to try and get some food into my system as quickly as possible which seemed to help. My heart rate slowly declined over the next 10-15 minutes to a more normal pace, and after eating dinner I felt much better. 

Since this has happened unexpectedly three times now I am convinced that I have a heart murmur or that I was in a rhythm like afib from smoking marijuana. Other ideas I have come across are stomach/digestive problems (low appetite and feeling full after a few bites) or acid reflux. After doing hours and hours of reading I have seen other people have associated symptoms while smoking due to panic attacks but I have to wonder if that was me since I had smoked many times before and never had this happen. Once I have the urine-ketone test strips I can test to see if there are ketones in my urine which might indicate DKA, but I know those symptoms come on very fast which mine have happened over months. I am not constantly urinating, I don't have abdominal pain, and haven't been fatigued more than normal. The whole ordeal has me terrified to ever smoke weed again and now I am shifting my focus towards taking better care of my body (eating more often, starting to exercise again) because of my age. It's now been almost a week since I stopped smoking and I have not experienced any symptoms like I once did.",1,10,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hx5jba/rapid_heart_rate_after_smoking_marijuana/"")",2020-07-24 10:01:54,Physician Responded

hx5ru7,Brother and I suffered seizures a month apart,"About a month ago I suffered my first ever seizure which began with me visualising lights which I can only compare to fireworks. I first thought I was having a panic attack but almost instantly lost consciousness. When I came to I was incredibly confused, was apparently speaking French (which I have barely spoken in years) and didn't recognise my partner, who said I'd been convulsing for a few minutes. After emptying the contents of my stomach, I waited for an ambulance, went to the hospital, and had blood tests which came back relatively fine (except for a slightly high white blood cell count). The doctor said it was most likely due to the fact that I was regularly going days without sleeping as well as drinking heavily (didn't have much else to do during lockdown, but this occasion wasn't notably different from what I've been doing since I was 18, now 26). They referred me to a neurologist to have a brain scan which is next week.
Today my brother also suffered a seizure, which is abnormal (except for a febrile seizure he had when he was three years old). He's a year older than me but lives a completely different lifestyle. He's never been much of a drinker and will usually be in bed by 11pm. As it stands I don't have much information on the details of his episode, but it seems he's okay.

Neither of us have (luckily) ever suffered from any neurological disorders, or really any health problems that we know of (other than his episode when he was three) and neither has anyone in our immediate family.

My question is whether it's a common occurrence to have two siblings exhibit the same neurological symptoms at similar ages, such as a seizure, or is this most likely just a very odd coincidence?

I saw two surgeons. One encouraged me to remove my gallbladder because the polyp is close to 1cm and I’m young enough to recover quickly. The other disagreed and thinks I should see a gastroenterologist, get a nuclear scan of my gallbladder, and image again in six months. She isn’t sure my pain is being caused by my gallbladder and said polyps are generally symptomless. Her reasoning with my youth was that I should try to keep it as long as possible. 

I’m at a loss. I did see a GI doc three years ago because of diarrhea and anemia and had a colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, capsule endoscopy, and barium swallow. It showed lymphoid hyperplasia in my terminal ileum and nothing else. I am not willing to be subjected to those tests again.

It really doesn't affect me in my day to day life - I've pretty well adapted my gait to that difference.

I've also never broke a bone, but I continually hear that the femur is the worst bone to break, or one of the worst.

My question is, will a controlled break from a doctor be as awful as it sounds? Do they break the bone in a way that is far safer than if I snapped my femur in some sort of accident?

hx7a8l,Eye movement causing neuropathy?,"40F, 5'6"", 210lbs, Hx: depression, anxiety, hypertension, migraines

For the last 3 days I've been experiencing what feels like electric shock sensations in my hands and fingers as well dizziness  when moving my eyes. If I focus on one point while seated or lying down I'm ok. Looking around while walking is awful. To the point of almost feeling nauseated. Looking around while seated causes the same shock like sensations. I previously had experienced similar sensations while under stress maybe 2 years ago. At the time my physician thought it might be new Rx for metformin that I had started taking for PCOS. I have had my blood sugar checked to be certain it wasn't neuropathy like symptoms associated with diabetes. My blood glucose has been fine. I have not changed anything in my diet or started any new medications lately. My last vision check a year ago was normal. Seems very odd that these sensations are happening only when moving my eyes. In addition I have noticed more tearfullness as of late but this does happen on and off d/t depression which I have been on treatment for since I was around 11/12. Not even sure where to start with this. I haven't been able to find anything regarding peripheral shock sensations being prompted by vision. Is it possible it's simply a nutrient deficiency or related to anxiety? As a side note, I don't eat meat very often and probably don't have the healthiest of diets although this too has not changed recently. 

Any suggestions of possible directions to look in would be much appreciated. Short of just getting a CBC done I'm not sure what else could be done.",2,6,"=HYPERLINK(""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/hx7a8l/eye_movement_causing_neuropathy/"")",2020-07-24 11:34:22,Physician Responded
hx7hk2,Neck pains causing eye issues - please help me figure this out!,"Age 30M

Height 6ft

Weight 140

Duration of complaint 3 months

Location England

Current medications - Thealoz Duo and Amitriptyline 10mg


Started around 3 months ago, although some symptons may have been longer..

I was laying down watching some tv. My eyes felt lkike they locked up while focusing on a moving object. The best way to describe it would be it felt like my eyes cramped up. It was painful and i felt it from behind my eyes through my head.
 I have an absolutley awful posture and basically rest on the back of my neck with my head pushed forward.

So after that first 'episode' Things have just got worse day by day. I have had worse days than others with no pattern.  

I seem to be very sensitive to light now. I am unable to leave the flat at night at all as bright lights actually hurt my eyes quite a bit. To the point i feel like i will pass out.

Depending how i sit i can aleviate some of the symptons. For example i could let my head hang to the side and it feels better.

The worst part is my eyes. They constantly feel numb. Its like there are bulding veins in my eye sockets that my eys rub against that causes pain. Also a vein in my eyelid thats very painful.

Im unable to put any pressure on or around my head at all. If i do it will cause server pain through the veins in my head.  Resting my head when in bed is very hard. 

I constantly feel numb/tenderness through the front of my neck and back of neck at bottom of head.  Just touching my skin can cause pain.
I also occasionally have a numb left hand and leg.
Moving my eyes up and down is far  more easier than moving sideways. Just now Im looking at my backlit keyboard. As i focus from key to key its like my vision flashes. Its not a smooth transion as is very uncomfortable.


What have I done so far to find out whats wrong:
Head Scan - All Clear
Eye doctor and Optomotrist - All Clear
GP - Gave me Amitriptyline - Tried for a month but the pressure it gave my in my eyes just made the pain so much worse.
Chiropractor - He said I have a really bad neck and back and that it is whats causing my tension headaches (although after research i don't know if i should listen to him or even return. I have now seen the Chiropractor 5 times)


Im at my wits end. Ive been living off my savings for 3 months now as I usually work from a computer. Im very depressed abuot this whole situation!

I would very very much appreciate any advice people can offer.. Especially if you have excperienced this before!

I would assume that its normal that my body starts producing more urine now that i drink more liquids, but i feel like once im done peeing (it takes a bit for me to pee it all out too) it will take about 30mins, more or less, before i feel like i need to go pee again. Sometimes it isnt just the slight urge to pee, but like a full blown feeling of ""if i dont go pee rn i will piss myself""

hxc5a8,Strange red patchs of skin on leg? Should I be concerned?,"For reference (I am planning to get a referral to my dermatologist on Monday) but I'm just curious for a second opinion as to whether I should be concerned, or what my dermatologist might say?

Edit: Here is a link to the patches I am talking about: [https://imgur.com/a/phuLrBU](https://imgur.com/a/phuLrBU)

Details: I am a 24F who is white and some-what healthy. Recently diagnosed (3 months ago) with Celiac Disease and I have chronic iron-deficiency because of it. I weight 134 and height around 5'5 I think? (I suspect that I've had Celiac for 10 years now, as my iron-deficiency first started when I was 13 years old). This is currently being dealt with now though...

As for the red patches on my left leg... I have two red patches. One larger one (approx 2-3 thumbnails in size) on the side of my calf, and the second smaller one (approx 1 thumbnails in size) on the back of my calf. The larger patch ranges in colour from red to pink, it appears dry (possibly could be considered scaly, not sure) and it itches occasionally but no pain. Its been on my leg for approx a year now and hasn't gone away, changed in size or shape (although it slowly grew in size and now has been the same size for a while). The patch is not perfectly round, it sorta looks looks like a wonky star, it is not symmetrical. The smaller patch has some red but more dull-brownish pink, it has the same texture at the larger patch. Also occasionally itches, with no pain. Its been on my leg for approx 6-7 months, also started small and grew to the size it is now. Not sure how to describe the shape of the patch, although it is more symmetrical than the larger patch, it isn't fully symmetrical, its a very strange shape, almost like an ink-blot.

The reason why I'm going to get it checked out is because my mom told me recently that my dad has had (in the past) skin cancer and I DID NOT KNOW THAT so now I'm really paranoid that it could be... My mom doesn't seem concerned and she thinks its eczema, but I have eczema on my hands and it usually gets better with creams and medications, however I'd used multiple types of non-medicated cream and medicated cream on my leg and the patches stay the same...

hxcl1h,Chances of recovery from 30% lung capacity - COVID,"Age: 40
Sex: Male
Height: 6'2
Weight: 275lbs

Hey docs,

My girlfriend's father is currently in the hospital for ""suspected"" coronavirus. He's been sick for just over a week now and has been drastically losing the battle. 

He's a healthy 40s non-smoker with no known underlying health conditions. He is slightly obese but in a healthy way. 

When he first got sick he was at home and really puffed up and coughing. Other than that he was in good spirits. After about 4-5 days he was admitted to a hospital where they don't have ventilation but oxygen tanks and he has been declining in health there.

His first xray indicated that 1/4 of his right lung was killed off or white and today (about 3 days after admission) we recieved news that he's at 30% lung capacity and requires oxygen at all times. 

Can someone please just be straight up with me here and give me some sort of ballpark on the chances to recovery? He's been taking dexamethasone since the admission to the hospital and been relatively strong throughout the battle.

At this point I would just like to be prepared for what is to come.

For the past 2 years, I feel like like some  people (who I don’t personally know, might be celebrities or people I used to like or just random people in general) are watching me at home when I’m by myself or with my family, and judging me for the most simple actions and tasks and daily necessities: Going to the toilet? Gross. Preparing a meal? You’re doing it the wrong way, haha. Practicing my religious beliefs? Ridiculous (?) Dressing in a certain way? What the hell are you wearing. Taking a selfie? You’re not pretty/you look foolish. Listening to music? Your taste sucks. Reading a certain book (on wattpad)? What are you, 9? They basically ridicule literally everything I do. 
I started doing some some extremely normal stuff in the dark (like going to the toilet with lights off) so that they can’t see me. I’m worried about what they think or that they’re laughing at me to the point that I don’t even enjoy stuff I used to. And I even started talking to myself as if I was making clarifications and justifications to them regarding what I’m doing. 

Also, I don’t think these are exactly hallucinations but I sometimes see shadows with the corner of my eye, but I think it’s just as normal as mistaking a pile of clothes for a ghost. And very recently I smelled a hideous smell twice in two different places. The first time was in my grandma’s house two weeks ago, I’ve smelled it the whole night for no reason. And the second time was two days ago in my house, again for no reason and it was the exact same smell.

Someone suggested I have social anxiety but I don’t act weird around actual people. Only people my brain imagines. I read a lot about it online and I think I either have paranoia or some schizophrenic/schizoïde/schizoaffective disorder.

hxe9ci,Help Please! 20F Relative survived self inflicted gunshot wound to head 2 weeks ago. Hospital planning discharge in 24 hours due to no insurance. She has medicaid out of AZ but will not help transfering it to FL. Diagnosed Schizophrenic/BLPD/Depression etc,"Hello, everyone. Im not sure this is the correct place to post this but I'm at a loss right now concerning a close relative of mine. 2 weeks ago, I received a phone call at work saying that this relative of mine had shot themselves in the head in my house. My house was sorrounded in crime scene tape and police squad cars. It took over an hour to find out she was not deceased, and over 24 hours to find out she was actually the one who made the call to 911 post incident. Doctors were amazed that not only did she survive and was conscious and had the alertness to call 911 but that the bullet somehow meraculaously failed to hit any major areas of the brain that caused what they believe to be permanent damage other than permanent blindness in her right eye and a few other comparatively minor issues.

Long story short, she is a psychiatrists dream, schizophrenic, multiple personalities, depression, borderline personality disorder, etc. She has a history of evident self harm, sexual abuse, and other tragic history.

She moved in with me with no identification but with medicaid out of the state of Arizona. We live in Florida. It has been just over 2 weeks since the incident and the case workers at the hospital have been ZERO help in helping get insurance through medicaid or even trying to transfer medicaid from Arizona to here. As such, the hospital is planning on releasing her in the next 24/48 hours and will not give us any information other than ""the doctor deemed her fit to return home."" This is ABSOLUTELY CRAZY NEGLIGENT, AThis person literally has an entire journal of hundereds of pages of evidence in her own handwriting that proves she's not fit for release yet. We want her home but she needs to get help, but I'm afraid without insurance the hospital is brushing her off. We both work full time and are absolutely terrified of leaving her alone, for one not fully recovered and secondly the first and only time she's been left alone attempted to kill herself in our house and very nearly succeeded. (she just moved in 3 days prior).

I am at a total loss, due to covid 19 we are not able to actually be in the hospital to talk and everything is done via phone to no help.

I'm so scared that the hospital is going to release her and she could have another schizophrenic episode and have another attempt on her life. With no insurance we also cannot afford the medications she's being prescribed.

I am in search of some, any advice as to how to get her the help she needs with the hospital refusing to budge on discharge, this is so negligible and feel they might sign her death warrant over insurance.

I live a few states over so it’s not easy to go there to help. 

What type of doctor should he be seeing to get better treatment? Is this an emergency situation?

When I was 19 I went to a gastroenterologist with all of my complaints (acid reflux, chronic constipation mixed with diarrhea, sever bloating and abdominal pain, etc.) They essentially told me the only thing to worry about was the reflux and prescribed Zantac. Fast forward and I take a pre/probiotic mix and Metamucil to help regulate BMs. But the new issue is sulfur burps and excess reflux. They taste disgusting (obviously) and the only solution I’ve found is to drink baking soda mixed with water to make myself throw up. They’re always combined with painful bloating and gas. I’ve had sulfur burps before but maybe once a year. I’ve had them 3+ times in the last week and it’s debilitating for the day until I can throw up and get the cramping and bloating to go away.

hxi56l,ER can't tell what's wrong with me,"I am a 25yo male, hispanic, 5'8 and 140 lbs. I went to the ER last night because I started having severe bloating since three days ago, and then it became painful. I thought it might be normal, just a lot of gas or something before last night, so I had stuck to eating very lightly so as not to make it worse before I could have a bowel movement and relieve the pressure. Suddenly I started feeling that pressure on my upper left leg toward the hip, and on my lower back. At that point I started to freak out a little and decided to go to the hospital.

They gave me a CT scan, ruled out appendicitis, then took my blood and urine. The doctor said they didn't find anything on any of the tests. They just said (the ER doc along with a surgeon who took a look at the CT) that I definitely have a large amount of stool built up, and that I need to take a strong laxative and go to a GI specialist to try and figure out what caused it. I took the laxative this morning, and it actually helped a ton, but since then I ate a small bowl of rice and now my gut is swelling again. If I feel any pain at all or the swelling gets worse I'll go to the hospital again but I have no idea what could be causing this or if they'll even give me the correct tests, or if it's an emergency at all. Also, wouldn't the blood or urine tests show if it was something really bad like cancer?

hxj69d,"Is Nexium dangerous? Scared to switch medicines but in extreme pain, please help.","31F, 120kg, white, not into drinking/smoking/drugs. 

I've been diagnosed with severe gastritis which started this year due to stress, currently waiting for a scope appointment. The pain is extreme, to the point I ended up in the ER almost passing out and had to spend the day there. I don't have any heartburn or reflux just pain in my stomach like someone is twisting it and it hurts across my whole body if I lay on either side. It radiates to my back.

My test results: My blood test results were 100% good. My pancreas and liver good (ultrasound + blood). My kidneys good (blood + urine). My urine is good. My heart is good (EKG). Gallbladder was removed years ago but pain is similar just in more places.

I was prescribed Ranitidine 300mg but due to Covid it's hard to get and my pharmacy has run out now, so my doctor prescribed Nexium 20mg instead along with antibiotics. This wasn't a proper discussion with a plan, it was rushed with no conversation. I didn't learn about the side effects until I got home.

My doctor and pharmacist are both gone for the weekend and I've called another GP but he told me to ""do what I like"" so I'm hoping someone can talk to me about my worries and fears here because I need to take medicine to heal...and my GP has said he doesn't understand this so I need help please...

1. Ranitidine has far less side effects and essentially does the same thing (reduces stomach acid). [Nexium has 10% on all these side effects](https://www.drugs.com/sfx/nexium-side-effects.html) while [Ranitidine has 0.01% for the same ones](https://www.drugs.com/sfx/ranitidine-side-effects.html). Some of Nexiums side effects include damaging organs and even vision loss, I don't want to shorten my life if I can take a safer pill. Yes maybe I will be one of the lucky ones but if I'm not it's just too late. I have confirmation my organs are healthy I don't want to damage them.
2. I'm on [Celebrity Slim Rapid shakes](https://www.celebrityslim.com.au/shop/shop-by-phase/rapid-phase/celebrity-slim-rapid-chocolate-shakes-840g) which are essentially multivitamins and I am taking [mega magnesium suppliments](https://www.ethicalnutrients.com.au/products/megazorb/ethical-nutrients-megazorb-mega-magnesium-240-tablets-1) for muscle cramps in my legs. Nexium info says it interacts with iron and magnesium and B12 but not how. Do I need to stop these shakes to make it safe?
3. Everything I'm reading says Nexium is not safe long term, and should be taken no more than 2 weeks at a time and no more than 3 times a year, and should be weaned off. But ulcers take months to heal and my gastritis is pretty severe so I don't think 2 weeks is going to cut it.
4. Today I took Ranitidine. Is it safe to take Nexium tomorrow or do they need a gap between them? I have 1 Rantidine pill left so I could get a new script Monday and travel to find it.
5. Can I ask my GP for a referral to a specialist of some kind? He has said he doesn't understand this condition or treatment, or the medicine.

hxjb1i,Drug Induced Myocardial Infarcation?,"27M, White, 5""11 175lbs, Smoker (I've quit since the event).

July 11th I started doing cocaine with a friend at 4:00pm, she likes to do a lot and I followed suit. At 10:30, I had probably done a little more than half of a gram, maybe 3/4 gram, I was sitting on the couch and extended my right arm across my torso to grab a drink on my left, turning slightly. At this point I felt a sharp sensation jolt from the left side of my heart across to the right side. It subsided over the course of 30-45 seconds, after this I was feeling light headed and felt numbness down the underside of my left arm, a little bit of the same on the right. My heart rate seemed faint, I was able to control my breathing fine. I tried walking around to keep my blood flowing for 10 minutes and was feeling tingling/slightly numb patches come and go across my body. Mainly on the back of my left side hip, but all over too. After this, I remembered that asprin is supposed to help with heart attacks and my friend took me to the corner store to get some. I chewed it and swallowed with some gatorade and started recovering after this.

All week I've felt fairly fatigued (still haven't been able to catch up on sleep entirely), but more notedly I've been noticing a lingering sensation from where the original jolt fired in my heart, it comes and goes and is more noticeable sometimes than others, usually when I'm inactive at a given moment.
